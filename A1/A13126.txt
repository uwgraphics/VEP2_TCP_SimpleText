TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE AND VIRTUOUS LADY, THE LADY HARINGTON.
MADAME, the late pestilence in Couentrie, which occasioned my translation etc.
of this History, moved me also, in part, to address the same unto your Honor.

For being altogether restrained then, from free practice of my profession
abroad, and no less impatient of idleness at home, I could not readily think
of a better course to spend that vacation, than in an Argument having a
reference to mine old Grammatical Muses, and according; in some ^ort, with my
latter studies in Physic. What hours therefore, either the doubtful or
diseased estate of my neighbors, together with the meditations of mine own
mortality would afford, I employed gladly in the said Subject.

Again, for as much as the self same cause debarred me from access unto your
house at Comb (a duty that otherwise the vicinitie of our abode did require)
I fully resolved at the finishing of those my Sedentary labors, to present the
same to your view: thereby to shield my self (whom it pleased you before time
to grace with kind entertainme^t) from the just imputation of rude negligence
in that behalf. But now, since the same city so dangerous the year before,
is become a retyring place of safety for your Household, and has to me
already yielded fit opportunity to excuse my former absence personally by
word of mouth, I have presumed nevertheles to dedicate the same unto your
Honor, as a token of my thankfulness for your bounteous favor, far above
the proportion of my deserts, and an earnest penny of that propense mind,
which I carry to honor your name, in the best manner I could devise.

And verily calling to my remembrance how courteously you have vouchsafed
heretofore to accept even at second hand my travails in this kind, and with
good words testified oftentimes the contentment you received therein, I had no
reason to doubt the like acceptance of that which out of a loving and devote
heart I offer first unto your self.

Lastly, when I consider, how together with sincere piety, rare wisdom, and
other eminent virtues, there is seated in your person a singular affection to
advance good literature, with an extraordinary respect of learned men, I knew
no means out of my small fortunes to do you greater honor, than by entituling
you as Patroness of that, which may benefit young Scholars, my countrymen,
that would be learned: to give knowledge unto the word, that all the profit or
pleasure whatsoever, which shall grow unto them, from these endeavors of mine,
are derived immediately from you and for your sake bestowed upon them.

These motives, right Honorable, as well of my first enterprise, as of choosing
your Patronage, if it please you to approve, (the only thing that I humbly
crave at your hand for this present) I shall not only think my pains well
taken and choice as well made: prising your acceptance to the worth of a
competent guerdon: but also continue my hearty prayers unto the Almighty for
your perfect health, proceeding in a virtuous course of life, with increase of
true Honor here upon earth, and after the revolution of many new years, for
eternal happiness in the highest Heaven.

Your Honors most ready at command, Philemon Holland.

To the Readers.
THAT ye may with better contentment read these Historical reports of the
twelve first CEASARS, which SVETONIVS has delivered most truly, compiled as
compendiously, and digested right methodically; I have thought it good with
some few advertisments praemised, to commend the same unto you.

First therefore, whereas by the judgment of the best learned, and the
Analogy of other Histories, he seems to affect nothing so much as incorrupt
and plain truth, (the principal virtue of an Historiographer) for bearing to
meddle with those Nerv^, Traia^* and Hadri^nus (...) secretary he wa^.
Emperors in whose days he flourished; because he would not thrust himself
into danger by revealing, nor betray the liberty of a writer in concealing the
faults; much less incur the note of Flattery, extolling above measure the
good parts of Princes then living; and to that purpose penned their lives, who
were lately deceased, as one said very well, eadem liberate qua ipsi vixerunt:
if happlie in prosecuting of this point, he has recorded ought that may be
offensive to chaste and modest minds, ye shall do well to glaunce over with
your eye such places lightly, as I with my pen touched unwillingly.

Secondly, for as much as he continues in general the Narrations of the said
Princes, from before their Nativitie unto their Death and Funerals: and in the
several discourses, of their ages, affairs, virtues, vices, feature and
lineaments of body, first, after an uniform manner, proposes throughout
certain heads summarily, and then exemplyfieth the same in due order by
perticulers (a most lightsome method and way of teaching) keeping him self
still to the Subject matter, without any digressions at all: my advise is, that
for your more expedite course in reading the whole, ye direct your mind
thereunto. Now, for that his JULIUS CHASAR sorteth not with the rest, but
appears (...) as whose ancestors, birth, childhoode, etc. be not set down;
(which maime I impute rather to the injury of time, than unto the purpose or
oversight of the Author) I have in some sort supplied that defect, with the
labors of LEWIS VIVES, TORRENTIVS and others, which I find praefixed in the
last and best Editions.

Thirdly, considering that brevitie is many times the mother of Obscurity, may
it please those among you, who are not so conversant in such concise writings,
as admit not one word superfluous, to have recourse, for the clearing of some
doubts unto the margin, as also to those brief Annotations, which for their
sakes, out of mine own readings, together with the select observations of
BEROALDVS, SABELLICVS, TORRENTIVS and CASAVBONVS I have collected. Which also
will ease them of many difficulties that his succinct style and terms, not
elsewhere obvious, interlaced, may otherwise breed.

Finally, if there happen to occur some Errata, that might escape either my pen
in writing, or the ordinary diligence of mean Correctors in the printing ye
will of your judicious candor, I hope, either pass them over with connivency,
if they be literal, or else tax with some easy censure in case they be
material: So long as for your full satisfaction, ye may with small pains
before ye begin either to read or judge, correct what is amiss, according to
the Examen and Review annexed to the end of all.

Farewell.
A SVPPLEMENT TO THE BEGINNING OF C. JULIUS CEASAR DICTATOR.
THE IVLIAN lineage, as most men are persuaded, is descended from Ascanius
Iulus, the son of Aeneas by Creusa: which Iulus, after he had left Lavinium,
built long Alba: wherein also he reigned. Others, grounding upon a more assured
evidence, have thought it good to derive the same rather from Iulus the son of
Ascanius. For when after the death of (this) Ascanius* the Kingdom of the
Latins was devolved or returned unto
again upon Sylvius the son of Aeneas and Lavinia, the charge of Religion
and sacred ceremonies of the Latin and Trojan Nation both, remained yet still
in the race and progeny of Iulus: out of which are sprung the Iulij. These
(Iulij) with certain other most noble families of Latium, Tullus Hostilius
King of the Romans, after he had rased Alba, translated to Rome, and raunged
among the (...). Late it was, ^re they rose and mounted to high place of
Magistracy; but were reckoned almost in the last rank of the (...) of
ancient Nobility: and of them, the Iuli ^are the (...) (...). For C. Julius,
(son of Lucius) surnamed also Iulus, was Consul together with P (...) (...)
Rufus, in the year after the foundation of Rome city or rather 265, according
to the Chronology annexed unto Titus Livius.
264. And By the computation of Dionyfius, T. Livius, C^ssiodorus and others.
seven years after, C. Julius, or Iu^lus.
his son, with Q. Fabius Vibulanus (Consul) the second time. Again, some
space of time coming between, Vopiscus Julius, son of Caius and Nephew of
Lucius, bare the Consulshippe with L. Aemilius al. Mamercus
Mamercinus third time Consul, in the year or 28^, after the Chronology
aforesaid of Dionyfius.
280. I find likewise, that in the year more truly 303
302. Caius Julius, son of Caius, and nephew of Lucius, was a decemvir for
the enacting and (...) of Laws, and that in the former Election of that
Magistracy: as also, that Caius Julius son of Caius and Nephew of Caius,
became Consul with Marcus Geganius Macerinus, in the year 307, by Livius ac^
306. and the self same man a second time, with Lucius Verginius Trirostus in
the year 319. 320. 4^7
318: and immediately in the So ^med.
year next following, a third time, with the same Verginius now twice Consul.
And thus much for the Iu^li. For to rehearse and collect all them of that
family, together with the honorable places of every one, which were many in
number, and of sundry kinds; is not our purpose: and besides, the thing it
self is apparent and upon record in the public Registers.

Moreover, I have observed in the Julian line, a certain house also of the
Mentones: and among them, one Caius Julius, colleague in the Consulshippe with
T. Quint^s Pennus Cincinnatus, in the 322. year after the foundation of the
city. I find likewise, Caius Julius Denter to be master of the Horsemen, when
Caius Claudius Cr^ssus Sabinus Regillensis was Dictator, for to hold their
solemn assembly of Election, in the year 405. There were besides of these
Iulij, others going under the name of Libones: and of the same race one
triumphed; to wit, Lucius Julius, son of Lucius and nephew of Lucius;
companion in the Consulate which Marcus Attilius Regulus, in the year H^ply
Pomp^n 2^ of the tribe Pompun^
486. But, as touching Caius Julius son of Lucius, and surnamed Caesar (...),
whom Suetonius also meant in the 55. chapter of Julius Caesar, and Cicero
praises in his Brutus, and in the second book of his Orator, I doubt,
whether this addition ( Strabo,) should not be taken as a by-name. For,
otherwise there is in our ^ands a piece of silver coin, with the inscription
of Lucius Julius, son of Lucius, and surnamed Strabo. The Epigramme of the
former is extant among the Antiquities of Rome city, in this manner.

C. Julius, L. F. Caesar Strabo, AEd. Cur. Q. Trib. Mil. Bis XVIR. AGR. D^nd.
ADTR. IV D. Pontif.

To conclude, I have met with writers, who reckoned also among the Iulij,
certain* Annals: which, for mine own part verily, I could never yet light
upon, in searching the Records and Chronicles. But in the eight book of the
Familiar Epistles (of Cicero) and namely in the seventh letter there, of M.
Caelius unto Cicero, there is mention made among others, of one L. Julius,
son of Lucius, Pomp. Annalis: where the writing (as I suppose) is not very
certain and (...) acknowledge. For besides that the better corrected Copies
call him Villius, (for Julius) Liuie also has expressly and plainly written in
his fortieth book, that one Lucius Villius a Tribune of the Commons, made a
Law which provided and ordained, in what year of men's age they might sue for
every kind of Magistracy, and be capable thereof. Whereupon, unto that (...)
was given this surname, to be called Annals Thus far Liuius. Hereunto may
(...) (...) (...) moreover; that the Kindred Iulia, is reckoned in the Tribe
Fabia (and not Pomp^), as we have noted in the fortieth chapter of Augustus. I
am of opinion therefore, that safer (...) (...) (...) account the Annals among
the Villii, and not the Iulii. But thus much hereof, by the ^ay, and as it were
passing by; Now proceed we to the rest.

In the lineage (...) then, there was a family also of the Caesar's. But what
the reason should be of that surname, it is not certainly known; no more,
than who he was, that first bare the said (...). For, before Caesar the
Dictator, and his father and grandfather, there were Iulii na^ Cae^ares. As for
example; He, who (as Livie witnesses in his 27. book) was in the second
^unick war sent from the Senate to Crispinus the Consul, about the nomination
of a Dictatour. As for the term Cae^ares, those usually the Roman tongue

inhabitants there call Caesar: and upon that very cause, this surname first

Authors hereof, are of the meanest credit and authority. For not his progeny
alone, of all the Iulii, had this surname, but many others besides of (...)

Lucius, bare the Consulate with Pub. (...) Lupu^. Neither before these, were

Well. Caesar the Dictator was borne at Rome (when Caius Marcius and Lucius

Quintilis, which month after his death, was by virtue of the Law Antonia

SVLLA, when he had denied a good while the request of those right worshipful
persons, and his singular good friends entreating in his behalf, and yet they
persisted earnest suitors still for him, being thus importuned and at length
overcome, brake forth aloud into these words, either in a Divine prescience, or
some pregnant conjecture, Go to (quoth he) my Mrs: Take him to you, since ye
will needs have it so: but know this withal; that he whose life and safety
ye so much desire, will one day be the overthrow of the Nobles, whose side ye
have maintained with me* For in this CAESAR there be many MARII.

he made his aboade with K. NICOMEDES: not without a foul rumor raised, that
he prostituted his body to be abused by the King. which rumor he augmented
himself, by coming again into Bithynia within few days, under a color of
calling for certain money, which should be due to a ( b) Libertine and ( c)

reputation: and at the winning of MITYLENAE, THERMVS honored him with a ( a)

away immediately at the very first, to procure him money with all speed for his
ransom. After this upon the payment unto them of L. talents being set a
shore, he delayed no time, but presently put his Fleet to Sea again,
embarked, and never gave over pursuing the said Pirates, until he had
over-taken them: and no sooner were they within his power, but as he often
times had threatened in mirth, he put them all to death. Now whiles MITHRIDATES
wasted the Countries next adjoining, because he would not be thought to sit
still and do nothing in this dangerous and doubtful state of confederate
Nations and Allies to the Romans, he left Rhodes whether he had directly bent
his course, gathered a power of Auxiliarie Soldiers, expelled the Governor
under the King out of the Province, and so kept the Cities and States in their
allegiance, which were wavering and at the point to revolt.

IN his Military ( a) tribuneship, which was the first dignity after his

Questour he made as the ancient manner was Funeral Orations 6.
out of the public Pulpit called Rostra, in the praise of IVLIA his Aunt by
the Fathers side, and of his wife CORNELIA, both late deceased. And in the
commendation verily of his said Aunt, speaking of the pedigree and descent by
both sides, namely of her self, and also of her Father, he makes report in
these terms: Mine Aunt IVLIA (quoth he) by her Mother is lineally descended
from Kings, and by her Father united with the race of the immortal Gods: For,
from Ancus Marcius are derived the Marcij surnamed Reges, id est* Kings, which
name my Mother was styled with: and from VENUS the IVLII draw their original
of which house and name is our family. So then, in this stock there concur and
meet together, as well the sanctity and sacred Majesty of Kings, who among
men are most powerful, as the religious Caeremonies and service of the Gods,
in whose power Kings themselves are. In the place of CORNELIA departed, he
wedded POMPEIA, daughter of Q. POMPEIVS, and Niece to L. SVLLA. But her
afterward he divorced, suspecting that she had been naught with P. CLODIVS,
of whom there went so constant a report abroad, how at the celebration of
certain public Divine ceremonies, he being disguised in woman's aparel had
access secretly unto her, that the Senate by Decree directed a Commission to
Justices Inquisitours, for to sit upon the pollution of those sacred Rites and

Lord Pretour, he rode his circuit to keep the In head shire Towns which were

K. ALEXANDER the Great in the Temple of HERCULES there: at the sight there of

years, wherein ALEXANDER had conquered the whole world, he presently made
earnest suite for his discharge and license to depart, thereby to take the
first opportunity of all occasions to compass greater enterprises at home
within the City: and being moreover much disquieted and dismayed with a dream
the night before (for he imagined in his sleep that he had carnal company
with his own Mother) the Divinours and Wizards incited him to the hopes of
most glorious achievements, making this exposition of his dream, that thereby
was portended unto him the Soveraigntie of the whole world, considering that
his Mother whom he saw under him betokened naught else but the subjection of
the earth, which is counted the Mother of all things.

DEPARTING therefore thence before his time was fully expired, he went 8.
unto the ( a) Latin Colonies, which were now devising and in counsel to sue
for the freedom of the City of Rome, and no doubt had solicited and excited
them to attempt some tumult and trouble in the State, but that the Consuls for
the avoiding of this very dunger, kept back the Legions for a while which were
enrolled for to be sent into Cilicia.

AND yet for all that, soon after he projected greater designs within the
City. 9.
For, not many days before he entered upon his Aedileship, suspected he was A.
V. C. 688.
to have conspired with M. CRASSVS ( That had been Consul.
a man of Consular degree) with P. SVLLA likewise and Or L. rather.
P. ANTRONIVS, (who after they were Consuls elect stood condemned for suing
indirectly and by corruption for that place) to set upon the body of the Senate
in the beginning of their year; and that after they had massacred whom it
pleased them, M. CRASSVS should usurp the Dictatourship; himself be chosen by
him Master of the Horsemen: and so when they had settled the State at their
pleasure, SVLLA and ANTRONIVS should be restored again unto their Cons^lship.
Of this conspiracy, TANVSIVS GEMINVS makes mention in his Story, M. BIBVLVS
in his Edicts and C. CVRIO the Father in his Orations. CICERO likewise seems
to signify as much in a certain Epistle unto AXIVS wherein he reports that
CAESAR established in his Consulship that Kingdom and royal government, which
he plotted and thought upon when he was Aedile. TANVSIVS writes farther, that
CRASSVS either repenting himself, or else upon fear, was not present nor kept
the day appointed for the said massacre* and therefore CAESAR neither gave that
signal which by agreement he should have given. Now agreed it was as CVRIO
says, that he should let his gown fall from his shoulders. The same CVRIO yea
and M. ARTORIVS NASO do write, that he conspired also with CN. PISO anoble
young Gentleman, who being in suspicion for a conspiracy within the City, had
the Province of Spain extraordinarily and without his own suite bestowed upon
him: and complotted it was, that both he in foreign parts abroad * Who was

plays: wherein if the number of Images, Statues, and painted Tables fell out
to be greater than was needful, part of that furniture and provision might be
set forth to the view of all men. As for the chasing and baiting of wild
beasts, the Stage plays and solemn sights, he exhibited the^ both jointly
with his companion in Office, and also severally by himself. Whereby it came
to pass, that howsoever the charges of these Solemnities were borne in commune
by them both, yet he alone went away with all the honor and thank thereof:
Neither did M. BIBVLVS his Colleague dissimule the matter, but utter as much,
when he said that the same befell unto him which unto POLLVX: For like as

he did) such a sort of Fencers from all parts out of every School, and putting
his adversaries of the other faction in great affright thereby, he gave
occasion unto the State to provide by a special Act in that behalf, For a
certain set number of Sworde-plaiers, above which no man might retain any at

at the point to yield unto him. And yet for all this, he ceased not to hinder
their proceedings, until such time as a troop of Roman Knights, who stood
round about the place in Arms for Of Consul and Senate
guard and defense, threatened to dispatch him out of the way, in case he

part good with them drawing in one line, as they did, whom he saw in great
frequencie to run by heaps together, so fully bent to ma^e resistance, that
presently they left their officious attendance upon the new Consuls, he gave
over this action.

BUT, whereas CECILIVS METELLVS Surnamed Nepos (as Va^erius witnesses) for his

a Tribune of the Commons, proposed 16
most turbulent and seditious Laws, malgre his Colleagues with all their
opposition, he showed himself a stout ab better and maintainer of him: most
stiffly bearing him out in the cause, so long until both of them were by an
injunction and decree of the Senators remooved from the administration of the
Common wealth. Howbeit presuming nevertheless to continue in his magistracy,
and to execute his jurisdiction, when he understood once that some were ready
to prohibit him by force and Arms, he sent away his Sergeants, cast off his
( e) embrodered purple Robe, and retired priv^ly to his own house, minding
there to keep himself quiet in regard of the troublesome time. And when two
days after, the multitude flocked unto him willingly and of their own accord,
promising after a very tumultuous manner their help and assistance in the
recoverie of his former place and dignity, he repressed them. Which thing
happening thus beyond all expectation, The Senate which was hastily met
together about that riot and uprore, gave him hearty thanks; and that by the
principal and noblest personages among them, sent for him into the ( f) Curia,
and after they had in most honorable terms commended him, they restored him
fully to his Office, and reversed their former Decree.

HE fell again into another new trouble and danger, being called into 17.

who appeached him; and also in the Senate* by P. CVRIVS: unto whom for that he
detected first, the plots and designments of the Conspiratours, were rewards
appointed by the State. CVRIVS deposed that he knew so much by CATTILINE: and
VETTIVS promised to bring forth even his own handwriting which he gave unto
CATILINE: But this was such an indignity as CAESAR in no wise thought
tolerable; whereupon, craving the testimony of CICERO by which he proved,
that himself merely of his own accord had given some information unto him of
the said Conspiracy, ^e prevailed so much that CVRIVS went without those
rewards. As for VETTIVS, after his goods were arrested and stresses taken, his
household stuff rifled, himself evil entreated, beaten, and in the open
assembly of the multitude even before the ROSTRA wel-neere pulled in pieces,
him he clapped up in prison. After the same sort he served NOVIVS the Questour,
because he suffered him, ( g) a superior Magistrate of State, to be accused
and defamed in his house.

Ex praetura whereby it appears he was Praetor Viba^.
AFTER this Pretourship of his, having the Government of the farther 18.
Province in Spain allotted unto him, he took order with his Creditours
(that A. V. C. 69^.
were in hand to stay him) by the means of certain ( a) sureties who came in
and undertook for him: and before the Governors of the Provinces were
disposed-of by the State, with Commissions sealed for their jurisdiction and
other affairs, with allowance and furniture also set out for them accordingly,
he contrary to all right and custom put himself in his journey: were it for
fear of some judicial proceeding intended against him whiles he was a private
person, or because he might more speedily succor the Allies of the Romans,
who craved help, it is uncertain. Well, when he had settled the Province in
peace, he made as great have to be gone* and not expecting a Successor he
departed, as well to ride in Triumph as to take upon him the Consulship. But

triumph.

OF the two Competitours with him for the Consulship, to wit, L. LVCEIVS 19
and M. BIBVLVS, he made choice of LVCEIVS to be his Companion in Office; upon
this compact and condition, That since he was a man not so gracious, but
better monied than himself, he should of his own purse pronounce in the name
of both, and promise to deal moneys among the Centuries. Which devise being

Magistrate, and having a colleague ready at his beck to agree and consent with
him, he would both dare and do any thing; persuaded with BIBVLVS to make
promise of as great a Donation as the other did: and the most part of them
contributed their moneys thereunto. Yea, CATO himself verily was not against
it, but said, This Largess stood with the good of the weal public.
Hereupon created Consul he was with BIBVLVS. For the same cause, the said
Nobles and principal persons of the City gave order, that the Consuls for
this year following, should have ( b) the Provinces and Commissions of least
affair and importance, to wit, the looking unto Forests and Woods, unto Lanes
and Paths. CAESAR taking this wrong and disgrace most to the heart, made court
all that ever he could unto CN. POMPEIVS, who had taken offense against the
Senators, for that having vanquished K MITHRIDATES, his Acts and Decrees were
no sooner ratified and confirmed. He reconciled also unto POMPEIVS, M. CRASSVS,
an old enemy ever since that Consulship, which they bare together with
exceeding much jarring and disagreement: He entered likewise into a Society
with them both, upon this contract, That nothing should be done or pass in the
administration of the Commonweal, that displeased any of them three.

WHEN he was entered into this Honorable place of Consulship; he (first 20
of all that ever were) ordained, That all Acts, as well of Senate as People
should A. V. C. 695.

likewise he gave and granted, according as every man's mind and desire stood
thereto, and no man gaine-said him: but, went any about to thwart him, he was
soon frighted away. M. CATO, when he seemed to interrupt and stop his
proceedings, he caused to be haled violently out of the Senate house by an
Officer, and committed to prison. As L. LVCVLLVS stoutly withstood his doings,
he put him into so great a fear of sundry Actions and criminations, that he
was glad to come and fall down before him at his knees. When CICERO pleading

that he had gotten now what he desired in despite of his adversaries, and full

Questour ( a) for to prejudice him, was drawn into trouble and indicted upon
certain crimes. Within a while himself also was brought judicially to his
trial, and accused by L. ANTISTIVS a Tribune of the COMMONS: but by appealing
unto the College of the Tribunes, he prevailed through their favor thus much
(in regard of his absence about the affairs of Commonweal) that he should
not be liable to the accusation. For his better security therefore against
future times, he travailed much to obligue and make beholden unto him the
Magistrates every year: and of those Competitours who sued for any honorable

require of some an oath, yea, and a bill of their own hands.

BUT when L. DOMITIVS a ( a) Candidate for the Consulship threatened openly, 24.

he was Pretour, yea, and take from him his Armies, he made means to draw
CRASSVS and POMPEIVS unto Luca a City within his Province: with whom he dealt
effectually, that for to give DOMITIVS the repuise, they should both sue for
themselves to be Consuls the second time, and also labor that his government
might be prorogued or continued for five years longer; and he effected both.
Upon this confidence he presumed to assume unto those Legions which he had
received from the State, others beside, maintained partly at the Cities
charges, and in part with his own private purse. And one Legion above the
rest, enrolled from out of the Countries beyond the Alps, he termed by a
French word, For named it was The bird Galerita or Cassita, so called of a
crest, upon the head. This Legion it should seem ware P^umes of feathers in

after the Roman fashion, he afterward enfranchized throughout and made free

were of opinion, that he should be delivered unto the enemies hands. But by
reason that his affairs sped well and had good success, he obtained in
regard thereof solemn Supplications both oftener, and to hold more days than
ever any man did (before himself.)

DVRING the time of his (provincial) government, which continued nine 25.
years space, these, in manner, were the Acts which he performed. All that
part of Gaul, which from the Forest and Mountain Pyrenaeus, the Alps, and
the hill Gebena, is enclosed within the Rivers Rhene and Rhosne, containing in
circuit 3200. miles, not accounting the associate Cities and States well of the
people of Rome, he reduced into the form of a Province, and imposed upon them
a payment of tribute yearly. The Germans inhabiting beyond the Rhene, he of
all the Romans first assailed by means of a bridge which he built over the
said River, and those he grievously plagued and gave them many great
overthrowes. He set upon the Britains also, a people before time unknown,
whom he vanquished and compelled both to pay money, and also to deliver
hostages. In so many prosperous battles and fortunate exploits, he tasted of
adverse fortune thrice only and no more: once in Britain, when his Fleet had
like to have been lost and cast away in a violent tempest: a second time in
Gaul, where a Legion of his was discomfited and put to flight, near unto
Gergov^a: and last of all, in the marches of Germany, when TITVRIVS and
AVRVNCVLEIVS his Lievtenants were forlayed by an ambush and put to the sword.

WITHIN the compass of which very same time, he lost by death, first, his 26

astomed at the murder of CLODIVS, By Milo^
when the Senate thought good there should be but one Consul created, namely
CN. POMPEIVS, he dealt with the Tribunes of the Commons (who intended that he
should be the Colleague in Office with POMPEIVS) to propose this rather unto
the People, That they would grant leave unto him in his absence, whenever the
term of his government drew toward an end, to sue for his second Consulship:
because he might not be constrained upon that occasion, and whiles the war
was yet unfinished, to depart out of his Province. Which when he had once
obtained at their hands, reaching now at higher matters, and full of hopes,
there was no kind of largess, no manner of dutiful Office either in public
to the whole City, or privately unto any person that he omitted and left
undone. His FORVM or stately Hall he began to build with the money raised of
the spoils gotten in wars: the very plot of ground whereon it should stand,
cost him That is, a hundred millians of Sesterces, and 20, as P^me writes, lib

Feast unto the people, in the honor and memorial of his Daughter, a thing
that never any man did before him. And to cause an expectation of these
solemnities in the highest degree, the viands and whatsoever pertained unto the
feast, albeit he had agreed with B^tchers and Victualers for the same at a
certain price, he provided nevertheless by his Domesticatim.
houshold-servants. All the notable and well known sword players, when and
wheresoever they fought so, as upon the mislike and displeasure of the
beholders they were in danger to be killed in the place at their commandment,
he took order and charged they should be had away by force and reserved for
himself. As for new-Fencers and young beginners, he trained them neither in
any public School, nor under professed Mrs: of that Faculty, but at home in
private houses, by Gentlemen of Rome, yea, and Senators also, such as were
skilful^ in their weapon and in feats of Arms praying and beseeching them
earnestly (as appears in his Epistles unto them) to take the charge of every
one severally, and to have a special care to instruct each one, and give them
rules in their exercises. The legionarie Soldiers pay in money he doubled for
ever. And so often as there was plenty of corn, he gave them their allowance
of it without stint and measure and other-while he bestowed upon every one a
slave or bondservant, yea and possessions by the poll.

as he was to Octavius A^gustus, the Emperor.
Niece wedded unto C. MARCELLVS, he affianced and made sure unto him: but
withal, he craved his daughter to wife, promised in marriage before unto
FAUSTUS SULLA. Having thus obligued and brought to his devotion all those about
him, yea, and the greater number of Senators, by crediting out his money unto
them, either gratis, or upon a slight consideration: those also of other sorts
and degrees, either invited kindly by himself, or resorting unto him of their
own accord, he gratified with a most magnificent and bounteous ( a)
congiarie. The freed men besides, yea, and the Servants and Pages belonging to

Lord and Master, tasted of his liberality. Moreover, there was not a man sued
in Court judicially and in danger of the Law; there was not any deeply engaged
and endebted unto their Creditours; there were no prodigal young
spend-thrifts, but he was their only supporter, and most ready at all assaies
to help them: unless they were those that either had committed such grievous
crimes, or were so low brought, or had been so excessive in riot, as that they
could not possibly be relieved by him. For such as these, he would say in
plain terms and openly, there was no other remedy but civil war.

No less careful and studious was he to al^ure unto him the hearts of Kings,
28
yea, and whole Provinces throughout the world: unto some, offering in free
gift the deliverie of Captives and prisoners by thousands at a time: unto
others, sending aid secretly and underhand without authority or commission
of Senate and people, whether and as often as they would: and more than this,
adorning with goodly building and excellent pieces of work the mightiest Cities
of Italy, Gaul, Spain, yea, and of Asia and Greece. This he did so long,
until all men now were astonished thereat: and when they cast with themselves
whereto this might tend, at last M. CLAUDIUS MARCELLVS the Consul, after a
preface and preamble A. V. C. 703.
made to his Edict, namely, That he would speak as touching the maine point of
the Commonweal, proposed unto the Senate, That for as much as the war was
now ended, and peace abroad established, there might be one sent to succeed
him, before his time was fully expired; also, That the victorious Army ought
of right to be dismissed and have their discharge from warfare: Item, that in
the High Court and assembly for the Consuls election his name should not be
propounded, considering POMPEIVS afterward had anulled ^i plebis^ito.
that Act of the people (by virtue whereof it was granted that he might be
chosen Consul in his absence.) Now it had fallen out so, that he making a Law
as touching the right of Magistrates, in that Chapter and branch thereof,
wherein he disabled those who were absent for being capable of honors and
dignities, forgot to except CAESAR: and soon after, when the said Law was once
engrossed and engraven in brass, and so laid up in the Treasury, corrected
his error and oversight. Neither was MARCELLVS content to deprive CAESAR of his
Provinces, and to put him by the privilege of a former Act passed in especial
favor of him, but he made a motion moreover, that those inhabitants, whom by
the Law Vatinia CAESAR had planted in the Colonie of Novocomum, should leese
the freedom which they had, as Citizens of Rome: For that this prerogative of
theirs had been granted by ambitious means, and beyond that prescript number
which was appointed and warranted by the Decree in that behalf.

CAESAR highly displeased and troubled at these proceedings, and judging it,
(as he was heard by report many times to give out) an harder matter for him a 29
principal man of the City, to be deposed and thrust down from the highest
and first place of degree into the second, than from the second into the lowest
and last of all) withstood him with all his might and power, partly by the
opposition and negative voice of the Tribunes, and in part by SERVIUS SULPITIUS
A. V. C. 904.
the other Consul. Also in the year following when C. MARCELLUS who succeeded
his cosen GERMAIN by the fathers side MARCUS, in the co^sulship* assaied to
bring the same about, he bribed and made sure unto him, with a mighty sum of
money, AEMILIUS PAULUS, companion with him in office, and C. CURIO a most
violent Tribune* to stick unto him, and defend his honor. But seeing all
things carried still against him more obstinately than before, and the new
Consuls elect take the contrary side and bent another way, he wrote unto the
Senate, and by his letters humbly besought them, not to suffer the benefit
granted unto him by the people to be taken from him: or if they did, yet to
give order that other Generals like wise as well as he, might leave their
Armies: presuming confidently, as men think, upon this, himself should be
able whensoever he pleased to assemble together his soldiers more easily the^
POMPEIUSTO levy new. But with his adversaries he would have treated by way of
Capitulation in these terms, that after he had discharged and sent away 8.
Legions, and given over the province of Gaul beyond the Alps, he might be
allowed 2. legio^s with the province on this side the Alps: or if not so, yet
atleast wise one, together with ILLYRICUM, until such time as he were created
co^sul.

But perceiving that the Senate came not between nor interposed their
authority to stop the course intended against him, and his adversaries denied
flatly to admit all manner of capitulating and composition concerning the
commonwealth, he passed into the hither part of Gaul, and having kept the
Assizes there and executed his provincial jurisdiction stayed at Rauenna, with
full resolution to be revenged by open war, in case there had passed from the
Senate, any sharp and cruel decree, touching the Tribunes of the Commons
opposing themselves in his behalf, and quarrel: And verily this was the
color and occasion which he pretended of civil war: yet men think there
were some other causes and motives thereto. Cn. POMPEIUS was wont to give out
that for as much as CAESAR was not able of himself and with his own private
wealth, either to consummate and finish those stately works and aedifices
which he had begun, or to satisfy the expectation of the people which he had
raised and wrought of his coming, therefore he intended to trouble the state
and set all on a garboyle. Others say, that he feared least he should be
compelled to give an accoumpt of those things which in his first Consulship he
had done against the sacred Auspices, the laws, and prohibitions of the
Tribunes (in the name of the people) considering that M. CATO had threatened and
professed eftsoons, and not without an oath, that no sooner should he and his
army be parted, but he would judicially call his name in question and bring
him to his answer: Also for that it was commonly spoken abroad that if he
returned ones in quality of a private person, he should after the example of
MILO plead before the judges, with a guard of armed men about the Court and
Tribunal. And this seems to be more probable by that which ASINIUS POLLIO
writes, who reports, that in the battle of Pharsalia, when he beheld his
adversaries before his face, slain and put to flight, he uttered this speech
word for word. Lo, this was their own doing: this would they needs have, And
I CAIUS CEASAR after so many worthy exploites achieved should have been a
condemned man, had I not craved help of mine army. Some are of opinion, that
being so long inured and acquainted with sovereign command, and weighing his
own puissance and the power of his enemies, in balla^ce one against the other,
took the occasion and opportunity to usurp that absolute dominion, which in
the uerie prime of his years he aspired unto; and of this mind, it seems
CICERO was, who in his 3. book of duties writes, that CEASAR had always in
his mouth, these verses of EURIPIDES

(...)
(...).
Which CICERO himself translated thus.

Nam si violandum est ius, imperij gratia
Violandum est, alijs reb^s pietatem colas.
For if thou must do wrong by breach,
Of laws, of right and equity,
It Is best thereby a Crown to reach,
In all things else keep piety.
When word therefore was brought unto him, that the Tribunes inhibition 31
and negative voice was put down, and themselves departed out of the City: A*
V* C* 705,
having immediately sent before certain Cohorts privily, because no suspicion
might arise, he dissimuled the matter, and was present in person to behold a
public Game, viewed, and considered the plotforme according to which he was
about to build a School of sword fencers, and according to his usual manner
gave himself to feast and banquet often. After this presently upon the
Sunsetting, he took up certain Mules from the next Bakersmil-house; set the^
in their geires to his wagon, and as closely as possibly he could with a small
retinewe and company about him put himself in his Journey; and when by reason
that the lights were gone out, he had lost his way, after he had wandered a long
time, at the length meeting with a guide by that time it was day, he passed on
foot through most narrow cross lanes and by-pathes until he recovered the
right way again. Now when he had ones overtaken his Cohorts, at the river
Rubicon, which was the utmost bound of his province, he rested and stood still
a little while* the^ casting in his mind, how great an enterprise he went in
hand with, he turned unto them that were next unto him and said. As yet my
masters we may well return back; but pass we once over this little bridge,
there will be no dealing but by force of arms and dint of sword.

As he thus stayed, and stood doubtful what to do, a strange sight he chanced
to see in this manner. All of a sudden their appeared unto him a certain man
of an extraordinary stature and shape withal, sitting hard by, and piping with
a reed. Now when beside the shepherds and herdmen many soldiers also from
their standing wards ran for to hear him, and among them the Trumpetters
likewise, he caught from on of the^ a Trum pet, leapt forth to the river, and
beginning with a mighty blast to sound the battle, kept on his pace to the
very bancke, on the otherside. Then CEASAR, Let us march on quoth he and go
whither the tokens of the Gods and the injurious dealings of our enemies call
us. The dice be thrown: I have set up my rest. Come what will of it.

And thus having conveyed his army over the river, he joined with the Tribunes
of the commons, who upon their expulsion out of the City were come unto him,
and in a full and frequent asse^blie, with shedding tears and re^ting his
garment down the breast, besought 3^
the faithful help and assistance of his soldiers. It is supposed also that
he promised unto every on of the^ a knights living: which happened upon a vain
and false persuasion, for when in his speech and exhortation unto the^, he
showed ever and a non the (ring*) finger of his left hand, and therewith
avouched and promised for the satisfaction and contentme^t of al those by whose
means he should maintain his honor and dignity, that he would willingly (
b) pluck the ring from off his own finger: those that stood hinmost in the
assembly, who might better see than hear him speak, took that for spoken which
they imagined by bare sight, and so the speech went for current, That he
promised them the dignity of wearing the ring (of gold) together with 400000
(sesterces.)

THE order* proceeding a final complement of those Acts, which from thence 34
forth he achieved, summarily goes in this manner. He seized into his hands
and held PICENUM, VMBRIA, and HETRURIA. L. DOMITIVS, who in a factious tumult
was nominated to be his successor, and kept CORFINIVM with a garrison, he
subdued and forced to yield: and when he had dismissed him, he marched along
the coast of the Adriatic That is Venus-gulfe.
sea, to Brundis, whether the Consuls and POMPEIVS were fled, intending with
all speed to cross the narrow Seas: whose passage after he had assaied by all
manner of lets to hinder and stop (but in vain) he turned his journey and took
the way directly to Rome. And when he had courteously moved the Senators to
give him meeting in the Senate house, there to treat and consult ^ T^
as touching the State of the Commonweal, he set upon the most puissant
forces of POMPEIVS, which were in Spain under the conduct of three
Lieutenants, M. PETREIVS L. AFFRANIVS and M. VARRO: having given out before
among his friends and openly professed, that he was going to an Army without a
( a) Captain; and would return from thence to a ( b) Captain without an
Army. And albeit the besieging of Massilia, which City in his journey
forward, had shut the gates against him, and exceeding scarcity of corn and
victuals was some impeachment and stay unto him, yet within a short time he
overcame and subdued all.

FROM hence having returned to the City (of Rome) again, and passed over into

months, and that within most mighty trenches and strong rampires, he
discomfited at the last in the Pharsalian battle and put him to flight: and
following him hotly in chase as he fled to Alexandria, so soon as he
understood that he was slain, and perceived likewise that King PTOLOMAEVS laid
wait for his own person also, he warred upon him* which, to say a truth, was a
most difficult and dangerous piece of work, by reason that he managed it,
neither in place indifferent, nor time convenient, but in the very Winter
season, and within the walls of a most wealthy and politic enemy, being
himself in distress and want of all things, and unprovided besides to fight.
Having achieved the victory, he granted the kingdom A. V. C. 707.
of Egypt unto CLEOPATRA and her younger brother, fearing to reduce it into
the form of a Province, least at any time, being governed under some L.
President of a more stirring spirit and violent nature than others, it might
give occasion and yield matter of rebellion. From Alexandria he went over into
Syria, and so from thence into Pontus, upon the urgent news as touching
PHARNACES; Whom, notwithstanding he was the son of that great MITHRIDATES,
and taking the opportunity of the troubles and civil war among the Romans,
made war, yea, and now bare himself presumptuous and overbold for his
manifold victories and great success, yet within 5 days after his arrival
thither, and 4. hours after he came into sight of the enemy, he vanquished
and subdued in one only battle: eft-soones and oftentimes recounting the
felicity of POMPEIVS, whose 708. A. V. C. 709.
hap it was, to win his principal name for warfare, of so ^owardly a kind of
enemies. After this, he defeited SCIPIO and IVBA, repairing the relics of
that side in Africa, and the children of POMPEIVS in Spain.

IN all the civil wars, he sustained no loss or overthrow but by his own
36
Lieutenants: of whom, C. CVRIO was slain in Afric: C. ANTONIUS yielded
himself into the hands of his enemies in Illyricum: P. DOLABELLA in the same
Illyricum lost his fleet, and CN. DOMITIVS his army in Pontus. Himself
fought his battles always most fortunatly, and never was so much as in any
hazard, save only twice: once before Dyrrachium, where being discomfited and
put to flight, when he saw that POMPEIVS followed not on in chase, he said of
him, That he knew not how to use a victory. A second time, in Spain, at the
last battle that ever he fought, what time, being in great despair, he was
of mind even to have killed himself.

HAVING finished all his wars, he rode in 5. triumphs: to wit, when he had 37
vanquished SCIPIO, 4. times in one and the same month, but certain days
between: A. V. C 708. 709.
and once again, after he had overcome the children of POMPEIVS. The first
and most excellent triumph that he solemnized, was that over Gaul: then
followed the Alexandrine; after it the Pontick; next thereunto the Affrican:
and last of all the Spanish: every one set out diversely, with variety of
Ordinance, provision and furniture. On the day of his Gauls triumph, as he
rode along the A Street in Rome.
Velabrum, he had like to have been shaken out of his Chariot, by reason that
the Axel-tree brake. He mounted up into the Capitol by torch-light, having
xl. Elephants on his right hand and left, bearing ( a) branches and
candlesticks. In his Pontick triumph, among the Pageants and shows of that
pomp, he caused to be carried before him the title and superscription of these
three words, Veni, vidi, vici, I came, I saw, I conquered: signifying, not the
acts achieved by war, as other * Sicut caet^ri.
Conquerours, but noting his expedition in despatching the war.

THROUGHOUT the Legions of old Soldiers, he gave in the name of pillage, 38
unto every footman (over and above the ( a) 2000. sestertij, which he had
paid at the beginning of the civil tumult) ( b) Or rather ^cena, that is,
20000.
4000. sestertij: and to the horsemen ( c) Rather quadrag^, that is 40000.
24000. a piece. He assigned lands also unto the^, but not lying all together,
because none of the owners should be thrust out (of their livings.) Among the
people (of Rome) beside x. modij of corn, and as many pints of oil, he
distributed and dealt 300 Sesterces also by the poll, which he had in times

made them a general great feast, and distributed a dole of raw flesh: yea,
and after his victory in Spain he gave them 2. dinners: For, deeming the
former of them to have been made niggardly and not beseeming his liberality,
he bestowed upon them 5. days after, another, and in most large and plenteous
manner.

39 HE exhibited shows of sundry sorts (as namely) a sword-fight of Fencers at
sharp: he set forth Stage Plays likewise in several quarters and ( a)
Regions of the City throughout, and those verily acted by Vi^eeratione^: which
as some think Porfi^, calls (...) and is expounded (...) whereupon the

Plaiers in all languages: Semblably, the solemn games ( b) Circenses, he
showed; and brought forth Champions also to perform their devoir, and
represented a naval-fight. At the said solemnity of sword-plaiers, there
fought to the uttrance in the Market place of Rome, FVRIVS LEPTINVS, descended
from the race of Pretours, and A. CALPENVS, one who had been sometime a
Senator, and a pleader of causes at the bar. There daunced the ( c) Pyrrhick
warlike dance, the children of the Princes and Potentates of Asia and
Bithynia. During the Stage plays aforesaid ( d) D. LABERIVS a Gentleman of
Rome acted his own Poem or Interlude: For which, being rewarded with 500.
thousand Sesterces, and a ring of gold, he passed directly from the Stage by
the ( e) Orchestra, to take up his place among the Knights in the 14. foremost
seats. At the Games Circenses, against which the Cirque was enlarged on both
sides and mo^ed round about, there drove the Steedes drawing Chariots four and
two together, yea and mounted the vaunting Horses from one to another, the
greatest gallants and bravest young Gentlemen of the Nobility. The ( f)
warlike Trojan Game was performed by a twofold troop of greater boys and
less. The hunting or baiting of wild beasts was presented five days
together. And the last day of all, there was a fight between two battles of
500. footmen, 20. Elephants, and 30. horsemen on a side, put to skirmish one
against the other. For, to the end that they might have more scope to bicker
together* the ( g) goales were taken up and removed: but in steed of them were
pitched two Or Tents*
Camps confronting one another. As for the ( h) Champions abovesaid, they
having a place for to exercise their feats of Activitie set out and built for
the present time, strove for the prize or best Game three days together in the
Region of Mars field. To set out the Naumachie or naval battle, there was a
place dug for a great poole, in the less ( i) Co^eta; wherein certain
galleys as well with two ranks of Oars as with three; the ships of Tyros also
and of Egypt encountered, being manned with a great number of fighting men. To
behold these sights and shows, such a number of people resorted from all
parts, as most of the strangers either within the streets of the City or in
the high ways without, were feign to abide within booths pitched of purpose:
yea, and oftentimes very many were in the press crowded and crushed to death;
among whom were two Senators.

TVRNIN^ after this to set the State of the Commonweal in good order, 40
he reformed the Calendar, which long since through the Prelates default, by
their liberty of interlacing (months and days) at their pleasure, was so
confused, that neither the feastivall holidaies of harvest fell out in Summer,
nor those of the vintage in Autumn. And he framed the whole year just unto
the course of the Sun, that it should contain 365. days; and by abolishing
the leap month, one ( a) day every fourth year might be inserted between.

Now to the end that the computation of the times to come, might from the
Calen^is Iauxarijs (...).

put two other months. So as, that year wherein all this was ordained, had 15.
months, reckoning the ordinary interlaced month, which by course and custom
fell just upon the said year.

HE made up the full ( a) number of the Senators, and chose unto that place 41

new ( b) Patritij. The number of Pretours, Aediles, Questors, and of other (
c) inferior Magistrates he augmented. Such as were displaced and put down by
virtue of the Censors Office, or otherwise by sentence of the Judges condemned
for unlawful briberie, and suing indirectly for any Office, he restored to
their former rooms. In the election of Magistrates he parted with the people
thus far forth; as (excepting the Competitours of the Consulship) for all the
number besides of Candidates, the one half should be declared those whom the
People were disposed to propound, the other half, such as himself would
nominate. Which nomination passed by certain bills sent about unto the Tribes,
in a brief kind of Writ after this manner: CAESAR DICTATOVR unto this or that
Tribe (greeting) I commend unto you, such an one and such an one, that by
virtue of your voices and suffrages they may have and hold the dignity they

of those who had been proscript and outlawed. He reduced all Judgments unto
two sorts of Judges, namely of the Knights degree and the Senators: As for the
Tribunes of the Treasury or chamber of the City, which had been the third, he

abolished. The general survay and numbering of the people he held, neither
after the accustomed ( d) manner, nor in the usual place, but street by
street, and that by the As who best knew the number of their tennants and
inhabitants in their houses.
Landlords and owners of messuages and tenements standing together: and
whereas 3020000 Citizens ( e) received allowance of corn from the State, he
brought and reduced them to the number of one hundred and fifty thousand. And
to the end that no new conventicles and riots at any time might arise about
this review, he ordained, That every year, in the place of those that were
deceased, the Pretour should make a new supply and choice by casting lots, out
of such as had not been reckoned and enrolled in the former survey.

MOREOVER, when as to the number of 80000. (Roman) Citizens were bestowed 42
in sundry Colonies beyond the Sea; he made a Law for the more frequent
inhabiting of the City (of Rome) thus exhausted and dispeopled; That no
Citizen above 20. years of age, and under 40. (unless he were a sworn ( f)
soldier to the State, and so bound by his oath) should remain out of Italy
above 3. years together: Item, That no Senators son, except he lodged
within the house or Pavilion, or belonged to the ( g) familiar trial of a
chief Magistrate, should travail (forth of Italy.) Item, That no Grasiars
should keep and retain fewer than a third part of free borne young men, among
the keepers of their cattle. All professors of physic at Rome, and teachers
of the liberal Arts, he enfranchized Citizens: that both they themselves might
more willingly dwell in the City, and others beside desire there to inhabit.
As touching money lent out; when he had quite put down the expectation of ( h)
cancelling debts, (at thing that was often Either by the Tribunes of the
Commons, or the debtors themselves.
moved) he decreed at length; That all debtours should satisfy their
Creditours in this manner: Namely by an estimate made of their possessions,
according to the worth and value as they purchased them before the civil
war, deducting out of the principal whatsoever had been paid or set down
in the Obligations for the use: by which condition, the third part wel-neare of
the money credited forth, was lost. All the Societies and Colleges, saving
those that were of ancient foundation, he dissolved. The penalties of heinous
crimes he augmented: And whereas the rich and wealthier sort fell to wickedness
so much the sooner, because they went In the free State before the Emperors,
Citizens of Rome might depart before sentence pronounced, and so avoid with
condemnation and loss of goods.
into banishment, and saved their whole patrimonies and estates: ( i)
parricides therefore and wilful murderers (as CICERO writes) he deprived of
all their goods; other manslaiers besides he fined with the loss of one half.

HE ministered Justice and decided matters in Law, most painfully and with
passing great 43
severitie. Such as were attaint and convict of ( a) extortion, he removed
even from their Senators place and degree. He brake the marriage of a man that
had been Pretour, marying a wife presently after two days that she was
divorced and went from a former husband, albeit there was no suspicion at all
of adultery and naughtiness. He ordained customs and imposts of foreign
merchandise. The use of Licters, likewise the wearing of purple Or scarlet in
grain.
clothes and of pearl he took away, saving only in certain persons and
ages, and upon special days. The Law Sumptuaria, ( b) to repress excessive
cost in fare, he executed most of any other: And for this purpose, he set
certain Watchmen and Warders in sundry places about the shambles and markets
where victuals were sold, to lay hold upon all cates and viands contrary to
the prescript rule of the Law in that behalf, and to bring the same unto him.
Otherwhiles also, he sent secretly his own Officers and Soldiers, to fetch
away such meats our of the very dining Parlors and banqueting rooms, even
when they were set upon the board, if happily they had any way escaped the hands
of the foresaid warders.

FOR, as concerning his purpose to adorn and beautify the City of Rome with
gallant 44
works, as also to maintain and amplify the Empire, he had more matters in
his head and greater every day than other. Principally his intent and meaning
was, to build so stately a temple in the honor of Mars, as the like was no
where to be seen; having filled up and laid level that huge pit, wherein he
had exhibited the show of a Naval battle: and also to erect an exceeding great
Theater, fast adjoining to the Mount Tarpei^s. Ite^, to reduce the whole corpse
of the civil Law to a certain mean and mediocrity: and out of that huge and
diffused number of Laws, to choose out the best and necessary points, and
those to bring into as few volumes as possibly might be. Item, to erect
publicly the greatest Libraries that he could, as well of Greek as Latin
Authors: committing unto ( a) M. VARRO the charge, both to provide the said
books, and also to digest and place them in order. Item to lay the Meeres and
Fennie Plashes POMPTINAE dry: to draw and let forth the lake Fucinus: to make
a cawsie or highway, from the Adriatic Sea, by the ridge or side of the
Apennine hill, as far as to the river Tibris, and to dig through the ( b)
Isthmus. Moreover, to bridle the Dakes who had invaded Pontus and Thracia: and
soon after, to make war upon the Parthians by the way of Armenia the less*
but not to give them battle before he had made ( c) trial of them. Amid these
purposes and designs, death prevented him. Concerning which, before I enter
into speech, it shall not be impertinent to deliver summarily those points
which concern the snape, feature, and proportion of his body: his habit and
apparel: his fashions and behavior: and withal, what may touch both his
civil and also his martial affairs.

OF stature he is reported to have been tall; of complexion white and clear;
45
with limbs well trussed and in good plight; somewhat full faced; his eyes
black, lively, and quick; also very healthful, saving that in his latter days
he was given to faint and swoune suddenly; yea, and as he dreamed, to start and
be affrighted: twice also in the midst of his martial Inter re^ gerenda^ vel
agendas, that is, cum acie^ ordinar^t, Plutarch. Whiles he was setting his
Army in battle ray.
affairs, he was surprised with the ( ^) falling sickness. About the trimming
of his body, he was Or fantastical.
overcurious: so as he would not only be notted and shaven very precisely,
but also have his hair plucked, in so much as some cast it in his teeth, and
twitted him therewith. Moreover, finding by experience, that the deformity of
his bald head was oftentimes subject to the scoffs and scorns of back-biters
and slaunderers, he took the same exceedingly to the heart: and therefore he
both had usually drawn down his hair that grew but thin, from the crown
toward his forehead: and also of all honors decreed unto him from the Senate
and People, he neither received nor used any more willingly, than the
privilege to wear continually the triumphant Laurel guirland. Men say also*
that in his apparel he was noted His attire different from others, or of a new
fashion which the Greeks call (...).
for singularity, as who used to go in his Senators purple studded robe,
trimmed with a jagge or frindge at the sleeve hand: and the same so, as he
never was but girt over it, and that very slack and loose: whereupon, arose
(for certain) that saying of SVLLA, who admonished the Nobles oftentimes, To
beware of the boy that went girded so dissolutely.

HE dwelt at first in the A Street i^ Rome much frequented.
Suburra; but after he was high priest, in the street 46
Sacra, in an edifice of the Cities. Many have written, that he was exceedingly
addicted to neatness in his house, and sumptuous fare at his Table. The Manor
house which he founded out of the very ground, and with great charges finished
in the territory Nemorensis, because it was not wholly answerable to his
mind, he demolished and pulled quite down: although as yet he was but of
mean estate and deeply endebted. Finally, this speech goes of him, That in
his expeditions he carried about with him The paving tiles of marble etc,
whereof such floores are made.
pavements of checker work made of quarrels square cut, so as they might be
taken asunder, and set again together.

HE made a voyage (as they say) into Britain, in hope of pearls: and 47
otherwhiles, in comparing their bigness, would with his own hand peise them
to find their weight. For to get and buy up precious stones, engraved and
chased pieces, Images, and painted Tables of antique work, he was ever most
eager and sharp set. Slaves likewise, if they were any thing fresh and new
come, trimly set out with all, and fine, he procured at an exceeding price,
such as himself also was ashamed of: so as he forbad expressly the same should
be brought in any of his reckonings and accoumpts.

IT is reported of him, that in all the Provinces which he governed, he
feasted 48
continually, and furnished two Halls or dining chambers ordinarily; the one,
wherein either Thus Turnebus expounds it: But it may be meant of the meaner
^ort of his Cohor, prae oria, who were Sag^ or pall at^: to put a difference
between them and the persons of better qua ^ty, who were Toga^.
Gauls in their warlike habit, or Greeks in their cloakes; the other, in
which the gown'd Romans, together with the more noble and honorable
personages of the Provinces sat. The domestical Discipline of his house he
kept so duly, so precisely, and with such severity, in small matters as well as
greater; that he bound with fetters and yrons his Baker for serving up
secretly unto his guests other bread than to himself: And a freed man of his
own (whom otherwise he did set very great store by) he put to death, for
dishonouring by adultery a Roman Gentleman's wife, albeit no man made
complaint thereof.

HIS good name for continency and clean life, nothing verily blemished, 49
save only the aboade and inward familiarity with NICOMEDES: but a foul
stain that was, which followed him with shame for ever; yea, and ministered
taunting and reproachful matter unto every man. I omit the notorious verses of
CALVUS LICINIVS.

Look what it was that Bithyne Land had ever more or less;
And he that CAESAR did abuse, in filthy wantonness.
I let pass the invectives and accusatorie actions of DOLABELLA and CVRIO the
Father: In which, DOLABELLA for his part, terms him the Kings Concubine in
the Queens place, and the inner room of his Licter: and CVRIO* names him
NICOMEEDES his Stabul^*
filth and harlot, yea and the Bithynian Brothel house. Ioverpasse likewise
those Edicts of BIBVLVS, wherein he published his colleague, and made him
known, by the name of the Bithynian Queen: saying moreover, That before, he
had loved the King, and now cast a fancy to the Kingdom At which very time,
as M. BRUTUS makes report, there was one OCTAVIUS also, a man upon
distemperature of his brain given to jest and scoff over broadly, who in a
most frequent assembly, after he had called POMPEIVS, King, saluted him by the
name of Queen: C. MEMMIVS likewise laid in his dish, that he stood with the
rest of the stale Catamites as Cup Bearer, to serve NICOMEDES with wine at a
full feast, where sat at the Table diverse Merchants and Occupiers, Citizens of
Rome, whose names he puts down. But CICERO not contented herewith, that in
certain Epistles he had written, how by the Guard or Pensioners of the said
King being Deductum, or E^uctum, that is, brought out of his own bed than b^

conveied into his bedchamber, he lay down upon a bed of gold, arraied in
purple: and so the flower of youth and maidenhead of him, who was descended
from ( a) Venus, became d^filed and desteind in Bithynia. One time also, as
CAESAR in the Senate house pleaded to the cause and in the behalf of NYSA
NICOMEDES his daughter, and therewith rehearsed up the gracious favors that
the King had done unto him, Let be (quoth he) these matters I pray you, and
away with them, since it is well known, both what he bestowed upon you, and
also what you gave to him. Finally, in the Triumph over Gaul, his Soldiers
among other Sonnets (such as they use to chaunt merrily when they follow the
(triumphant) Chariot) pronounced also these verses so commonly divulged.

Gallias Caesar subegit, Nicomedes Caesarem,
Ecce Caesar nunc triumphat, qui subegit Gallias;
Nicomedes non triumphat, qui (b) subegit Caesarem.
CAESAR did subdue the Gauls, and him has NICOMEDE.
Behold, now CAESAR does triumph, who did the Gauls subdue:
But NICOMEDE triumphs not who CAESAR has subdued.
AN opinion there is constantly received; That he was given to carnal
pleasures, 50
and that way spent much: also, that he dishonored many Dames, and those of
noble houses: by name among others, POSTUMIA the wife of SERVIVS SVLPITIVS;
LOLLIA, wife to A. GABINIVS; TERTVLLA, M. CRASSVS his wife, and MVTIA the wife
of CN. POMPEIVS. For, certain it is, that not only the Curiones, both Father
and Son, but many others also reproached POMPEIVS; That for whose cause, he
had put away his own wife after she had borne him three children, and whom he
was wont with a deep sigh and groan to call That is, Adulterer: For that

For, with her, he both sat up many times and feasted all night long even
until the break of day; and also in the same Barge or Galley called

he knew him to be his son: averring withal, That C. MATIVS, CAIUS OPPIVS and
the rest of CAESAR'S friends knew as much. Of who^, C. OPPIVS (as if the thing
were so pregnant, that it required some Apology and defense) put forth a book
entitled thus: TAAT HE WAS NOT CAESAR'S SON, WHOM CLEOPATRA FATHERED UPON
HIM. HELVIUS CINNA, a Tribune of the Com confessed unto many persons, That he
had a Law drawn out in writing and in readiness, which CAESAR being absent
himself commanded him to propose, to this effect, That it might be lawful
for him to marry Quas et quot, ducere ^llet, even an Alien.

doubt how infamous he was, both for ( b) uncleanness of body against kind,
and also for adulteries, CVRIO the Father in a certain Oration calls him a
woman for all men, and a man for all women.

THAT he was a most sparie drinker of wine, his very enemies would never deny.

Whereupon arose this Apophthegm of M. CATO, That of all that ever were, CAESAR
alone came sober to the overthrow of the State. For, about his food and diet
C. OPPIUS shows he was so indifferent and without curiosity, * Conditum
^leum penult. cor. or conditum product^ est ^nguentum, an ointment.
that when upon a time his Host set before him upon the board old rank oil in
steed of green, sweet, and fresh, so that other guests refused it, he only
(by his saying) fell to it and eat thereof the more liberally; because he
would not be thought to blame his Or friend.
Host either for negligence or rusticitie.

FROM other men's goods he held not his hands, neither when he had the command 54
of Armies abroad, nor when he was in place of magistracy at home: For, in
Spain (as some have recorded) he took money of the Tubero.

them to the sack, more often for booty sake and pillage, than for any

solemn shows exhibited to the people.

IN eloquence and warlike feats together, he either equalled or excelled the
glory of the very best. After his accusation of DOLOBELLA, he was no doubt 55
ranged in the rank of the principal Advocates at Law. Certes, CICERO in his
Catalogue of Orators to BRUTUS, says; He cannot see any one, unto whom
CAESAR might give place; affirming withal, That he holds an elegant and
gay, a stately also, and in some sort a generous and Gentleman like kind of
pleading: And unto CORNELIUS NEPOS, thus wrote he of the same CAESAR. What
should a man say more? which of all there Orators that practiced nothing else
but Oratorie, will you prefer before this CAESAR? who is there in sentences
either quicker or coming thicker? who for words, yielded more gallant or more
elegant? He seems whiles he was yet but young, to have followed that form
of eloquence only, which STRABO CAESAR professed: out of whose Oration also
entitled, Pro Sardis; he transferred some sentences, word for word, into his
own; called Diuinatio. It is said, that in his Take it ge^ ^rally for the
whole Actio^
Pronunciation, he used an high and shrill voice; an ardent motion; and earnest
gesture, not without a lovely grace. Some Orations he left behind him (in
writing.) Among which certain go under his name, but untruly as namely that
pro; Q. MET^LLO: which AUGUSTUS deemeth (and not without good cause) to to have
been written rather by Notaries, who either took not his words aright, or
wrote not so fast, as he delivered them, than penned by himself. For in
certain copies I find that it had not so much as this Inscription, Pro
METELLO: but Which he wrote for, or (...) Metellu^.

person of CAESAR, clearing METELLVS and himself, against the criminations and

as any time to make a speech; the enemies ran upon him and charged so suddenly.

He left Commentaries also of his own Acts, to wit, as touching the
Ga^lewarre, and the Civil war with POMPEIUS. For, of the ALEXANDRIN^,
AFRICAN, and Spanishwarres, who was the writer it is uncertain: Whilst some
think it was OPPIVS; others, HIRTIVS; who also made up and finished the last
of the Gaule-war, which was unperfect. As concerning those Commentaries
aforesaid of CAESAR, CICERO in the Ad (...).

foolish folk he did some pleasure, who are willing to curle and frizle the
same with their crisping pins, but surely the wiser sort he skared altogether
from writing. Of the same Commentaries, HIRTIVS gives this report, They are
quoth he, in the judgment of all men so approved, that it seems he has
prevented writers, and not given them any help. And yet, our admiration of
this matter is more than all men's beside. For, whereas others do know only
how well and purely they were penned, we note also with what facility and
expedition he wrote them. POLLIO ASINIUS thinks * Asi^ Poll^.
they were compiled with small care and diligence: with as little regard also of
sound truth: seeing that CAESAR received hand over head, and believed most
things lightly: namely such as were by others achieved; and even those Acts
which himself exploited either of purpose or for default of memory he put
down wrong: He supposes also that he meant to have written the same a new and

news brought unto him, that his Camp was beleagured in German; passed
through his enemies Corpse de guard in French habit, and so came unto his own
men. From Brindis to Dirrhachium, he sailed over Sea in Hieme, or in a
tempestuous and stormy season, as Virgil and others, use the word*
winter, between ij. Fleetes of the enemies riding opposite one to the other:
and whiles his own forces which he had commanded to follow straight after him,
lingered still behind; having sent messengers oftentimes to call them away but
all in vain, at last himself secretly in the night went abourd into a very
small botume, with his head hooded: and neither discovered who he was, nor
suffered the pillot to give way unto the Tempest* that came full affront the

not often set fields appointed before hand* but upon the present 60
occasion offered; Many times he struck a battle immediately after his iourny,
otherwhiles in most foul and stormy wether, when no man ever thought he would
once stir. Neither held he off, and detracted fight, but in his latter daves:
being then of this opinion that the oftener he had gotten victory, the less
he was to venture and make trial of fortune; Also, That a victory could gain
him nothing so much, as some disasterous calamity might take from him. No
enemy put he ever to flight, but he discamped him and drove him out of the
field. By this means he gave them whom he had once discomfited, no time to be
think themselves. In any doubtful and dangerous service, his manner was to
send away the horses, and his own with the first: to the end, that when all
means of flight were gone, they might of necessity be forced the rather to
stand to it and abide to the last.

The horse he used to ride upon was strangly marked, with feet resembling 61
very near a man's, and the houes cloven like toes, which horse was foaled
about home: and when the Soothsayers of their learning had pronounced; that he
presaged unto his owner the Empire of the whole world, very careful he was
to rear him and nourish him. Now when as the beast would abide no man else to
ride him, himself was he that backed him first. The full pourtraict and
proportion of which horse, he dedicated also afterward before the Temple of
Venus (a) Genitrix.

Many a time himself alone renewed the battle when it was discomfited, 62
standing in their way that fled and holding the^ one by one back: yea and by
wreathing their throats he turned them again upon the enemies. Thus dealt he I
say with his own soldiers, when they were many times verily so fearfully
maskared, that a Aquilifer. Some read Aquilifer^, as if Caesar threatened the

At Alexandria being busy about the assault and winning of a bridge where 64
by a sudden sallie of the enemies he was driven, to take a boat, and many
besides made have to get into the same, he lept into the sea, and by swimming
almost a quarter of a mile recovered clear the next ship: bearing up his left
hand all the while, for fear the writings which he held therein should take
wet, and drawing his rich coat ( a) armor after him by the teeth, because the
enemy should not have it as a spoil.

used them all with like severitie: with like indulgence also and sufferance.
For he awed and chastised them not in all places nor at all times: but only
when the enemy was very near at hand: and then especially was he most severe,
and precise in exacting and executing of discipline: in so much as he would
not give the^ warning of the time; either of journey or of battle, but kept
the^ ready, intentive and pressed to be ^ed forth upon a sudden, every minute
of an hour, whether soever he would; this did he also many times without any
cause, especially upon rainie days and festivals. And admonishing his soldiers
ever and among, to observe and have an ey unto him, he would suddenly in the
daytime or by night, withdraw himself out of the way yea and stretch out his

As touching his soldiers trespasses and delinquencies, he neither observed and

proportion. But as he made straight inquisition after those who traitorously
forsook their colors, and were mutinous, and proceeded against them with
rigor so, at others he would wink. Sometimes also, after a great battle and
victory obtained, he released them all of military duties; permitting them in
all licentiousness to roist and royot wantonly here and there: being wont to
give it out, That his soldiers (perfumed though they were with Odours: and
besmeered with sweet oils) could fight valiantly. Neither called he them in
his public oration, plain soldiers, but by a more pleasing name,
Fellowsoldiers. Furthermore he maintained them so trim and brave, that he
stuck not to set them out in polished armor, damasked with filuer and gold:
as well for goodly show, as because they should in battle take better hold
and keep the same more surely for fear of damage and loss. Moreover he loved
them so affectionatley, that when he heard of And ^he Legro^s (...) him A. V.

valorous,

When he was entered into the Civil war, the Centurions of every Legion 68
presented unto him one horseman a piece, provided out of their own ( a)
private stock; and generally all his soldiers offered their service freely,
with out allowance of corn or wages out of his purse: considering that the
welthier sort had taken upon them the finding and maintenance of the poorer.
Neither all that long time of solderie, was their any of them that once
revolted from him; and very many being taken prisoners (by the enemies) and
having life granted unto them upon condition, they would serve as soldiers

war, not only whilst they were beseeged, but also when themselves beleagured

kept it still. ACILIUS in a fight at sea before, MASSILIA, after his right hand

following herein that memorable example of CYNECIRVS among the Greeks, leapt
notwithstanding into the said ship, shouing and driving before him with the
bosse and pike of his buckler those that he met in his way:

In ten years space during the Gaule-warre, they never so much as once

In the Civil wars some times they did: yet so, as they were soon reclaimed
and came again into order: not so much by the remiss indulgence as the
authority of their Captain* For, never would he yield one jot unto them in
these their seditious tumults nay, he always withstood and crossed them: And

As for the soldiers of the tent Legion, when as in Rome they earnestly called
70
for their discharge from warfare, and required their rewards even with mighty
threats, and that to the exceeding danger of the whole City at what time also,
the war was very hot in Afrike, he neither would admit the^ into his
presence, nor yet dismiss the^ albeit his friends seemed to scare him from
taking that course: but with one only word, whereby he named them ( a)
Quirites, instead of Milites, he did so gently turn and wind, yea and bring
them to his bent, that forthwith they made answer. They would be his souldies
still: and so of their own accord followed him into Africa, notwithstanding he
refused their service, And yet for all this, he ammerced and fined the most
mutinous sort of them with the loss of a third part, both of the pillage and
also of the Lands appointed for them.

In affectionate love and faithful protection of his dependants, he was not 71
wanting in his very youth. When he had upon a time defended MASINTHA a noble
young Gentleman against King Who laid claim unto Masintha as his Tributa^ie.
HIEMPSAL, so earnestly, that in the debate and altercatio^ between them he
flew upon IVBA the Kings son and caught him by the ( a) beard: after that the
said MASINTHA was pronounced definitively the Kings Stipendiarium quoque pronun

Tributarie: he forthwith both rescued him out of their hands that would have
haled him away: and also kept him close a long time in his own Lodging; and
soon after his Pretorship there expired, when he went into Spain, took the
young gentleman away with him in his own litter among others his followers; and
favorites, and those officers that attended upon him with their knitches of
rods.

His friends he used at all times with so great courtesy and tender respect,

without doors. Moreover, being now become Emperor and Lord of all some of
them he advanced even from the lowest degree unto the highest place of honor.
And when he was blamed and reproved therefore, he professed openly. That if he
had used the help of robbers by the highway side of cutters and swasbucklers
in maintaining of his own dignity; he would not fail but requite them and be
thankful even to such.

He never entertained malice and hatred against any man so deeply but willing
73
he was to lay down the same upon occasion offered. Notwithstanding, C.
MEMMIVS had made most bitter invectives against him, and he again written
unto him as bitterly, yet soon after when the said MEMMIVS stood for the
Consulship, he friended him all that he could with his good word and procured
him voices. When C. CALVUS after certain Libels and defamatorie Epigrams
against him, dealt by the mediation of friends for a reconciliation, he of his
own accord wrote first unto him. As for VALERIVS CATVLLVS (by whose verses
concerning MAMVRRA he could not choose but take knowledge that he was noted and
branded with perpetual infamy when he excused himself unto him and was
ready to make by saying Nollem factum and I am sorry for it: and I would I

satisfaction, he bad him to supper that very day: and as he used before time,
so he continued still to make his fathers house his lodging.

Moreover, in his reuengements he was by nature most mild. Those rouers 74

sworn before that he would hang them upon a cross, he commanded that their
throats should be first cut, and then to be Where ^ote, that cruiying was a

and LATITANT hard ly had escaped (although he gave him a good reward 2.

) but had like to have been brought unto SVLLA, he never could find in his
heart to hurt. PHILEMON a servant and secretary of his, who had promised his
enemies to take his life away by poison, he punished only by simple death,
without any other torment. Being cited and called much upon to bear witness
against P. CLODIUS, for being naught with his wife POMPEIA, who was accused
besides for the same cause to have polluted the sacred Of Bona Dea. in whose
chapel it was the ug^the did the deed disguised in woman's apparel*
Ceremonies, he denied that he ever knew any thing of the matter, or was able
to bring in evide^ce albeit both his mother AVRELIA, and IULIA his sister, had
simply related all upon their credires even before the same Jury and Judges.
And being demanded thereupon, wherefore then he had put away his wife? Because I
deem, quoth he, that those of my house ought to be clear as well of suspicion
as of crime:

The moderation and clemency which he showed as well in the menaging of the 75
civil war, as in his victory, was admirable: When POMPEIVS denounced in
minatory terms, that he would recke^ him for an enenemie, whosoever he was,
that failed to maintain the Commonwealth: He for his part pronounced openly,
That he would make sure account of them to be his, who stood indifferent
between and were Neuters. And so many, as upon the commendation of POMPEIUS
before time, he had give^ any charg or place of command unto, in his army
under him, he granted the^ all free leave and liberty to depart unto him. Upon
Articles and conditions of yielding moved and propounded to POMPEIUS at Ilerda,
whiles between both parts there passed reciprocal dealing and commerce
continually* when AFRANIVS and PETR^IVS had taken within their Camp certain
of CEASARS soldiers, and (which they repented soon after) put them to the
sword, he would in no wise imitate the same perfidious treachery of theirs
practiced against him. At the battle of Pharsalia he cried out, spare all
Citizens; and afterward granted unto every one of his own soldiers (none
excepted) this favor to save each of the^ one of the adverse part, whom he
would: neither were any found or known slain but in the uerie medly, except
AFRANIVS, FAUSTUS, and L. CEASAR the younger and even these uerely, men think,
were not with his good will put to death. Of whom notwithstanding: both the
former, to wit, AFRANIVS and FAUSTUS, after pardon obtained had rebelled and
entered into arms again and L. CEASR for his part, when in cruel manner by
fire and sword he had made hauock of his freed men and bondseruants, spitefully
slew the very wild-beasts also which CEASAR had provided against the
solemnity of a public show to be exhibited before the people. To conclude, in
his very latter days he permitted al those also whom beforetime he had not
pardoned to return into Italy, to govern as magistrates in the City, and to
command as generals in the field. Yea the very Statues of L. SVLLA and POMPEIVS
which the commons had o^erthrown and cast up and down, he erected again in
their due places. And if after this, there was any plot intended or word spoken
against him by his adversaries to his h^rt, he chose rather to repress than to
revenge the same. And so, diverse conspiraces detected and night conuenticles;
he found fault with no farther then thus, by giving notice in some edict and
proclamation. That he had intelligence thereof. And as for such as gave out
bitter speeches of him, he thought it sufficient in an open assembly to give
them an Admonition, not to persist therein. Finally, when in a most slaunderovs

it; devised by PITHOLAUS, his credit and reputation was much cracked and

and diverse mungrell Gauls no better then half Barbarians, he admitted
Senators. Furthermore, over the Mint and receipt of the City-revenewes, he set
certain peculiar servants of his own to be rulers. The charge and command of
three Legions which he left in ALEXANDRIA, he committed wholly to a son of
RVFINUS his freed man, a stale youth and Catanite of his own.

Neither did some words of his which he openly delivered, bewraie less

that he never went about it. But when C* TREBATIUS advertised * Not so much as

colleagues CEASETIVS FLAVUS commanded the said band to be plucked of, and the
man to be had away to prison, he takjng it to heart, either that this overture
to a kingdom sped no better, or, (as he made semblance and pretended himself)
that he was put by the glory of refusing it, sharply rebuked the Tribunes,
and deprived them both of their authority. Neither for all this, was he
willing afterward to put away the infamous note of affecting and seeking after
the title of a King: albeit he both made answer unto a ( a) Comnoner saluting
him by the name of a King, That he was CAESAR and no King: and also at the
Lupercali^, when ANTONIUS the Consul imposed the Diadem oftentimes upon his
head before the ROSTRA, did put it back again, and send it into the Capitol
to ( b) Jupiter Optimus Maximus. Moreover sundry rumors ran rife abroad, that
he would depart (for ever) to ALEXANDRIA or to ( d) Ilium, having at once
translated and removed thither the puissance and wealth of the Empire:
dispeopeld Italy with mustring of soldiers; and with all be taken the
administration of Rome-Citie unto his friends: As also, that in the next
Session of the Senate, L COTTA on of the ( e) Quindecimvirs would move the
house to this effect, That for as much as it was contained in the Fatal books
of SY^ILLA, that the Parthians could not possibly be vanquished but by a King,
therefore CEASAR should be styled King.

This gave occasion to the Conspiratours for to hasten the execution of 80
their design, least of necessity they should be driven to assent thereto.
Their counsels therefore and conferences about this matter, which before time
they held dispersed here and there, and proiected oftentimes by two and three
in a company, they now complotted altogether, for that by this time the very
people joined not in the present state, seeing how things went; but both in
secret and openly also distasted such soueraintie, and called earnestly for
protectors and maintainers of their liberties. Upon the admission of Aliens
into the order of Senators, there was Or ^ill,
a Libell proposed in this form ( a) Bonum Factum etc. That no man would show

81 But CAESAR surely had fair warning of his death before it came, by many
evident prodigies and strange foretokens. Some few months before, when certain
new inhabitants, brought by virtue of the Law Which him self promulged.

build them houses to their lands; and did the same so much the more
diligently and with better will, for that in searching they light upon
manufactures and vessels good store of Antique work: there was found in that
very monument, wherein by report, CAPYS the founder of Capua lay buried, a
brazen Table with a writing upon it in Greek words and Greek letters to this
effect: When the bones and relics of CAPYS happen to be discovered, it shall
come to pass, that one descended from IVLVS shall be murdered by the hands of
his near kinsfolk, and his death soon after revenged with the great
calamities and miseries of all Italy* And least any man should think this to
be a fabulous tale and forged matter, know he that CORNELIUS BALBVS a very
inward and familiar friend of CAESAR is the author thereof: And the uerie day
next preceding his death, those troops of horses which in his passage over
the River R^bicon he had consecrate and let go loose ranging here and there
without a keeper, (as he understood for certain) for bare their meat and would
not to die for it, touch any, yea, and shed tears abundantly. Also, as he
offered sacrifice, the Soothsayer SPVRINA warned him to take heed of danger
toward him, and which would not be differred after the Ides of March. Now; the
very day before the said Ides, it fortuned that as the bird ( a) Or

Regaliolus, was flying with a little branch of Laurel, into the Court of
POMPEIVS, a sort of other birds of diverse kinds from out of the grove hard
by, pursued after and there pulled it in pieces: But that night next before the
day of his murder, both himself dreamed as he lay a sleep, one while, that he
was flying above the clouds: another while, that Jupiter and he shook hands:
and also his wife CALPVRINA, imagined, that the Finiall of his house fell
down, and that her husband was stabbed in her very bosom: and suddenly with
all the chamber door of it self flew open. Hereupon, as also by reason of
sickelinesse, he doubted a good while whether he should keep at home and put
off those matters which he had purposed to debate before the Senate, or no? At
the last, being counseled and persuaded by DECIVS BRUTUS, not to disappoint
the Senators who were now in frequencie assembled and stayed for his coming
long since; he went forth when it was well near eleven of the clock. And when

CAESAR left behind him in the minds of certain friends about him, a
suspicion, 86
that he was neither willing to have lived any longer, nor cared at all for
life: because he stood not well to health, but was evermore crasie: and
thereupon neglected as well all religious warnings from the Gods, as also what
reports soever his friends presented unto him. There be that think, how
trusting upon that last Act of the Senate, and there oath aforesaid, he
discharged the Guard of Spaniards from about him, who armed with swords, gave

upon his person. Others contrariwise are of opinion; that seeing as he did how
he was forelaied on every side, and confessing, it were better once for all to
undergo those imminent dangers, than always to stand in fear thereof, he
was wont to say: It concerned not himself so much as it did the state, that
he should live and be safe: As for him* he had gotten long since power and
glory enough: marie the Commonwealth (if ought but well came to him) should
not be at quiet, but incur the troubles of Civil war* the issue whereof
would be far worse then ever it had been.

This one thing verily, all men well near are agreed upon, That such a 87

funeral, he setting light by so lingering and slow a kind of death, had
wished to die quickly and of a sudden; but also the very day before he was

this point, What was the best end of a man's life? preferred that which was

the eleventh hour of the day; and believed it was to be the soul of CAESAR

set to the uerie Crown of his head. Thought good it was to damme up ( b) the
Court where in he was murdered: to name the Ides of March ( c) Parricidium, and
that the Senate should never meet in Counsel upon that day.

Of these murderers, there was not one in manner that either survived 89

and some again, shortened their own days, with the very same dagger,

THE HISTORY OF Octauius Caesar Augustus,
written by Caius Suetonius Tranquillus.


THat the principal name and lineage of the OCTAVII, dwelt in times past at
Velitrae, there be many evidences to show: For, both a street in the most
frequented place of the said town long since carried the name OCTAVIUS, and
also there was to be seen an Altar there consecrated Or to Octavius: Octaviv
Consecrata:
by one OCTAVIUS, who being General of the field in a war against the
borderers, when he happened to be sacrificing to Mars* upon news brought that
the enemy gave a sudden charge, caught the Inwards of the beast sacrificed
half raw as they were, out of the where they were a boiling or rosting.
fire; cut and offered them accordingly: and so entered into battle and
returned with victory. There is beside, a public Act extant upon record,
wherein decreed and provided it was, that every year after, the inwards in
like manner should be presented unto Mars, and the rest of the sacrifice
remaining, carried back unto the Octauij.

Eagen inter Rom^. o^ ^llect*
These Octauij, being by K. TARQVINIVS PRISCVS naturalized Romans 2
soon after translated and admitted by SERVIVS TVLLVS, into the Senate among
the Patritians, and Nobles, in process of time ranged themselves with the
commons, and with much ado at length, by the means of JULIUS of sacred Memrie
returned to the Patritian degree again: The first of these that by the peoples
election bare any Magistracy, was C. RUFUS: who having been Questor begat Cn.

estate of life far different. For Cn. and all the rest from him one after
another, attained to places of highest honor but CAIUS and his posterity

Tribune, in Sicilie, under AEMILIVS PA^VS Lord general. His father contenting
himself with bearing office like another Burgess in his own Bourrough, being
left welthie by his father, grew to a good estate, and lived to be an old man,
in much peace and tranquillity. But of these matters let others make report.
AUGUSTUS himself writes noe more but thus. That the house from whence he
came* was of Roman Gentlemen, welthie and ancient withal, wherein the first
that ever came to be Senator was his father. M. ANTONIUS hi^teth him in the
teeth with his great Grandfather: saying he was but a Libertine borne, and by

banquer. Neither have I found any more, as touching the Ancestors of
AUGUSTUS by the Fathers side:

OCTAVIUS his father, from the very beginning of his age, was of great 3
wealth and reputation; so that I cannot but mervaile, that he also has been
reported by some a banquer or money changer: yea and one of the ( a) dealers of
money and servitours employed in CAMPVS MARTIVS, by those that stand for
offices: For having been from his very cradle brought up in wealth highly
and plentifully; he both attained unto honorable dignities with facility, and
administered the same with credit and reputation. Presently upon his
Pretourshippe, the province of Macedonie fell unto his lot. And in his journey
thither, the fugitives, to wit the relics of SPARTACVS and CATILINES forces,
who then held the Thurine teritorie he defaited; having commission
extraordinarily given unto him in the senate so to do: This province he
governed with noe less justice then fortitude. For having discomfited in a
great battle the Bessi and the Thracians, he dealt so well with the Allies
and confederats of that Kingdom: that there be certain letters of M. TVLLIVS
CICERO extant, wherein he exhorts and admonishes his brother QVINTVS, (who
at the same time, little to his credit and good name, administered the
proco^sulship of Asia) for to imitate his neigbour OCTAVIUS, in doing well by
the Allies, and winning their love thereby.

As he departed out of Macedonie before that he could profess himself to 4
be a suitor for the Consulship, he died a sudden death* leaving these
children behind him alive, namely two daughters OCTAVIA the elder, which he
had by ANCHARIA: OCTAVIA the younger, and AUGUSTUS likewise, by ATIA. This ATIA
was the daughter of M. ATIVS BALBVS, and IVLIA the sister of C. CAESAR. BALBVS
by his fathers side was an ARICINE, a man that showed Senators Images and
arms in his house: by his mother linked to MAGNUS POMPEIVS in the nearest
degree of consanguinitie. And having borne the office of Pretorship he among
the XX. Commissioners divided by virtue of the Law IVLIA, the lands in the
territory of CAPVA among the Commons. But M. ANTONIUS, despising the parentage
and petegree of AUGUSTUS by the mother side also, twitteth him and lays in
his dish, that his great Grandsire was an African borne saying on while, that
he kept a shop of sweet oils, Ointments and perfumes; another while, that he
was a baker in Aricia. CASSIVS verily of PARMA, in a certain Epistle: taxes

the ( a) palatine quarter of the City, at a place: called Ox or Bullheads.
CAPITA BV^VLA: where now it has a sacred Chapel, built and erected a little
after he depar ted out of this world: For, as it is found in the records of the
Senate, when C. LECTORIVS a young gentleman of the Patritian order, pleaded to
have some easier punishment for the adultery, and alleged, over and besides
his young years and pare^tage, this also in his plea* before the Senators,
that he was the possessor and as it were, the warden and Sextaine of that
ground or soil, which AUGUSTUS of happy memory touched ( b) first, and
requested that it might be given and gran ted unto the said AUGUSTUS as to his
domestical and peculiar god: decreed it was that the same part of the house
should be consecrated to that holy use. There is yet to be seen the place of
his nourcery, within a suburbian house belonging 6
to his Auncesters, near unto Velitra: a very little Cabin, about the bigness
of a Larder or Pantry: the neighbors are possessed with a certain conceit, as
if he had been there also borne. To enter into this row me unless it be of
necessity and with devout chastity, men make it scrupulous and are affraide:
upon an old conceived opinion, as if unto as many as came thither rashly and
inconsiderately, a certain horror and fearefulnes were presented. And verily,
this was soon after confirmed by this occasion: For when the new Land lord and
possessor of that farm house, either by chance and at unwares, or else to try
some experime^t, went into it, there to take up his lodging, it happened that
in the night within very few hours after, being driven out from thence by
some sudden violence, (he knows not how,) he was found in manner half dead,
together with bed and all, before the door,

Being yet an infant, surnamed he was THURINVS, in memorial of the beginning 7
of his Ancestors: or else because in the country about Thurij, when he was
newly borne, his father OCTAVIUS fought a battle against the Fugitives. That
he was surnamed THVRINVS, my self am able to report by a god and sufficient
evidence, as having gotten an old little counterfeit in brass representing
him being a child: which had in iron letters and those almost worn out, this
name engraven. This said counterfeit, being given by me unto the Hadrian the
Emperor*
Prince, is now devoutely kept and worshipped among other his bed chamber
Images. Moreover called he is oftentimes in taunting wise by M. ANTONIUS in his
Epistles; THVRINVS: and himself writes unto him back again as touching that
point, nothing but this* That he marvaileth why that former name of his should
be objected unto him as a reproach. Afterward, he assumed the surname of C.
CAESAR* and after it of AUGUSTUS: the one by the last will of his great Uncle,
by the mother side, the other by the virtue of MVNATIVS PLANCVS his sentence:
For when some gave their opinion, that he ought to be styled ROMULUS, as if he
also had been A Founder of the City, PLANCVS prevailed, that he should be
called rather AUGUSTUS: not only for that it was a new Surname, but also
greater and more honorable, because Religious and holy places, wherein also
any thing is consecrated by bird flight, and feeding of them be called AUGUSTA,
ab auctu. i. of growing, or else ab avium gestu gustuve: i. Of birds gesture
and feeding. Like as ENNIVS also teaches writing in this manner.

Auguste Augurio postquam inclyta condita Roma est.

After that Noble Rome was built by sacred flight of Birds.

He was 4* years old when his father died: and in the xij. year of his age 8
he praised in a public assembly, his Grandmother IVLIA deceased. Four
years after having put on his virill robe, he had ( a) military ( b) gifts
bestowed upon him at the African triumph of CAESAR, albeit by reason of his
young years he had not once served in the wars: Soon after, when his Uncle
(CAESAR) was gone into Spain against Cn. POMPEIVS children, he followed with
in a while, (being as yet not well recovered out of a greevous sickness,) even
through ways infested by enemies, with very few in his train to accompany
him, and having suffered shipwreck besides: whereby he mightily won his Uncles
love, who quickly approved his towardly behavior and disposition, over and
above his diligence in travail* When CAESAR, after he had recovered Spain and
brought it to his subjection, intended a voyage against the otherwise called
(...),
Daci, and from thence against the Parthians, he being sent before to Apollonia,
became a Student there and followed his book. And so soon as he had certain
intelligence that CEASAR was slain, and himself made his heir: standing in
doubt and suspense a long time, whether he should implore the help of the
Legions os no? at length he gave over that course verily, as too hasty and
untimely, but when he was returned again to Rome, he entered upon his
inheritance, not withstanding his mother made some doubt thereof and his father
in law MARTIVS His mothers husband.
PHILIPPUS a man of Consular degree much dissuaded him there fro. And from that
time having levied and assembled his forces, he governed the common wealth first
joint ly with ( c M. ANTONIUS and M: LEPIDVS for the space almost of 12: years,
and at the last for xliiij: years by himself alone:

Having thus laid open the very sum as it were, of his life, I will go through
9
the parts there of in particular: not by the times but by the several kinds
thereof. to the end the same may be showed and known more distinctly: Five
civil wars he made to wit, at Mutine, Philippi, Perusium in Sicilie, and at
Actium. Of which the first and last were against M: ANTONIUS: the second
against BRUTUS and CASSIUS the third against L. ANTONIUS brother to the
Triumvir, the 4. against Sex. POMPEIUS, Cn. POMPEIUS his son. Of all these
wars he took the occasion and quarrel from hence, namely, reputing and
judging in his mind nothing more meet and convenient than the revenge of his
unkles death and the maintenance of his acts and proceedinges.

No sooner was he returned from Apollonia, but he purposed to set upon BRVTUS
and CASSIUS at unwares: and (because upon foresight of danger they 10
were fled secretly out of the way) to take the course of law, and in their
absence A, V, C 710*
to endite them of murder. As for the Plays and games for CEASARS victory
because they durst not exhibit them, whose lot and office it was so to do,
himself set them forth. And to the end that he might go through all other
matters also more resolutely; he professed himself to labor for the Of the
commons.
Tribuneship in the rowme of one who fortuned to die: albeit he was one of the
Nobility, though not of the Senate. But seeing that M. ANTONIUS the Consul
withstood his attempts, where as he hoped he would have been his principal
friend in that suit: and vouchsafed not unto him so much as the assistance of
his own public authority, or help procured from others in any thing, without
he agreed and covenanted to yield unto him some exceeding consideration: he
betook himself unto the protection of those Nobles and chief Senators unto
whom he perceived that ANTONIUS was odious: in this regard especially, that ^
Antonius.
he endeavored all that he could by force of arms to expel DECIMUS BRVTUS
besieged at Mutina, out of that province which by CEASAR was granted and by the
Senate confirmed unto him. And thereupon by the advice and persuasion of some
he set certain persons privily in hand to murder ANTONIUS; which perilous
practice of his being detected and fearing still the like danger to himself,
he waged the old soldiers with as beautiful a larges as possibly he could, A.
V. C. 711.
for the defense as well of his own person as of the state. And being
appointed to lead this army thus levied, in quality of propretour and
together with HIRTIUS and PANSA, who had entered upon the Consulship* to aid D.
BRVTUS, he made an end of this war committed unto him within three months,
in two fought fields. In the former of which, ANTONIE writes that he fled,
and without coat armor or horse appeared at length after two days and showed
himself. But in the battle next following, well known it is, that he
performed the part not only of a Captain but also of a soldier* and in the
very heat and midst of the medly, by occasion that the Standerd bearer of his
own Legion was grievously hurt, he supported the Aegle with his own shoulders
As mass^e and heavy as it was.
and so carried it a good while.

During this war, when HIRTIUS had lost his life in the conflict, and 11
PANSA soon after of his wound, it was bruited rifely abroad, that both of
them were by his means slain: to the end that having defaited ANTONIUS, and
the Commonwealth being bereift of both Consuls, he alone might seize upon
the victorious armies. And verily the death of PANSA was so deeply suspected
that GLYCO the Physician was committed to ward and durance, as if he had put
poison into his wound. AQVILLIUS NIGER adds moreover and says, that the one
of the Consuls, to wit, HIRTIUS, was in the very confused medly of the
battle killed by AVGUSTUS himself.

But so soon as he understood that ANTONIE after his flight was entertained 12
by M. LEPIDVS: that other Captains also and armies consented to take part
with Prop^rtibus: of Pomperus and the common wealth. if you read pro petri^ i.
with the Nobility
the side* he forsook without all delays the cause of the Nobles and
principal Senators: and for the better pretense of this change and alteration
of his mind, craftily and uniustly alleged the words and deeds of certain
of them* as if ( a) some had given it out of him: That he was a boy, (b)
Others, that he was to be Et tollendum.
adorned, and * honored: That neither himself nor the old beaten soldiers
might be rewarded according to their deserts. And the better to approove his
repentance of the former side and faction that he took: He fined the Nursines,
in a great sum of money, and more than they were able to pay; For that upon
the Monuments or Tomb of those Citizens that were slain in the battle at
Mutina (which at their common charges was reared) they wrote this Title, That
they died for the Liberty and Free-dome of their City.

Being entered into Society with ANTONIE and LEPIDVS, he finished 13
the Philippian war also, (although he was but weak and sickely,) and that
A. V. C 712.
with two battles* in the former being discamped and driven out of the field,
hardly he escaped by flight and recovered the Regiment or wing of ANTONIUS.
Neither used he moderately the success of his victory, but when he had sent
the head of BRVTUS to Rome for to be bestowed under the Statue of CAESAR, he
dealt cruelly with the Noblest and most honorable prisoners, and not without
reproachful words: so far forth verily, that to one of them, making humble
suite and prayer for his Sepulture, he answered, (by report) in this wise. That
it would be anon, at the dispose of the f^ules of the Air: and when others,
to wit, the ( a) Father, and son together entreated for their lives; he
commanded them either to cast lots or try by combat whether of them should
have life granted* and so beheld them both as they dyed, whilst the father who
offered himself to die was slain, and the son voluntarily take his death.
Whereupon the rest, and amongst them M FAVONIUS that worthy follower of CATO,
when they were brought forth with their yrons and chains to execution, after
they had in honorable terms saluted ANTONIUS by the name of Sovereign commander
Emperor, openly reviled and let fly at him most foul and railing words.
Having parted between them their charges and offices after this victory, when
ANTONIUS undertook to settle the East in good order, and himself to bring the
old Soldiers back into Italy, and to placethem there, in the lands and
teritories belonging to the free Towns and Burowghes, he kept himself in
favor neither with the said old soldiers, nor the former possessors of those
lands: whilst the one sort complained, that they were disseized: and the
other, that they were not well entreated according to their hope, for so good
deserts.

At which very time, he forced L. ANTONIUS (who confidently presuming 14
upon the Consulship which he then bare, and his brothers power withal, went
A. V. C. 713.
about to make an insurrection and alteration in the state) to fly unto
PERVSIA, and there for very hunger compelled him to yield* but yet not without
great jeopardie of his own person, both before and after the war: for when
at a certain solemn sight of stage plays; he had commanded an ordinary and
common soldier who was set within the ( a) 14. ranks, to be raised by an
officer, and thereupon a rumor was carried and spread by his malicious ill
willers and backbiters, as if presently after torture he had put the same
soldier to death. There lacked very little, but that in the concourse and
indignation of the militarre multitude, he had come to a mischief and been
murdered. This only saved his life: that the man for a while missed, suddenly
was to be seen again alive and safe without any harm done unto him. About
the walls of Perusia, as he sacrificed, he had like to have been intercepted
by a strong company of sword fencers that sallied out of the Town.

After he had forced PERVSIA; he proceeded to the execution of very many, 15

and ever as any went about either to crave pardon or to excuse themselves,
with this on word he stopped their mouths, Die ye must. Some write, that iij:

L. ANTONIUS there leader, might be detected: that having once vanquished them
and confiscated their goods, the rewards promised unto the old soldiers he
might the better perform.

upon his humble submission and supplication, pardoned his life, but confined
him for ever to Circeij. Some Critickes begin here a new Chapter.
The Society of M. ANTONIUS wavering always in doubtful tea^mes and
uncertain, and notwithstanding many and sundry reconciliations, not well knit
and confirmed, he brake of quite in the end: and the better to prove and make
good that he ( c) had degenerated from the civil behavior and modesty of a (
Roman) Citizen, he caused the last will and testament of the said ANTONIE,
which he had left at (d) Rome, and therein nominated even the Children of
CLEOPATRA among his heirs to be opened and red in a public assembly. Howbeit
when he was judged by the State an enemy, he sent back unto him those of
his nearest acquaintance and inward friends and among other C. SOSIUS, ( e)
and T. Cn. Domitius

on his side. Not long after, he vanquished him in a Nauall battle before ( g)
Actium, what time by reason that the fight continued until it was late A. V.
C. 723:
in the evening he was forced to lodge all night conqueror as he was, on ship
board.

When he had retired himself from Actium into the Island Samos for his 17
winter harbor, being disquieted with the news of his soldiers mutiny
demanding rewards and discharge from service; those I mean, whom after the
victory atcheived he had from out of the whole number sent before to Brindis,
he went again into Italy: but in crossing the Seas thither; twice was he
tossed and troubled with Tempests: first between the promontories or Capes of
Pol^ponensus and Actolia: again, about the Mountains or Cliffes Ceraunij. In
both which places, part of his pinnaces were cast away and drowned: and with
all, the very takling of that ship wherein he embarked was rent and ^orne a
sunder: yea, and the rudder thereof quite broken. Neither stayed he at Brindis
above 27, days, that is to say until he had settled his A. V. C* 724
soldiers and contented them in their desires and requests: but fetching a
compass about Asia, and Siria, sailed into Egypt where after he had laid
seige unto ALEXANDRIA, whether ANTONIE and CLEOPATRA were together fled* He
soon became Mais. of that City. And as for ANTONIE, who now (all to late)
made means for conditions of peace he enforced to make himself away, and
Viditque more: In some copies we read thus: (...) mort^am Cleopatram, (...) And

saw him dead And to CLEOPATRA whom most gladly he would have saved alive for
to beautify his triumph he set the ( a) PSYLLI to suck out the venime and
poison within her body: for that supposed it was she died with the sting of
the Serpent ( b) Aspis: This honor he did unto them both, namely to bury them
in one sepulcher: and the Tomb by them begun, he commanded to be finished.
Young ANTONIE the elder of those twain whom he had by FVLVIA, he caused to be
violently haled from the Statue of JULIUS CAESAR of famous memory, unto which,
after many prayers but all in vain; he was fled as to sanctuary, and so
killed him. Likewise CAESARIO, when CLEOPATRA gave out openly that she had
conceived by his His great Uncle indeed but father by adoption:
father CAESAR, he fetched back again from the place whither he was fled, and
put him to death. The rest of the Children of ANTONIE and the Queen together,
he both saved (no less than if they had been linked in near Alliance unto
himself,) and also according to the state of every one of them, he maintained
and cherished respectively.

About the same time, when he beheld the Tomb together with the corpse of 18
ALEXANDER the great, taken newly forth of the vaute or secret Chapel where
it was bestowed; he set upon it a coronet of gold: and strewing flowers
thereupon worshipped it: And being asked the question, whither he would * Or

look upon the PTOLOMES also? he answered that he was desirous indeed to see a
King but not the ( a) dead. When he had reduced Egypt in the form of a
province, to the end that he might make it more fruitful and fit to yield
corn and victuals for the City of Rome, he skowred and cleansed by help of
soldiers, all those ditches where into Nilus overfloweth, which by long time
had been choked with mud. And that the memory of his Actiake victory might
be more renowned among posterity, he built the City Nicopolis over against

having enlarged the old Which stood upon the said promontarie actium.

Navall spoils and then consecrated it to Neptune and Mars.

After this, sundry tumults and the very beginnings of commotions and
insurrections, 19
many conspiracies also detected before they grew to any head, he suppressed:

armies: and TELEPHVS purposed upon a deep conceit that the soveraintie of
dominion was by the Destinies and will of God due unto him, even to lay upon
him and the Senate violent hands. And more then that, one time there was taken
near unto his bedchamber by night, a camp-slave belonging to the ILLYRIAN
army, who had deceived the porters and gotten thither with a wood knife at his
side, but whether he were out of his wits, or feigned himself mad, it was
uncertain: for nothing could be wrung out of him by examination upon the

in one battle he gat a blow upon his right knee with a stone: and in an
other, not his leg only, but also both his arms were hurt with the fall from
a ( b) * Or turret of wood.
bridge, The rest of his wars he managed by his Lieftennants: yet so as that
in some of them namely the Pannonian and the German; he would either come
between times, or else remain not far of: making his progress from the
City of Rome, as far as to Rauenna, or Millaine or to Aquileia.

He subdued partly by his own conduct in proper person, and in part by 21
his Lieftenants having commission immediately from him and directed by his
auspicies Cantabria, Aquitaine, Pannonia and Dalmatia together with all
Illyricum, Rhaetia likewise, the Vindelicis, the Salassians and the Nations
inhabiting the Alps. He repressed also the Incursions of the Dukes, having
slain three of their Generals with a great number of them besides. And the
Germans he remooved and set further of; even beyond the river Albis. Howbeit,
of these the Suevians and the Sicambrians, because they yielded themselves, he
brought over into Gaul, and placed them in the lands next unto Rhene. Other
Nations being mal-content, he reduced unto his obedience. Neither made he
war upon any people without just and necessary causes: and so far was he
from desire of enlarging his Empire, or advancing his martial glory, that he
compelled certain princes and potentates of the Barbarians, to take an oath in
the Temple of Mars ( a) the Revenger for to continue in their allegiance, and
in the protection and peace which they sued for: yea and from some of them he
assaied to exact a new kind of Hostages, even V^usuall in those days.
women, for that he perceived, that they neglected the pledges of the males.
And yet he gave the^ liberty, as often as they would, to receive their
hostages again. Neither proceeded he at any time against those, who either
usually or trecherously above the rest took arms and rebelled, to any
punishment more grievous then this, even to sell the^ as captives: with this
condition, that they should not serve in any neighbor Country, nor be manumised
and made free within the space of Or 20* rather
30. years. By which fame of virtue and moderation that went of him, he
induced and drew the very Indians and Scythians, Nations known by report and
here say only, to make suite of their own accord by Ambassadors, for amity
of him and the people of Rome. The Parthians also, when as he laid claim unto
Armenia, yielded soon unto him: and those military Ensigns which they had
taken from M. CRASSVS and M. ANTONIUS, they delivered unto him again at his
demand: and moreover, offered hostages unto him. And finally when there were
many Competitours together at one time claiming a title to the Kingdom, they
would not allow of any, but one by him elected.

again, after the Sicilian. He kept three Triumphs riding in his chariot: to

for three days together.

Of shameful foiles and grievous overthrowes, he received but two in all: 23
and those in no place else but in Germany; namely when LOLLIVS and Quintilius
Varus.
VARVS were defaited. That of LOLLIVS, was a matter of dishonor more than
loss and damage; but the other of VARVS, drew with it in manner utter
destruction as wherein three Legions with their General; the Lieutenant; and
A. V. C. 738 762
( a) Auxiliaries, all were slain. Upon the news of this Infortunity* he
proclaimed a set watch both day and night through the City of Rome; for fear
of some tumult and uprore: and the commissions of Presidents and Deputies over
Provinces, he renewed and enlarged their time of government: to the end, that
the Allies of the people of Rome might be kept in a leageance by governors,
such as were both skillful and also acquainted with them. He vowed also the

head against the doors, crying out, QUINTILLVS VARVS, Deliver up thy Legions
again. And the very ( b) day of this unfortunate calamity he kept every year
mournful, with sorrow and lamentation.

24 In warfare and feats of arms, he both altered and also instituted many
points: yea and some he reduced to the ancient manner. ( a) Military
discipline he exercised most severely. He permitted not so much as any of his
Lieutenants, but with much ado and coffeehouse, to visit other-whiles
their wives; and never but in the ( b) winter months. A Roman Knight, for
cutting off the ( c) thombs of two young men his sons, to avoid the military
oath and war service, he set in open po^t sale, himself (I say) and all his
goods. Whom notwithstanding, because he saw the ( d) Publicanes about to buy,
and bid very well for him, he appointed and delivered to his own Freed man;
that being confined and sent away unto his living and lands in the Country, he
might permit him to live as Free. The tenth Legion, for being stubborn and
unwilling to obey, he dismissed all and whole with ignominy. Other legions

ground and reculed, he tithed, that is to say, executed every tenth man of
them: and the rest, he allowed barley in steed of wheat to feed upon. Those
centurions who forsook their Stations, he punished with death, even as well as
the common soldiors of their bands: and for other kinds of Delinquencie he put
them to shame sundry ways, as commanding them to stand all the day long before

foot perches in their hands; or else carrying turfes of earth.

After the civil wars, he called none of his soldiers either in any public
speech, or by way of edict or proclamation, by the name of ( a) Fellow
soldiers, 25
but plain Soldiers. Nay he would not suffer them otherwise to be termed so
much as by his sons, or his wives sons: thinking it was a more affected
manner of Appellation than stood either with martial Law, or the ( a) quietness
of those times, or the majesty of himself and his house: ( b) Libertines he
employed in soulderie unless it were at Rome about skarfires by night, (not
withstanding there was feared some tumult and uprore by occasion of great
dearth and scarcity) but twice only: once in garizon for defense of those
Colonies which bounded fast upon Illyricum; a second time for keeping the banks
of the river of Rhene*. And those, being as yet bond, imposed upon men and

nor in the same manner armed. As for military gifts he gave unto his
soldiers trappers collars and Quicquid auro argentoque constaret: or rather,

whatsoever stood upon gold or silver, much sooner than ( c) Vallar or Mural
coronets which were more honorable. These he bestowed most sparily; and when
he did, it was without suit made therefore: and many times upon the common ( d)
and base soldiers. He gave unto M. AGRIPPA after a nauale victory in Cilicia a
blew streamer. Those Captains only who had triumphed, albeit they were both
companions with him in his expeditions, and also partakers of his victories, he
thought not meet to be rewarded with any gifts at all: because they also had
power to bestow the same upon whom they would. Moreover he deemed nothing less
beseeming a perfect and accomplished Captain, than hast-making and rashness.
And therefore, these mots and sentences were rife in his mouth. (...),

he proscribed C. TORANIVS also, his own Tutour and guardian, yea and the
companion in the Office of Aedileship with his father OCTAVIUS. JUNIUS
SATVRNINVS writes moreover, that after the proscription was ended, when M.
LEPIDVS had in the Senate House excused all that was past and given good hope
of clemency for the time to come, because there had been execution enough
done already: he on the contrary side professed openly, That he had
determined no other end of the said proscription, but that he might have
liberty still to proceed in all things as he would. Howbeit, in testimony of

in an assembly whereunto he had admitted a multitude of Paganes, that is to
say, such as were no soldiers, and espied him there to take notes of
something that he delivered before the soldiers, supposing him to be over
busy and a spy,) should be stabbed to death even in his sight: yea, and he
terrified TEDIVS AFER, Consul elect, (because he had maliciously in some
spiteful terms depraved something that he had done) with so great menaces,
that in a melancholy he cast himself headlong and brake his own neck.
Likewise, as Q. GALLIVS the Pretour held under his robe a pair of duple
writing tables, when he came of course to do his duty and salute him; he
suspecting, that he had a (short) sword hidden underneath, and not daring
straight-waies to search him farther, for fear something else than a sword
should be found about him; within a little while after caused him to be haled
out of the Tribunal seat of Judgment, by the hands of certain Centurions

confess nothing, commanded him to be killed; having first with his own hands
plucked his eyes out of his head. Howbeit AUGUSTUS writes, that the said
GALLIVS by pretending to parle secretly with him, laid wait for his life;

Revenger: The temple of APOLLO in Palatinus; The temple likewise of JUPITER the
Thunderer, in the Capitol. The reason why he built the said Foru^, was the
multitude of men and their suites: which because, ( a) ij. would not suffice,
seemed to have need of a third also. And therefore with great speed erected it
was for that public use, even before the temple of MARS was finished. And
expressly provided it was by law, that in it public causes should be determined
apart, and choosing of Judges (or Iuries) by it self. The temple of Mars he
had vowed unto him, in the Philippian war which he took in hand for the
revenge of his fathers death. He ordained therefore by an Act, that here the
Senate should be consulted with, as touching wars and triumphs: that from
hence those Pretours or Governors who were to go into their provinces should
be honorably attended and brought onward on their way: and that hither they
should bring the ensigns and ornaments of triumph, who returned with victory.
The temple of Apollo he reared in that part of the Palatine house, which being
smitten with lightning was by that God required, as the Soothsayets out of
their learning had pronounced: hereto was adjoined a gallerie, with a library
of Latin and Greek books. In which temple, he was wont in his old age both
to sit oftentimes in counsel with the Senate, and also to over-see and review
the Decuries of the Judges. He consecrated the temple unto IVPITER the
Thunderer, upon occasion that he escaped a danger, what time as in his
Cantabrian expedition, as he travailed by night, a flash of lightning glaunced
upon his licter, and struck his servant stone dead, that went with a light
before. Some works also he made under other folks names, to wit his nephew,
his wife and sister; as the Gallerie and stately Palace of His daughters
children by Agrippa.
LUCIUS and CAIUS: likewise the Gallerie or Porches of LIVIA and OCTAVIA: the
Theater also of MARCELLUS. Moreover diverse other principal persons he
oftentimes exhorted to adorn and beautify the City, every man according to
his ability either by erecting new monuments, or else by repairing and
furnishing the old. By which means many an Aedifice was by many a man built:
as namely the temple of Hercules and the Atriu^ libertatis A trium, quasi
aithrio^. A place where learned men were wont to meet and confer, as our
Merchants do in the Royal Exchange. built not unlike unto it with arched

of Liberty by ASINIUS POLLIO: A temple of Saturn by MUNATIUS PLANCUS: a
Theater by CORNELIUS BALEUS; and an ( b) Amphitheatre by Statillus Taurus: but
many and those very goodly monuments by M. AGRIPPA.

30 The whole space of the City he divided into ( a) wards and streets. He
ordained, that as Magistrates or Aldermen yearly by lot should keep and
govern the former: so their should be Masters or Constables elected out of
the Commons of every street, to look unto the other. Against skarefires he
devised night-watches and watchmen. To keep down Inundations and Deluges, he
enlarged and cleansed the channel of the River Tiberis, which in times past
was full of rammell and the ruins of houses, and so by that means narrow and
choked. And that the Avenues on every side to the City might be more passable,
he took in hand himself to repair the high way or Cawsie Flaminia, so far
as to ARIMINNUM* and the rest he committed to sundry men who had triumphed, for
to ^ave; and the charges thereof to be befraied out of the money raised of
spoils and sackage. The sacred Churches and Chapels decayed and ruinate by
continuance of time, or consumed by fire he reedified: and those together with
the rest he adorned with most rich oblations; as who brought into the Cell, or
Tabernacle of Jupiter Capitolinus at one Donation, 16000 pound weight of gold,
besides precious stones valued at 50 millions of Sesterces.

But after that he entered now at length upon the High priesthood when 31
A. V. C. 741.
LEPIDVS was once dead, which he never could find in his heart to take from
him whiles he lived: what books soever of prophesies and destinies went
commonly abroad in Greek and Latin, either without authors, or such as were
not authentical and of credit, he caused to be called in from all places, to
the number of 2000 and above: and when he had burnt them, he retained those
only of Sibyls prophesies. And even of those also he made some special choice:
and bestowed them close in two little Desks or coffers under the base and
piedstoole of APOLLO PALATINVS. The years revolution reduced as it was into
order by JULIUS of sacred memory, but afterward through negligence troubled
and confused, he brought again to the former calculation. In the dispose
whereof, he called the month Sextilis (rather than September wherein he was
borne*) by his own name, because in it there befell unto him both his first
Consulship and also notable victories. Of all the Religious and priests, but
especially of the vestall virgins he augmented the number, the dignity and the
commodities also. And whereas in the rowme of any vestall Nun deceased, there
must another of necessity be chosen and take, he perceiving many to make suite
that they might not put their daughters to the lottery; protested and bound it
with an oath, that if any one of his own Nieces or daughters daughters were of
competent age he would present her to the place. Diverse ancient ceremonies
also which by little and little were disused and abolished, he restored again,
as namely the ( a) Augurie of SALVS, the Flaminship of IVPITER, the sacred
Lupercal, the ( b) Saecular plays and the Compitalitij. At the Lupercall
Solemnities, he commanded that no beardlesse boys should run. Likewise, at
the Secular plays, he forbad young folk of both sexes, to frequent any show
exhibited by night; unless it were in the company of some ancient person of
their kindred. The Tutelare Images of crosse-wayes called Lares Compitales he
was the first that ordained to adorn twice in the year with flowers of the
spring and summer seaso^s. The principal honor next unto the immortal gods,
he performed to the memorial of those worthy Captains, who had raised the
Roman onpire from a small thing to so high and glorious a state. And
therefore both the works and monuments of every of them he repaired and made
again, reserving their titles and inscriptions still; and all their Statues
also in triumphant form and shape he dedicated in both the Porches or
galleries of his Hall of Justice. And in a public edict he professed thus
much, That he devised it to this end, That both himself whil^s he lived, and
the Princes or Emperors his successors for the ages to come, might be called
upon and urged by their subjects and Citizens to conform themselnes as it were
to their pattron and example. The Statue * Suppo suit: some read, superpofuit.

Many most dangerous enormities and offensive abuses, which either had 32
continued by custom and licentious liberty during the civil wars, or else
crept in and began in the time of peace to the utter ruin of the Commonwealth,
he reformed. For a number of bold roisters and prosessed Robbers ietted openly

were caught up (by them) as well Free borne as slaves without respect; and kept

perpe trating of mischief whatsoever. Where upon, he disposed streng guards,
and set watches in convenient places: he repressed those Robbers and Hacksters,

burnt, as being the chief matter and occasion of malicious accusations. The
public places and houses in the City, whereof the tenure and hold was
doubtful, he adjudged unto those who were in present possession. The debts and
actions commenced against such as had been troubled and sued a long time in the
Law, by whose mournful habit and distressed estate their adversaries sought
for nothing but pleasure and the fulfilling of their wills he anulled and
denounced this condition withal, that if any one would needs bring them into
new trouble again, he should be liable to the like danger of punishment or
penalty as the molested party was. And to the end that no lewd Or cause.

33 Himself sat daily in Judgment, yea and other whiles until it was dark
night, lying if he had not his health, in a licter which was of purpose set
before the tribunal seat, or else in his own house: and he ministered justice
not only with exceeding severity, but also with as great lenity. For when upon
a time there was one accused for a manifest parricidy, because he should not be
sowed up in a leather ( a) male or budget (a punishment that none suffered but
such as had confessed the Fact) he examined (by report) upon interrogatiues in
this manner, Certes thou never murderedst thy father, did thou? Again, when
as a matter was handled before him as touching a forged will, and all the
witnesses that set their hands and seals thereto, were attaint by the ( b) Law
Cornelia, he delivered unto the Commissioners who had the hearing and deciding
together, of the cause, not only the two (ordinatie) tables of condemnation
and acquitall, but a third also; whereby they might have their pardon, who were
certainly known to have been seduced and brought to be witnesses as is before
said, either by fraudulent practice or error and oversight. As for the
appeals in Court, he yearly assigned those which were for the City-Suiters
unto Pretours of the City; but if they were for Provincial persons unto
certain men of the Consuls degree, such as he had ordained, in every province
one, for to be in commission and to determine provincial affairs.

34 The laws made before time he revised and corrected: some also he ordained
and established anew: as namely ( a) Sumptuaria, as touching expenses at the
board: Of ( b) Adulteries and De p^dicitia, or impudicitia
unnatural filthiness committed with the male kind: Of ( c) indirect suite
for offices. Of the ( d) mutual marriages of Senators and Gentlemen with
Commoners. This act last named, when he had amended and reformed somewhat more
precisely and with greater severitie then the rest, he could not carry clearly
and go through with, for the tumult of those that refused so to do, but that
part of the penalties at length was quite taken away or else mitigated; an Of

3 years, and the rewards besides augmented. And notwithstanding all that,
when the order of Gentlemen stood out stiffly and stoutly calling in open sight,
and publicly for the repealing of the said Statute; he sent for GERMANICUS his
children, and taking some of them himself, and bestowing the others in their
fathers arms, showed and presented them unto their view signifying as well by
the gesture of his hand, as by countenance, That they should not be loath nor
think much, to imitate the example of that young Gentleman. Moreover perceiving

gown, and a short sword or skeine by his side; having a guard also standing
about his chair of estate, to wit, ten of the stoutest and tallest men that
were of Senators degree and all his friends: CORDUS CREMUTIUS writes that
there was not so much as admitted then into the Senatehouse any Senator but
singly one alone by himself, and not before his clothes were well serched and
felt for having any weapon under them. Some of them he brought to this

public feasts. Now, to the end that being thus chosen and allowed (as is
above said) they might with more religious reverence and less trouble execute
the functions belonging to Senators: he ordained, That before any one sat him
down in his chair, he should make devout supplication and sacrifice with
frankincense and wine, at the And that they should not need to come and salute
him, but save that labor.

September and October, none else should be bound to give attendance, save those

devised to institute for himself, and that by casting lots, a privy Counsel
for 6 months: with whom he might treat before hand of businesses and affairs
to be moved unto a frequent Senate House fully assembled. As touching matter of
greater importance put to question, he demanded the opinion of the Senators,
not after the usual manner and in order, but as it pleased himself: to the
end that every man should bend his mind so intentively thereto, as if he were
to deliver his own advise, rather then give assent unto another.

Other things there were besides, whereof he was the author and beginner: 36
and among the rest: That the Acta Senat^ and not Senatu^onsulta: H^ means

the office of Questour ship.

And to the end that more men might bear their part in administration of 37
the common weal, he devised new offices: to wit, The overseeing of the
public works, the surviying of the ways streets, and causies, of the water
courses or conduits, of the channel of Tybris, and distributing corn among the
people. Also the prouostship of the City: One An office which 3: me^ ioinctly

Triumvirate, for choosing Senators; an another for reviewing and visiting the
troops or cornets of horsemen, so often as need required. The Censours, whose
creation was forlet and discontinued, after a long time between, he created
again. The number of pretours he augmented. He required also and demanded,
that so often as the Consulship was conferred upon him he might have for one;
ij. colleagues or companions in office: but he cold not obtain it; whilst all
men with one voice cried out, That his majesty was abridged enough already,
in that he bare not that honorable office by himself, but with another.

gave order, that to 30. Captains and above, there should be granted by
public decree full tryumphs: and to a good many more tryumphall ( a)
ornaments. Senators Children, to the end they might be sooner acquainted with
the affairs of State, he permitted to put on even at the first their viril

studs; and to have their places in the Senate house. Also at their first
entrance into warfare, he allowed them to be, not only O^ men of Arms.

(public) horses, who being above 45. years of age, were unwilling to keep
them still.

Having obtained also by the A senatu or Senatoribus. ^: out of the Senators

Gentleman (that served with the Cities horse) to render an accoumpt of his

punished, others he noted with shame and ignominy: the most part of them with

wasted and decayed their patrimony, and estate in the civil wars, durst not

worth of Roman Gentlemen: He made a review of the people of Rome, street by
street: and to prevent that the common people should not be often called away
from their affairs by occasion of the dole and distributio^ of corn, he
purposed to give out thrice a year, tiquets or talies for to serve 4: months:
But when the people were desirous of the old custom, he granted the^ again to
receive the same upon the ( b) Nones of every month: The ancient right and
liberty also, in Elections and Parliamentes he brought in again: and having
restrained the indirect suing for dignities by manyfold penalties, upon the day
of such electio^s he distributed out of his own purse among the ( e) Fabians
and Scaptians, who were of the same Tribes, wherein himself was incorporate; a
thousand Sesterces a pecce, because they should not look for ought at any of
their hands who stood for offices* Moreover supposing it a matter of great
consequence to keep the people incorrupt and clear from all base mixture of
forain and servile blood; he both granted the freedom of the City of Rome most
sparily, and also set a certain gage and limitatio^ of manumising and
enfranchising slaves* When TIBERIUS made request unto him by letters, in the
behalf of a Grecian, his client to be free of Rome: he wrote back unto him,
That he would not grant it unless he came personally himself and could
persuade him, what just causes he had of his suite: And, what time as LIVIA
entreated the like for a certain Frenchman, tributarie to the Romans: he
flatly denied the freedom of the City, but offered in lieu thereof immunitie
and remission of Tribute; avowing, that he would more easily abide that
somewhat went from the public treasure and chamber of the City, than have
the honor of the Roman City to be made vulgar, and common* Nor content,
that he had by diverse straight edicts and provisoes kept many slaves from all
manner of freedom, but more a great deal fro^ful freedom in the best
condition; as having precisely and with much curiosity put in caveats both for
the number and also for the condition and respect otherwise of those that were
to be made free: he added thus much moreover. That no slave, who had ever been
bound and imprisoned, or examined by torture should obtain the freedom of the
City, in any kind of enfranchisement what soever. The old manner of going
and wearing apparel also, he endeavored to bring into use again. And having
seen upon a time assembled to hear a public speech, a number of Citizens
cladde all in black By black ^e means cloak* or gowns o^ a self russet
color, for their gowns should be white and fair not^ullied

He gave the Aediles in charge not to suffer any person from thence forward, to
abide or stay, either in the Common place or the Cirque* but ( d) in a gown,
laying a side all clokes or mantills thereupon.

His liberality unto all degrees of Citizens he showed often times as occasions
41
and opportunities were offered: for both by bringing into the City in the
ALLEXANDRINE Triumph the treasures of the ( Egyptian Kings he caused so great
plenty of money, that usurie fell, but the price of Lands and Lordships arose
to auerie high reckoning: and also afterward, so often as out of the goods of
condemned persons there was any surplusage of money remaining above their
fines; he granted for a certain time the free lone and use thereof to as many
as were able to put in security for the principal, by an obligation in duple
the sum. The substance and wealth of Senators he augmented, and whereas the
value thereof before amounted to the sums of Duple the worth of Gentlemen.
800000. Sesterces* he taxed or sessed them at 1200000: and look who had not
so much, he supplied and made it up to the full. He gave Largesses:
Congiaries often times to the people but lightly they were of diverse sums,
one while 400, another while 300. and some times 200* and fifty Sesterces: and
he left not so much as boys under age, whereas they had not wont to receive
such congiaries, unless they were above eleven years old: He measured out
also to the people by the Poll, Corn in times of scarcity oftentimes at a
very low price, and otherwhiles freely, without payinge therefore: and as for
the Tickets, of money, he dupled the sum in them contained,

And that you may know, he was a prince more respective of thrift and 42
holesomenes, than desirous of popularitie, praise, and honor: when the people
complained of the want and dearth of wine, he checked and snibbed the^ with
this most severe speech, That his son in law AGRIPPA had taken order good
enough that men should not be athirst, by conueighing so many waters into the
City Unto the same people demanding the congiarie; which indeed was by him
promised, he answered; That his credit was good, and he able to perform his
word: but when they earnestly called for one which he had never promised, he
hit them in the teeth by an edict or proclamation with their dishonestie, and
impudency: assuring them, that give it he would not although he had intended
it.

And with no less gravitie and resolution, when upon his proposing and
publishing of a congiarie, he found that many in the mean time were manumised
and inserted into the number of Citizens, he rejected such, and said; they
should not receive any, unto whom he had made no promise: and to all the rest
he gave less than he promised: that the sum which he had appointed, might
hold out and be sufficient. When upon a time, there was great barrainnesse and
scarcity of corn, being put to an hard exigent and to seek a difficult
remedy, in so much as he was driven to expel out of the City, all the sort
of young slaves pampered and trimmed up for sale, as also whole schools and
companies of Novice-fencers and sword players: all strangers and forainers,
except Physicians and scholemaisters: yea and some of the ordinary household
servants: so soon as the market began to mend, and victuals grew plentiful,
he writes, That it took him in the head to abolish those public doles of
Corn for ever: because upon the trust and confidence of them, tillage was
clean laid down. Howbeit he continued not in that mind long, as being
assured, that the same doles might be set up again one time or other by the
ambitious humor (of Princes his successors.) And therefore after this he
ordered the matter so indifferently, as that he had no less regard of the
Cities fermours of tillage, and other undertakers and purueiours of the
public corn, than of the people and commons of the City.

In number, variety, and magnificence of solemn shows exhibited unto the 43
people he went beyond all men. He reports of himself that he set forth *

plays and games in his own name four and twenty times: and for other
magistrates who either were absent or not sufficient to bear the charges,
three and twenty times Diverse times, he exhibited plays by every street,
and those upon many stages, and acted by plaiers skillful in all languages not
in the Common forum only, nor in the ordinary Amphitheater, but also in the
cirque. In the enclosure called Septa, he never represented any sportes but the
baiting and coursing of wild beasts and the shows of champions-sight; having
built wooden scaffolds and seats for the nonce in Mars field. In like manner,
he made the show of a Navall battle about the River Tiberis, having dug of
purpose a spacious hollow pit within the ground, even there whereas now is to
be seen the grove of the CAESAR'S. On which days he bestowed warders in
diverse places of the city, for fear it might be enda^gered by sturdie
thieves and robbers, taking their vantage, that so few remained at home in
their houses. In the Cirque he brought forth to do their devour. Charioters,
Run: ners, and killers of savage beasts: otherwhiles out of the noblest young
gentlemen of all the City. As for the warlike Riding or Turnament called
Tr^ie, he exhibited it oftenest of all other, making choice of boys to
perform it, as well bigger as smaller* supposing it a matter of antiquity* a
decent and honorable manner besides, that the towardly disposition and proof of
noble blood should thus be seen and known. In this solemnity and sport, he

permitted both himself and also his posterity to bear the surname of
TORQVATVS* But afterward he gave over the representation of such pastimes, by
occasion that ASINIVS POLLIO the Orator, made a grievous and invidious
complaint in the Senate house, of the fall that AESERNINVS his nephew took,
who likewise had thereby broken his leg. To the performance of his stage
plays also and shows of sword fight, he employed some times even the
Gentlemen and knights of Rome: but it was before he was inhibited by virtue of
an Act of the Senate. For after it verily, he exhibited no more, save only a
youth called L, IVIVS, borne of worshipful parentage, only for a show: that
being a dwarf not two foot high, and weighing but 17. l'. yet he had an
exceeding great voice. One day of the sword fight that he set forth, he brought
in for to behold the solemnity, even through the midst of the Show place, the

were brought over unto him, and worthy to be known, to bring it abroad for to

a Rh^noceros within the empaled or railed enclosure called Septa* a Tigre upon
the stage: and a Serpent 50: cubits long, within the Hall Comitium. It fortuned
that during the great Circeian games which he had vowed before, he fell sick:
whereby he lay in his litter and so devoutly attended upon the sacred chariots
called Th^nsae. Again, it happened at the beginning of those plays, which he
set out when he dedicated the temple of Marcellus, that his curule chair
became unioincted, and thereby he fell upon his back: Also at the games of his
nephews when the people their assembled were mightily troubled and astonished,
for fear that the Theater would fall: seeing that by no means he cold hold
them in, nor cause them to take heart again, he removed out of his own place,
and sat him down in that part thereof which was most suspected: The most
confuse and licentious manner of beholding such spectacles, he reformed and
brought into order; moved thereto, by the wrong done to a Senator, whom at
Puteoli in a frequent assemble sittinge at their right solemn Games, noe man
had received to him and vouchsafed a rowne.

Hereupon when a decree of the Senate was passed, That so often as in any place
44
there was ought exhibited publicly to be seen, the first rank or course of
Scates should be kept clear and wholly for Senators: he forbad the

sights he would be absent many hours together, and otherwhiles whole days:
but first having craved leave of the people, and recommended those unto them,
who should sit as presidentes of those Games in his turn. But so often as he
was at them, he did nothing else but intend the same: either to avoid the rumor
and speech of men, whereby his father CAESAR (as he said himself) was commonly
taxed, namely for that in beholding those solemnities he used between whiles
to give his mind to read* letters and petitions, yea and to write back again:
or else upon an earnest desire and delight he had, in seeing such pastimes,
pleasure and contentment, wherein he never dissi^nuled, but oftentimes frankely
professed. And therefore he proposed and gave of his own at the games of prise
and plays even of other men, Coronets and rewards. both many in number, and
also of great worth: Neither was he present at any of these Greek games ( a)
and solemnities, but he honored every one of the Actors and provers of

Greeks) but such also as out of the common sort of townes-men; fell together by
the ears pell mell in the narrow streets, and though they had no skill at all
of fight, yet could lay on load, and offend their concurrents one way or other.
In sum all those in general, who had any hand in those public games or set
them forward any way, he deigned good rewards and had a special respect of
them. The privileges of Champions he both maintained entier, and also
amplified. As for sword fencers he would not suffer the^ to enter into the
lists, unless they might be discharged of that profession, in case they became
victours. The power to chastise Actours and plaiers at all times and in every
place (granted unto the Magistrates by ancient law) he took from them, save
only during the plays and upon the stage. Howbeit he examined straightly
nevertheless at all times either the matches or combats of Champions called (
b) Xystici, or the fights of sword fencers. For the licentiousness of stage
plaiers he so repressed, that when he had for certain found out, That

Having in this manner ordered the City and administered the civil affairs
therein, 46
he made Italy populous and much frequented with ( a) Colonies to the number ber

public works and revenues in many places. He equalled it also after a sort,
and in some part with the very City of Rome in privileges and estimation:

where of by yearly Magistrates was neither easy nor safe; he undertook
himself to ( a) rule: the ( b) rest he committed to Proconsuls by lot: And
yet otherwhiles he made exchange of such Provinces: and of both sorts, he
oftentimes visited many in person. Certain Cities, confederate and in league
with Rome, howbeit by overmuch liberty running headlong to mischief and
destruction, he deprived of their liberties. Others again, either deeply in
debt he eased, or subverted by earthquake he reedified, or able to allege
their merits and good turns done to the people of Rome he endowed with the
franchises of Latium; or else with freedom of Rome. There is not, I suppose, a
Province, (except Afric only and Sardinia) but he went unto it. Into these
Provinces after he had chaced SEXTUS POMPEIUS thither, he prepared to sail out
of Sicilie and to cross the Seas: but continual storms and extreme tempests
checked him: neither had he good occasion or sufficient cause afterward to
pass over unto them.

48 All those kingdoms which he wan by conquest and force of arms, unless
some few, he either restored unto those Princes from whom he had taken them,
or else made them over to other. KK. mere Aliens, Princes, his Associates he
conjoined also together among themselves by mutual bonds of alliance, as being
a most ready procurer and maintainer of affinity and amity of every one;
neither had he other regard of them all in general than of the very natural
members and parts of his own Empire. Moreover, he was wont to set Guardians
and Governors over the said Princes, when they were either young and under
age, or lunatic and not well in their wits; until such time as they were
grown to ripe years, or began to come again to themselves. The children of
very many of them, he both brought up and also trained and instructed together
with his own.

49 Out of his military forces, he distributed both Legions and Auxiliaries by
Provinces. He placed one fleet at Misenum, and another at Ravenna, for the
defenses of the Superi, called otherwise the Adriatich Sea: Venice gulf.

of his body, unto the disasterous overthrow of VARUS: And yet he suffered not at
any time, to remain within the City more then 3 cohorts, and those without
their pavilions. The residue, his manner was to send away to wintering places
and summer harbors about the neighbor-towns. Moreover, all the soldiers
that were in any place whatsoever, he tied to a certain prescript form and
proportion of wages and rewards, setting down according to the degree and
place of every one, both their times of warfare, and also the Fees, pensions,
land and living.
commodities they should receive after the term of their service expired and
their lawful discharge, least that by occasion of old age, or for want, they
should after they were freed from warfare, be solicited to sedition and
rebellion. And to the end, that for ever, and without any difficulty, there
might be defrayed sufficient to maintain and reward them accordingly, he
appointed a peculiar Treasuri^ for soldiors with new Ducent^fimis et

hand word might be brought, and notice taken what was doing in every province,
he disposed along the rode highways, within small distance one from another;
first, certain young men as posts; and afterward swift wagons to give
intelligence. This he thought more commodious, and better to the purpose, that
they who from a place brought him letters might be asked questions also, if the
matters required ought.

50 In charters, patents, writs, bills and letters he used for his seal, at the
first, the image of ( a) SPHINX: Soon after, that of ALEXANDER the great: and

Of his clemency and civil ( a) courtesy, there be many, and those right

proofs and experiments. Not to reckon up, how many and who they were of the
adverse faction, that he vouchsafed pardon and life; yea, and suffered to hold
still a principal place in the City: he was content and thought it sufficient,
to punish IUNIUS NOVATUS and CASSIUS PATAVINUS, two commoners; the one with a
fine of money and the other with a slight banishment: notwithstanding that
IUNIUS NOVATUS in the name of young AGRIPPA had divulged a most biting and
stinging letter, touching him, and CASSIUS PATAVINUS at an open table and full
feast* gave out in broad terms, That he wanted neither hearty wishes nor good
will to stab him. Moreover in a certain judicial trial, when among other

accuser, and as if he had been sore offended, I would, quoth he, thou were
able to prove this unto me: In faith AELIANUS should well know that I also have
a tongue: for I will not stick to say more by him. And farther than this he
neither for the present nor afterward inquired into the matter. Likewise, when
TIBERIUS grieved and complained unto him of the same indignity in a letter, and
that uncessantly and after a violent manner, thus he wrote back again: D^e not

52 Albeit, he wist well enough, that Temples were usually granted by decree
even unto Proconsuls, yet in no Province accepted he of that honor, but
jointly in the name and behalf of himself and of Rome. For in Rome verily,
he forbear this honor most resolutely: yea, and those silver Statues which in
times past had been set up for him, he melted every one. With the money, for
which they were sold.

offered and instantly forced upon him the Dictatourship, he fell upon his

detestation of the thing, besought them not to urge him farther.

53 The name and title of Dom n^, or S^.

Lord: whereupon the whole assembly with great joy and applause accorded
thereto, as if they had been spoken of him: immediately both with gesture of

suffer himself to be called DOMINUS, no not of his own children and nephews
either in earnest or board. And that which more is, such fair and g^avering

answer, That every man had his own liking and judgment by himself. Yet for

Moreover, the diffamatory libels of him cast abroad and dispersed in the

he neither was affrighted at, nor took great care to refute; making not so
much as search after the Authors. Only this he opened, That from thence-forth

How much, and for what demerits of his, he was beloved, an easy matter it 57
is to make an aestimate. The acts and decrees of the Senate concerning his
honors I pass over, as which may be thought wrested from them either upon mere
necessity or bashful modesty. The Gentlemen of Rome of their own accord and
by an uniforme consent celebrated his birth feast always for 2 days to

they made, threw small pieces of brasse-coine into Into the railed or empaled

Calends of January every year they offered a newyeeres-gift in the Capitol
unto him, although he were absent. Out of which mass and gross sum he
disbursed as much money, as where with he bought the most precious Images of
the Gods, and dedicated them in diverse streets: as namely APOLLO In the

58 The Or addition A. V, C. 758

exceeding great and unexpected accord. The Commons, first, by an Embassage
which they sent unto Antium* then, because he accepted not thereof, at Rome as
he entered the Theater to be hold the plays, they tendered it a second time
themselves in great frequencie, dight with Laurel branches and Coronets. Soon
after, the Senate did the like, not by way of decree nor acclamation, but by
VALERIUS MESSALLA, who had commission from them all, to relate their minds in
this manner. THAT, quoth he, which may be to the good and happiness of thee and

Kings his friends and Confederates both severally every one in his own
kingdom built Cities calling them Caesareae, and jointly altogether intended,
at their common charges fully to finish the temple of Jupiter Olympicus at
Athens which long time before was begun, and to dedicate it unto his Genius.
And oftentimes, the said Princes leaving their realms, going in Roman
gowns, without Diadems and regal Ornaments, in habit and manner of devoted
Clients, performed their dutiful attendance unto him day by day: not at Rome
only, but also when he visited and travailed over the provinces.

For as much as I have showed already what his public carriage was in places 61
of Command and Magistracies: in the managing also and administration of the
Commonweal throughout the world both in war and peace: Now will I relate
his more private and domestical life: as also what behavior he A. V: C. 711:
745
showed and what fortune he had at home, and among his own, even from his
youth unto his dying day. His mother he buried during the time of his first
Consulship, and his sister OCTAVIA in the 54 year of his age. And as he had
performed unto them both, whiles they lived, the offices of piety and love in
the best manner: so when they were dead, he did them the greatest honors he
possibly could.

He had espoused, being a very youth, the daughter of P. SERVILIUS ISAURICUS: 62
but upon his reconciliation unto ANTONIE after their first discord at the
earnest demand of both their soldiers, that they might be conjoined and
united by some nere affinity, he took to wife (ANTONIUS) daughter in law
CLAUDIA, the natural daughter of Dame FULVIA by P. CLODIUS: a young Damsel,
scarce mariageable. And upon some displeasure, falling out with FULVIA his
wives mother, he put her away, as yet untouched and a virgin* Soon after, he
wedded SCRIBONIA, the wife before of two husbands, both men of Consular
dignity, and by one of them a mother. This wife also he divorced, not able to
endure, as he writes himself, her shrewd and perverse A: V. C: 715:
conditions: and forthwith, took perforce from TIBERIUS NERO, LIVIA DRUSILLA
his lawful wife and great with child. Her he loved entirely, her he liked
only, and to the very end.

Upon SCRIBONIA he begat IVLIA By LIVIA he had no issue, although 63
full feign he would. Conceive once she did by him; but she miscarried, and the
Infant was borne before time. As for IVLIA, he gave her in marriage first to
MARCELLUS the son of his sister OCTAVIA, even when he was but newly crept out
of his childs age. Afterward, when MARCELLUS was departed this life, he
bestowed her upon M. AGRIPPA, having by entreaty obtained of his sister, to
yield up unto him her right and interest in her son Her daughters husband:
in law. For, at the same time AGRIPPA had to wife one of the It seems the
younger:
MARCELLAE (her daughters) and of her body begotten children. When this AGRIPPA
was likewise dead, he cast about and sought for diverse matches a long time,
even out of the ranks of Roman Gentlemen, and chose for her, his wives son
Emperor after him.
TIBERIUS: whom he forced to put away a former wife then with child, and by
whom he had been a father already. M. ANTONIUS writes, that he had affianced
the said IVLIA first, to ANTONIE his son: and afterward to COTISO King of

64 By AGRIPPA and IULIA he had 3 nephews, CAIUS, LUCIUS, and 64
ARIPPA: nieces likewise twain, IULIA and AGRIPPINA. IULIA he bestowed in
marriage upon LUCIUS PAULUS, the Censors son: and AGRIPPINA upon GERMANICUS,
his (...), or (...)* his wives nephewe, and both true;
sisters ( a) Nephew. As for CAIUS and LUCIUS he adopted them for his own
children at home in his house, having bought them of AGRIPPA their Father by
the brazen coin Per (...), vel (...) as (...) ^bram.
and ( b) the balance. Whom being yet in their tender years, he employed in
the charge of the common weal: and no sooner were they Consuls Elect, but he
sent them abroad to the government of Provinces and conduct of armies. His
daughter and ^ces above named, he brought up and trained so, as that he
acquainted them with housewiferie, and set them even to card, spinne and make
cloth: forbidding them streighly either to say or do ought but openly in the
sight and hearing of all men, and that which might be recorded in their day Of

of strangers, that he wrote upon a time unto L. Or (...).

passed the bounds of modesty, in that he came once to Baiae for to see and

might imitate his handwritinge* He never supped together with them, but they

had them either goinge before in a Wagon, or else about him rydinge by his

But as jo^ous and confident as he was in regard both of his issewe, and also
of the discipline of his house, fortune failed him in the proof of all. His

than the reproachful misdemeauours of his children. For, at the infortunitie of
CAIUS and LUCIUS he was not extremely dismayed and cast down: mary, of his
daughter and her leawd pranckes, he gave notice in his absence to the Senate,
and that in writing, which his ( c) (...) red openly before them: and for very
shame he absented himself a long time and avoided the company of men: yea, and
that which more is, once he was of mind to put her to death. And verily, when
as, about the same time a freed woman of his named PHOEBE, one of them that
were privy to her naughtines, knit her own neck in a halter, and so ended her
days, he gave it out, that he wished with all his heart he had been * Phoebes
father. Confined thus when she was, he debarred her wholly the use of wine, and
all manner of delicate trimming and decking her body: neither would he
permit any man, one or other, bond, or free to have access unto her without
his privitie and leave asked: nor unless he might be certified before, of what
age, of what stature and color he was, yea and what ( a) marks and skars he

so straightly looked unto: For, to call her home again once for all, he could
by no means be entreated: as who, many a time when the people of Rome
besought him, earnestly and were very instant with him in her behalf, openly
before a frequent assembly of them cursed such daughters and such wives: saying
God bless ye al from the like. The infant that his niece IVLIA bare after she
was condemned, he forbad expressly to take knowledge of, and to give it the
rearing. As touching his nephew AGRIP^A seeing him to prove nothing more
tractable, but rather brain sick every day more than other, he transported
him (from Surrentum) into an Island and enclosed him there, besides with a guard
of soldiers. He provided also by an Act of the Senate, that in the same place
he should be kept forever. And so often, as there was any mention made either
of him or his ij. Daughter ^: neice.

into this speech.

and kept the same most constantly; not honoring only the virtues and deserts of

according to their worth, but enduring also their vices and deliquences at
least wise if they exceeded not: for out of all that number of his depe^dants
there will hardly be any found, during his friendship to have bin plunged in
adversity and thereby overthrown: except SALVIDIENVS RUFUS whom he had before
advanced to the dignity of Consul; and CORNELIUS GALLVS promoted by him to the
pro vostship of Egypt, raised both from the very dunghill. The one of these
for pra ctising seditiously an alteration in the state: and the other for his
unthankeful and A, V. C, 714. 728,
mal^tious mind, he forbad his house and all his provinces. But as for GALLVS,
when as both by the menaces of his accusers, and also by the rigorous Acts of
the Senate passed against him, he was driven to shorten his own life: AUGUSTUS
co^me^ded verily their kind hearts to him for being so wroth and grieuing so
much in his behalf: howbeit for GALLVS sake he wept, and complained of his
own hard fortune, in that he alone might not be angry, with his friends,
within that measure as he would himself: all the rest of his favorites
flowrished in power and wealth to their lives end, as chief persons every one
in their rank: notwithstanding some coffeehouse and mislikes came between.
For otherwhiles, he found a want in M. AGRIPPA of patience, and in MAECENAS of
Taciturnitie and secrecy; when as the M. Agrippa:

his friends, as well dead as living. For although he was none of these that lie

weighed he most strictly and precisely the Final or last.
supreme judgments and testimonies of his friends concerning him, delivered at
their deaths: as on who dissimuled neither his grief in case a man respected
him slightly and without honorable terms; nor his joy, if he remembered him
thankfully and with kindness. As touching either legacies or parts of heritages,
as also portions left unto him by any parents whatsoever, his manner was either
out of hand to part with the same unto their children, or if they were in their
minority, to restore all unto them with the increase, upon the day that they
put on their virile gowns, or else whereon they married.

A patron he was (to his freedmen) and a May. (to his bondservants) no less

severe, than gracious and gentle* Many of his enfranchised men he highly
honored and employed especially: by name, LICINIVS ENCELADVS, with others. His
servant COSMVS, who thought and spoke most hardly of him, he proceeded to
chastise no farther, than with hanging a pair of fetters at his heels: As for
Diomedes his Steward, who walking together with him, by occasion of a wild Bore
running full upon them, for very fear put his May, between himself and the
Beast, he imputed unto him rather timiditie, then to be any fault else: and
although it were a matter of noe small peril, yet because there was noe

In the Prime and flower of his youth he incurred sundry ways the infamous
note of a vicious and wanton life. Sext. POMPEIUS railed upon him as an
effeminate person. M. ANTONIUS laid to his charge, that he earned his unkles
adoption, by suffering the filthy abuse of his body: Semblably, LUCIVS brother
to the said MARCUS enveied against him, as if he had abandoned and prostituted
his youth (deflowred and tasted first by CAESAR) unto A. HI^TIVS also in Spain

also that he put away His own wife.
SCRIBONIA, because she was too plain and round with him, upon grief she
took, that a Concubine was so great and might do so much with him: as also
that there were bargains and matches sought out for him by his friends, upon

years, all naked, as if TORAVIVS the baud were a selling of them: Moreover he
writes thus much to himself, after a familiar sort, as yet being not fallen

Moreover, much talk there was abroad, of a certain supper of his more 70
secret, ywis then the rest, and which was commonly called * ( a) Dodecatheos:
At which, that their sat guests in habit of Gods and goddesses, and himself
among the^ adorned instead of Apollo: not only the letters of ANTONIE, who
rehearsed most bitterly the names of every one do lay in his reproach, but also
these verses without an author so vulgarly known and rife in every man's mouth:

The rumor of this supper was increased by the exceeding dearth and famine at
that time in Rome: and the very next morrow, there was set up this cry and note
within the City. That the Gods had eaten up all the Corn: and that CAESAR
was become (...), al^ beds or, T^olos, S^utcheons in ^tecture.
Apollo in deed, but yet Apollo the ( a) tortor: under which surname that God
was worshipped in one place of the City. Furthermore, taxed he was for his
greedy grasping after precious house furniture and costly Corinthian Vessels:
as also for giving himself much to dice play. For, as in time of the
proscription, there was written over his statue; Pater Argentarius, Ego
Corinthiarius. * Not counterfaite as at the supper overnight.


My father was a Banking-monie changer,
And I am now a Corinth-Vessell-munger.
Because it was thought he procured some to be put into the bill of those that
were proscribed, even for the love of their Corinthian-Vesselles: so
afterward, during the Sicilian war, this Epigrame of him went current
abroad.

Postquam bisclasse victus naues perdidit.
Aliquando ut vincat, ludit assidue aleam.
Since time he lost his ships at Sea in fight defaited twice;
That win he may sometime, he plays continually at dice.
Of these criminous imputations or malicious slanders (I wot not whether) 71
the infamy of his unnatuall uncleanness he checked and confuted most easily
by his chaste life both at the present and afterward. Semblably the invidious
opinion of his excessive, and sumpteous furniture: considering, that when he
had by force won ALEXANDRIA, he retained for himself out of all the kings
household stuff and rich Implements, no more but on cup of the precious stone
Or Murrha. The (...)
Myrrh^* and soon after, all the brazen vessels which were of most use, he
melted every one. Mary for fleshly lust otherwise and wantonness with women he
went not clear, but was blotted therewith. For afterward, also as the report
goes; he gave himself overmuch to the deflowring of young maids whom his
wife sought out for him from all places. As for the rumor that ran of his
diceplaying he bashed no whit thereat* and he played simply without Art and
openly for his disport, even when he was well stricken in years: and besides
the month ( a) December, upon other play days also, yea and work days too.
Neither is there any doubt to be made thereof. For in a certain Epistle
written with his own hand: I supped, quoth he, my Tiberius with the same men:

part, lost 20000. Sesterces in mine own name: but it was when I had been over

daughter thus he writes, I have sent unto you 250. deniers: just so many as I
had given to ^y guests a piece, if they would have played together in supper
time either at cockeall, or at even and odd. For the rest of his life,
certain it is, that in every respect he was most continent, and without
suspicion of any vice.

He dwelt at first, hard by the Forum of Rome above the winding stairs 72
ANULARIAE, in an house which had been CALVUS the Orators: Afterward in the
mount Palatium: howbeit in a mean habitation, belonging sometime to
HORTENSIVS, and neither for spacious receite nor stately setting out, and trim
furniture, conspicuous: as wherein the galleries were but short, standing upon
pillars made of (soft) Albane stone: and the Refection Roumes without any
marble or beavtifull pavements. For the space of 40. years and more, he kept
on bedchamber winter and summer: and albeit he found by experience the City
not very wholesome in the winter for his health, yet continually he wintred
there: If he purposed at any time to do ought secretly, and without
interruption: he had a special room alone by it self aloft which he called
( a) Syracusae. Or Techn^phyon:
Hither would he withdraw himself orderly, or else make a step to some
Country house near the City, of one of his Libertines. Was he sick at any
time? Then he used to lie in MAECENAS his house. Of all his retyring places of
pleasure, he frequented these especially, that stood along the Maritime tract,
and the Isles of Campania; or else the towns nere adjoining to the City of
Rome, to wit, Lanuvium, Praeneste and Tibur: where also within the Porches of
Hercules Temple, he sat very often to minister justice. Large palaces and full
of curious works he misliked: And verily, those that were sumpteously built

lightly any apparel but of huswifes cloth, made within house; by his wife, his
sister, his daughter and neipces. His gowns were neither straight and skant,
nor yet, wide and large. His Senators robe neither with overbroad studs of
purple guarded, nor with narrow. His shoes underlaide somewhat with the
highest, that he might seem taller than he was. As for the raiment which he
used abroad, and his shoes, he had them at all times laid ready within his

Spy of his. He came to the bourde himself when he made a feast, sometimes
very late, and otherwhiles left the same as soon: and then his guests would
both fall to their suppers before he sat down,, and also continued sitting
still after he was gone. The suppers he made consisted ordinarily of three

expenses, otherwhiles with mirth and sport only: At the Saturnalia, and at
other times when it pleased him, he used to send abroad as his gifts,

pieces current in the Kings days, and strange coins; sometime nothing but

and to tender blind bargains unto them also of painted Tables, with the
wrong side outward, and so by uncertain venturinge upon their hap, either
to frustrate and disappoint, or fully to satisfy the hope of the Chapmen: yet
so, as the cheapninge of the thing should always pass through every bourde,
and the loss or gain grow to them all as common,

with the hand, and green figs especially of that kind which bear twice a

retchlesse neglect of diet, he used diverse times to take his supper alone,
either before his other guests were set and fell to meat, or else after all
was taken away, and they risen: whereas, at a full bourd he would not touch a

77 He was by nature also a very small drinker of wine. CORNELIUS NEPOS
reports of him, that his usual manner was during the time he lay encamped
before Mutina to drink at a supper not above thrice. Afterward, whenever
he drank most liberally he passed not Ex hac in observanti^, vol, ex ^ac

78 After his noones repast he used to take his repose, and to sleep a while,
in his clothes as he was, with his shoes ( a) on, stretching ( b) out his
feet, and holding his hand before his eyes. After supper he retired himself
into a little Closet ( c) or Study. And there continued he by a candle far
in the night, even until he had dispatched the rest of that days business,
either all or the most part. From thence, he went directly to his bed: Where,
he slept at the most not above seven hours: and those verily not together

catch a sleep again, and draw the same out often after day-breake. Neither
would he ever lie awake without one sitting by his beds side. Much offended he
was with want of sleep (or waking) early in a morning: and if he were to be
awakened sooner than ordinary, either about some worldly affairs of his
friends, or service of the Gods, because he would not prejudice thereby his
own good or health; he used to stay in some of his familiar friends upper
rooms and loft, next to the place where his occasions lay. And even so, many a
time for want of sleep, both as he was carried through the streets, and also
when his licter was set down, he would between whiles take a nap and make
some stay.

79 He was of an excellent presence and personage, and the same throughout all
the degrees of his age most lovely and amiable; negligent though he were in
all manner of pikednesse, for combing and trimming of his head so careless, as
that he would use at once many Barbers, such as came next hand, it skilled not
whom: and one while he clipped, another while he shaved his beard; and yet at
the very same time, he either read, or else wrote somewhat. His visage and
countenance, whether he spoke or held his peace, was so mild, so pleasant and
lightsome, that one of the Nobles and Potentates of Gaul; confessed unto his
Countrymen, he was thereby only stayed and reclaimed, that he did not
approach near unto him, under color of conference as he passed over the
Alps, and so shove him down from a steep cragge to break his neck, as his
full intent was. He had a pair of clear and shining eyes: wherein also, (as
he would have made men believe) was seated a kind of Divine vigor: and he
ioyed much, if a man looking wistly upon him held down his face, as it were
against the brightness of the Sun. But in his old age he saw not very well
with the left eye. His teeth grew thin in his head, and the same were small

and withal of a light yellowe color. His eyebrows met together: his ears

writes in the History of his life, that he was five foot ( a) and nine
inches high). But as low as the same was, the proportionable making and
feature of his limbs hid it so, as it might not be perceived, unless he were
compared with some taller person than himself standing by.

to any writing, with the help of an hoope and finger stall of horn. He
complained also of the grief in his ( d) bladder, but voiding at length little
gravell-stones by urine, he was eased of that pain.

81 All his life time he tasted of certain grievous and dangerous
sicknesses, but especially after the subduing of CANTABRIA: what time, by
reason of his liver diseased and corrupted by Destillations, he was driven to
some extremity: and thereby of necessity entered into a contrary ( a) and
desperate course of Physic: For, seeing that hot fomentations did him no
good, forced he was by the direction and counsel of ANTONIUS MUSA his

lapped also about the ( a) thighs and legs. During Summer he lay with his

went from Rome but to Tibu^ ( a) or Preneste, he would make two days of it.

Eloquence, and other liberal professions he exercised from his very childhood
right willingly, and therein took exceeding great pains. During the 84
war at Mutina, notwithstanding that huge heap of affairs and occurrents,
(by report) he read, he wrote, he declaimed every day. For afterward, neither
in the Senate House, nor before the people, ne yet to his soldiers made he
ever speech, but it was premeditate and composed before: albeit he wanted not
the gift to speak of a sudden and ex tempore. Now, for fear least his
memory at any time should fail him, least also he might spend too much time
in learning by rote, he began to read and rehearse all out of his written
copy. His very speeches also with folk by themselves, even with LIVIA his
wife about any grave and serious matters were never but penned and put down in
writing* out of which he would rehearse the same, that he might not speak
otherwise ex ^empore or less than was meet. His pronunciation and utterance

continually he used the help of a Phonascus to moderate his voice: but

Many compositions he made in prose, of sundry arguments. Of which he 85
would read some in a meeting of his familiars, as it were in an Auditorie* as

he dealt in it but superficially. One Treatise there is extant written by him
in Hexametre verses, The argument whereof, is Sicilie, and so it is entitled.
There is another book also, as little as it, of Epigrammes: which for the most
part he studied upon and devised whiles he was in the Baines. For, having in
a great and ardent heat begun a Called Ajax.

86 The Eloquence that he followed was of an Elegant and temperate kind:
wherein he avoided unapt and unfit Sentences, as also the stinking savours, as
himself says, of dark and obscure words: but took especial care how to
express his mind and meaning most plainly and evidently. For the better
effecting whereof, and because he would not in any place trouble and stay
reader or hearer, he stuck not either to put Prepositions unto Verbes, or to
iterate Conjunctions very often: which being taken away breed some obscurity,
although they yield a greater grace. As for those that affect ( a) new-made
words, such also as use old terms past date, he loathed and rejected alike,
as faulty, both the sorts of them in a contrary kind. Those he shook up
diverse times, but especially his friend MAECENAS, whose ( b) Murobrecheis

were frantic, for writing that which men may rather wonder at, than under

kind of eloquence by himself, he added thus much moreover. And are you in

down by Grammarians, he did not so much observe: but seems to follow their
opinion rather, who think, Men should write according as they speak. For,
whereas oftentimes he either exchangeth or leaves clean out, not letters
only but syllables also, that is a common error among men. Neither would I
note thus much, but that it seems strange unto me, which some have written
of him, namely, That he substituted another, in the place of a Consulare

Neither verily was he less in love with the study of Greek literature: For,
89
even therein also he highly excelled, as having been brought up and taught
under the professed Rhetorician Apollodorus of Pergamus. Whom being now very
aged, himself as yet but young had forth of Rome with him to Apollonia.
Afterward, also when he was well furnished with variety of erudition and
learning of ( a) SPHAERUS; he entered into familiar acquaintance, with AREUS the
Philosopher and his two sons, DRONYSIUS and NICANOR: yet so, as for all that
he neither could speak readily, nor durst compose any In Greek:
thing. For if occasion required ought, he drew it in Latin, and gave it unto
another for to be translated into Greek. And, as he was not altogether
unskilful in Poemes, so he took delight even in the ( b) old Comoedie also,
which he exhibited oftentimes to be acted in public solemnities. In reading
over and perusing Authors of both Languages, he sought after nothing so much
as wholesome precepts and examples, serving to public or private use: and
those, when he had gathered out of them word for word, he sent either to his
inward friends and domestical Servitours, or to the Commanders of armies and
Governors of Provinces: or else for the most part to the Magistrates of the
City, according as any of them needed admonition. Moreover, whole books he
both read from one end to the other unto the Senate, and also published
oftentimes to the people by proclamation: as namely, the Orations of Q. ( c)
METELLUS touching the propagation and multiplying of children: those likewise
of RUTILIUS concerning the model As well to cut of the expenses of sumpteous aed
fices as to prevent danger by Skare-fires.
and form of buildings: thereby the rather to persuade them, That he was not
the first that looked into both these matters, but that their forefathers in
old time had even then a care and regard thereof. The fine wits flourishing in
his days he cherished by all means possible. Such as rehearsed before him
their Compositions he gave audience unto, courteously and with patience:
notonely verses and histories, but Which were not so usually red and rehearsed
in open audience.
orations also and dialogues. Mary, if anything were written of himself,
unless it were done with serious gravity and by the best, he took offense
thereat; and gave the Praetours in charge not to suffer his name to be made
vulgar and stale, in the trivial contentions (of Orators, Poets, etc) when
they were matched one with another.

For Religious scrupulosity and Superstition, thus by heere-say he stood 90
affected. Thunder and Lightning he was much affraide of: in so much as
always and in every place, he carried about him for a preservative remedy a
Or of a sea calfe, which as Pliny writes checketh all lightnings:
Seals skin: yea, and whenever he suspected there would be any
extraordinary storm or tempest, he would retire himself into a close secret
room under ( a) ground, and vaulted above head: Which he did, because once in
times past, he had been frighted with a flash of lightning, crossing him in
his journey by night; as we have before related.

As for dreams, neither his own, nor other men's of himself, he neglected. 91

by reason of sickness, yet went he forth, warned so to do by the dream of

forced and won by the enemies, his licter was in that concurse of theirs
stabbed through and all to rent and torn, as if he had remained there behind
lying sick. Himself every spring was wont to see many visions most fearful,
but the same proved vain illusions and to no purpose: at other times of the
year he dreamed not so often, but yet to more effect. When as he ordinarily
frequented the temple dedicated to JUPITER, the Thunderet in the Capitol, he
dreamed that JUPITER CAPITOLINUS complained, How his worshippers were taken
from him perforce: and That he answered, He had placed Thundering JUPITER

called Asses.

Certain foretokens and ominous signs he observed as unfallible presages, 92
to wit, if in a morning his shoes were put one wrong, and namely, the left
for the right, he held it unluckie: Again, when he was to take any long
journey by land or sea, if it chanced to mizzle of rain, he took that for a
luckie sign betokening a speedy and prosperous return. But moved he was
especially with uncouth and supernatural sights. There happened a date tree to
spring forth between the very joincts of the stones before his door, which he
remooved and transplanted in the inward court of his domestical Wherein they
stood,

much that in the Island Capreae, the boughs of a very old holmetree hanging and
drouping now for age down to the ground, became fresh again at his coming
thither, that he would needs make an exchang with the State of Naples, and in
liev of that Island geve them AENARIA. Certain days also he precisely
observed: as for example: he would not take a journey any whither, the day
after the ( a) Nundinae: nor begin any serious matter upon the Nones of a
Month: Herein verily avoiding and eschewing naught ese, as he writes unto
TIBERIUS, but the unluckie Dusphemian nominis:

Of foraine ceremonies and religions, as he entertained with all reverence 93
those that were ancient, and whereof he conceived good reason: so he
despised the rest. For having been instituted and professed (in the sacred
mysteries of CERES) at Athens, when afterward he sat judicially upon the
Tribunal at Rome to here and determine a controversy as touching the
privilege of CERES priests in Attica, and perceived that certain points of
great secrecy were proposed there to be debated: he dismissed the assembly
and multitude of people standing all about in the Court, and himself alone
heard them plead the cause; But contrariwise, not only when he road in
visitation all over Egypt, himself forbore to turn a little out of his way
for to see ( a) Apis, but also commended his nephew CAIUS, because in ryding

far, it would not be impertinent to annex hereto, what befell unto him
before he was borne? What happened 94
upon his very birth day? And what presently ensued thereupon? Whereby, that
future greatness and perpetual felicity of his, might be hoped for and
observed. At velitre, part of the (Town) wall in old time had been blasted
by lightening: upon which occasion, answer was given by ORACLE, that a
Citizen of that Town should one day be ruler of the world. The Velitrines, in
confidence hereof, both then immediately, and afterward also, many a time
warred with the people of Rome, even well near to their own final ruin and
destruction. At length (though late it was) by good proofs and evidences it
appeared that the said strange accident, portended the mighty power of
AVOVSTVS. IVLIUS MARATHVS reports, that some six months before AUGUSTUS
Nativitie, there happened at Rome a prodigy publicly known, whereby
foreshewed and denounced it was, That nature was about to bring forth a King (
a) over the people of Rome, at which the Senate being affrighted made an Act,
That no man child that year borne should be reared and brought up. But they
whose wives then, were great bellied (for every one was ready to draw the
hope unto himself,) took order, That the said Act, of the Senate should not
be brought into the City Chamber and there enrolled. I read in the books of
ASCLEPIADES or Mendesius bearing the name of the City Mendes in Egypt.
Mendes entitled Theologoumenon, Of divine discourses.
How ATIA, being come at midnight to celebrate the solemn sacrifice and
divine service of Apollo, whilst other dames slept, fell fast a sleep also;
and suddenly a ( b) serpent crept close unto her, and soon after went forth
from her: She therewith being awakened purified her self, as she would have
done upon her husbands company with her; and presently there arose to be
seen upon her body a certain mark or specke representing the picture of a
serpent, which never after could be gotten out: in so much as immediately
thereupon she forbore the public baines for ever: Also, how in the x. month
after, she was delivered of AUGUSTUS: and for this cause he was reputed to be
the son of Apollo. The same ATIA, before she was brought to bed of him,
dreamed that her entrails were heaved up to the stars, and there stretched
forth and spread all over the compass of earth and heaven. His father OCTAVIUS
likewise dreamed, that out of the womb of ATIA; there arose the shining beams
of the Sun. The very day on which he was borne, what time as the conspiracy of

of bread out of his hand as he took his dinner within a pleasant grove: and
when he had mounted up a very great height, came gently down of a sudden
again and restored unto him the same: Q. CATVLVS after the dedication of the
Capitol dreamed two nights together: In the former. him thought, that Jupiter
Optimus Maximus: Whiles many young boys, Noble men's sons, were playing about
his Alter, severed one of them from the rest and bestowed in his bosom the
public broad ( c) Seal of the Or Ci^
State to carry in his hand. And the next night followinge he saw in another
dream the same boy in the bosom of Jupiter CAPITOLINVS: Whom when he
commanded to be pulled from thence, prohibited he was by the admonition of
the God, as if the same boy should be brought up for the defense and tuition of
the Commonweal: Now the morrow after, chauncing to meet with (young)
AUGUSTUS, (whom erst he had not known before,) he beheld him wistly not
without great admiration, and withal openly gave it out, That he was for all
the world like unto that boy of whom he dreamed. Some tell the former dream
of CATVLVS otherwise: as if Jupiter, (when as a number of those boys required
of him a Tutor) pointed out one of them, unto whom they should refer all
their desires: and so lightly touching his lips, and taking as it were an
assay thereof with his fingers, brought that kiss back to his own mouth; M.
CICERO having accompanied CAIUS CAESAR into the Capitol, happened to report
unto his familiar friends the dream he had the night before: namely how a
boy of an ingenious face and countenance, was let down from heaven by a golden
Chain, and stood at the door of the Capitol, unto whom Jupiter delivered a
( d) whip: Hereuppon espying at unawares (little) AVGVTVS whom (as yet
altogether unknown to most men) his Uncle CAESAR had sent for to the sacrifice,
he avouched plainly, that this boy was very he, whose Image was represented
unto him in a vision as he lay a sleep. When he was putting on his virile

shadowed their stock: yea and * doves haunted the same, therein to nestle and
breed. notwithstanding that kind of bird cannot of all others away with any

anon conceived so great a confidence in his fortunes, that he divulged his
Horoscope and the ascendent of his Nativity: yea and also stamped a piece of
silver coin, with the mark of the Celestial sign Capricornus, under which
figure and Constellation he was borne.

After CAESAR'S death, being returned from Apollonia, as he entered Rome 95

round coronet in form of a rain bow compassed the circle of the Sun, and
therewith soon after, the monument of IVLIA, CAESAR'S daughter was smitten with

lay at his feeet. At Acti^m, as he was going down to fight the battle,
there met him in the way an Ass with his driver, the man's name was ( b)
EVTYCHVS, and the beasts Nicon: After victory obtained, he set uppe the
Images of them both in brass, within that Temple, into which he converted the
very place where he encamped.

His death also (whereof from hence forth I will write) and his deification 97
after death was known before by many signs most evident, when he had taken
a review of the City; and was about the solemn Called Lustr^

to be made until the next ( a) Lustrum, he commanded his colleague TIBERIUS to

containing them were now written and in readiness, yet denied he to undertake
those vows which he should never pay. About the same time the first C* in

letter of his own name, upon a flash and stroke of lightening went quite out
of the Inscription that stood upon his statue: Answer was made by the
Soothsaiers, that he was to live but just one hundred days after: which number
that letter did betoken; And that it would come to pass that he should be
Canonized and registered among the Gods, because AESAR, the residue of the name
CAESAR, in the Tuskane Language signified God. Being about therefore to send
TI^IVS away into Illyricum and to company him as far as Beneventum, when
diverse suitors, for one cause or other interrupted him, yea and detained him
about hearing and determining matters iudicially, he cried out alowd (which
also within a while was reckened For Ast^ra was a water town with a river also
of that name running by it
as a pr^saging osse,) That were he once out of Rome, he would never after be
there again what occasion soever might make him stay. And so being entered
upon his journie he went forward as far as to Astura: and so presently from
thence (contrary ( c) to his usual manner,) with the benefit of a forewind and
gentle gale * took water by night and sailed over.

The cause of his sickness he caught by a flux of the belly. And for that 98
time having coasted Campanie and made circuit about the Islands next adjoining,
he bestowed also four days within a retiring place of pleasure at Capre^:
where he gave his mind to all ease and courteous affability. It happened as
he passed by the Bay of Puteoli, certain passengers and soldiers out of a
ship ( a) of ALEXANDRIA, which then was newly arrived, all clad in white, dight
also with garlands, and burning frankincense, had heaped upon him all good and
fortunate words, chaunting his singular praises in these terms. That by him
they lived, by him they sailed, by him they enjoyed their freedom, and all the
riches they had. At which, he took great contentment and was cheered at the
heart; Insomuch as thereupon he divided to every one of his train about him
40, ( b) pieces of gold, but he required an oath again and assurance of each
one, that they should not lay out that money otherwise than in buying the wares
( c) and commodities of ALEXANDRIA. For certain days together that remained,
among diverse and sundry gifts, he distributed among them over and above,
gowns and clokes, with this condition, that Romans should use the Greekish
habit and speak likewise Greek; the Greeks also wear Roman attire and
use their language. He beheld also continually the youths exercising
themselves (of whom their remained yet some store at Capreae) according to the
of the greek who sometime inhabited those parts.
ancient custom. And even unto them he made a feast in his own sight,
permitting them or rather exacting of them, their old liberty of sporting, of
snatching appels and cates, and of sk^mbling for such small gifts and favors
as were sent or skattered abroad. In one word, he forbear no manner of mirth
and pastime. The Isle ( d) hard by Capreae, he called Apragopolis, of the
Idleness of such as out of his train retired themselves thither. But one of
his beloved minions named ( f) MASGA^AS, he had wont merrily to call (...), as
one would say, The fo^der of that Island. The sepulcher of this MASGA^AS (who
died a year before) when he perceived one time out of his dining chamber to be

THE HISTORY OF Tiberius Nero Caesar,
written by Caius Suetonius Tranquillus.


THe Patritian family CLAUDIA (for, there was likewise 1
another Plebeian of that name, neither in power nor dignity inferior) had the
first beginning out of Or Regil^.
Regillum a Town of the Sabines. From thence they came with a great retinue of
vassals to Rome newly founded, there to dwell: induced thereto by the counsel
of T. TATIUS fellow in government of the kingdom with ROMULUS; or (which is
the more received opinion) through the persuasion of ( a) ATTA Or Cla^
CLAUDIUS, a principal person of that house, about the 6 year after the kings
were expelled and so, by the Senators of Rome; raunged they were among the
Patritij. Upon this, soon after, they received by virtue of a grant from the
whole City, for their Clients and vassals, lands to occupy beyond the river
Anio: and for themselves a Locum. Some read lucum, not in the strict
signification of a sacred Grove, but of a pleasant tuft of trees wherewith
monuments were beautified: as you may gather by the Mausoleum of Augustus.
place of sepulture under the Capitol: and so forth, in process of time
obtained 28 Consulates, five Dictatures, Censures seven, Triumphs six, and
two Ovations. This family being distinguished by sundry fore-names and surnames
both, in a general consent rejected the fore-name of LUCIUS, after that two of
their lineage bearing that name were convict, the one of robbery, the other of
murder. Among surnames it assumed the addition of ( b) NERO, which in the
Sabine tongue signifies Strong or stout.

all the CLAUDII, excepting only that P. CLODIUS who for expelling CICERO out
of Rome, suffered himself to be adopted by a * Commoner and one younger ( a)
also than himself, were always Optimates, the only maintainers or patrons of
the dignity and power of the Patritians: yea, and in opposition of the Commons
so violent, stubborn and selfe-willed that not one of them, although he stood
upon his trial for life and death before the people, could find in his heart
so much as to change his ( e) weed, or to crave any favor at their hands.

DRVSVS, upon the killing of one DRAVSVS the General of his enemies in close
combat and single fight, purchased unto himself and his posterity after him
that surname. It is reported also that this DRVSVS being A. V. C. 471

heart, that he was not immediately admitted to the presence of SEXTUS POMPEIUS,
but debarred the use of his ( a) Knitches of rods to be borne before him, he
crossed the Seas into Achaia, and went to M. ANTONIUS. With whom, by occasion
that shortly after, an atonement and peace was made between all parties, he
returned to Rome; and at the request of AUGUSTUS, yielded unto him his own
wife LIVIA DRUSILLA, who both at that time was great with child, and also had
already before brought him a son named TIBERIUS, in his own house. Not long
after, he departed this life, and left his children surviving him, namely
TIBERIUS NERO and DRUSUS NERO.

necessity of the time required, did their best to ease the poor women of their
burden and load. He was carried away with them likewise through Sicilie and
Achaia: yea, and being recommended to the Lacedaemonians (who were under the
protection of the CLAUDII their Patrones) for to take the charge of him in
public, as he departed from thence by night, he was in danger of his life
by reason of a light flaming fire, which suddenly from all parts arose out of
a wood: and compassed all the company in his train so; as that some part of
LIVIAES apparel and the hair of her head was scorched and sienged therewith.

studds and bosses of gold, continue and are yet showed to be seen at Baie.
After his return into the City of Rome, being adopted by M. GALLIVS a
Senator in his last will and testament, he accepted of the inheritance and
entered upon it: but within a while forbear the name, because GALLIVS had sided
with the adverse faction and taken part against AUGUSTUS. Being 9. years old

had a mind and fancy unto him whiles she was the wife of a former husband.
Which verily was thought also abroad. But as he grieved, that after the
divorce he had driven away AGRIPPINA, so when he chanced but once (as she
met him) to see her, he followed her still with his eyes so bent, so

before it all the way on foot.

In his first rudiments and beginnings of civil offices, he pleaded at the 8
bar in defense of Archelans; of the Trallians and Thessalians: all of them
in sundry causes whiles AUGUSTUS sat in judgment to here their trial: In
the behalf also of the La^dicenes, Thyaterenes and Chians, who had suffered
great loss by Earthquake, and humbly sought for relief, he entreated the
Senate. As for FANNIVS CAEPIO. who together with VARRO MVRAENA had conspired

conduct of an army into the East parts, he restored the kingdom of ARMENIA
unto TIGRANES, and from the Tribunal seat did put the Diadem upon his head.
He recovered also those military ensigns which the Parthians had taken from
M. CRASSVS. After this he governed as Regent that part of Gaul beyond the
Alps, called Comata: which was full of troubles, partly by the incursions of
barbarous nations, and in part through the intestine discord of Princes and
Nobles of the Country. Then, warred he upon the Rhetians and Vindelici, and
so forward upon the Pannonians and Germans (whom he vanquished all). In
the Rhaetian and Vindelicke wars, he subdued the Nations inhabiting the
Alps: in the Pannonian, he conquered the Breuci and Dalmatians. In the
German war he brought over into Gaul 40000* that yielded unto him, and
placed them near unto the Rhene bank, where they had there habitations
assigned. For, which Acts, he entered the City of Rome both Ovant (ryding on

kind of honor and never granted to any man before: To bear Magistracy he
both began betimes, and also ran through them all in manner joynctly

space between he became Consul a second time, yea and also received the
Tribunitian Authority for five years together:

to depart: neither gave he any ear to his own mother humbly beseeching him
to stay; nor to his father in law, who complained also that he should be
forsaken thereby and left desolate in the Senate. Moreover; when they were
instant still to hold him back, he abstained from all kind of meat four
days together. At length having obtained leave to be gone, he left his wife
and son behind him at Rome, and forthwith went down to Ostia: giving not so
much as one word again to any that accompanied him thither, and kissing very
few of them at the parting.

As he sailed from Ostia along the coast of Campanie, upon news that he 11
heard of AUGUSTUS weakness, he stayed a while and went not forward: but when
a rumor began to be spread of him, (as if he lingered there, waiting some
opportunity of greater hopes,) he made noe more ado, but even against wind
and wether sailed through and passed over to Rhodes: having taken a delight to
the pleasant and healthful situation of that Island, ever since he arrived
there in his return from Armenia. Contenting himself here, with a mean and
small habitation, with a ferme house likewise by the City side not much
larger nor of greater receite, he purposed to lead a very civil and private

Whereupon; all the lazars and diseased persons were by commandment brought
into a public porch or gallerie and placed there in order according to the
sundry sorts of their maladies. At which unexpected sight, being much troubled
and perplexed, he wist not for a good while what to do? how* beit he went round
about from one to another, excusing himself for this that was done even to the
meanest, poorest and basest of them all This only thing and nothing else
beside was noted, wherein he seemed to exercise the power of his Tribunes
authority. Being daily and continually conversant about the Schools and
Auditories of professors, by occasion that there arose a great braule among
the (...).
Sophisters opposite in arguing cases and declaiming one against other, there
chanced to be one who perceiving him coming between and inclining to
favorize one part above the other; rayled bitterly at him. With drawing
himself therefore by little and little, and re^yring home to his house, he
came forth suddenly again and appeared with his Lictours: where he cited by
the voice of his crier to appear judicially before his Tribunal, that foul
mouthed railing fellow, and so commanded him to be had away to prison. After
this, he had certain intelligence given him that IVLIA his wife was convict
and condemned for her incontinencie and adulteries; also that in his name (by a
warrant directed from AUGUSTUS) she had a bill of divorse sent unto her. And
albeit, he was glad of these tidings, yet he thought it his part, as much as
lay in him, by many letters to reconcile the father unto his daughter: yea and
how ever she had deserved badly at his hands, yet to suffer her for to have
whatsoever he had at any time given unto her in free gift. Now, after he had
passed through the time of his Tribunes authority, and A. V. C. 752
confessed at last, that by this retyring of his out of the way he sought to
avoid naught else but the suspicion of Jealousy and emulation with CAIUS and
LUCIUS: he made suite, That seeing he was now secured in this behalf, and
they strengthened enough and able with ease to manage and maintain the second
place in government, he might be permitted to return and see his friends and
acquaintance again, whose presence he missed and longed after. But he could
not obtain so much: nay, admonished he was and warned before hand, to lay a
side all regard of his friends and kinsfolk, whom he was so willing to leave
and abandon before.

He abode therefore still at Rhodes, even against his will: and hardly by the
12
means and intercession of his own mother wrought thus much, that for to
cover his ignominy and shame, he might be absent under this pretense, as if he
were AUGUSTUS his Lieutenant. And then verily, lived he not only private to
himself, but also exposed to danger, and in great fear of some hard measure:
lying close and hidden in the uplandish and inward parts of the Island: and
avoiding the offices of them that made sail by those coasts, who had
frequented him continually: For as much as no man went into any province that
way, as Lord General or As Prator, propr^tor, proconsul, etc:
Magistrate, but he struck a side and turned to Rhodes. Besides, other causes
there were of greater fear and trouble presented unto him. For when as he
crossed the seas to Samos for to visit CAIUS, The son of his wife Iulia by
Agrippa,
his wives son, president of the East parts, he perceived him to be more
estranged than before time through the slanders and criminous imputations
which M. LOLLIVS companion and governor to the said CAIUS had put into his
head. He was drawn also into suspicion by certain CENTVRIONS, whom his favor
had advanced, and who at the day limited in their pasport were returned to the
camp, That he had delivered unto many Or of his friends.
( of them) MANDATES of an ambiguous and duple construction, such as might
seem to sound the minds of every one and solicit them to rebellion. Of
which suspicion being certified by AUGUSTUS, he never rested to call for, and
require to have some one of any degree and order what soever, to observe all
his deeds and words.

He neglected also his wonted exercises of horse and armor: yea and having 13

slippers. In such a state and condition as this, continued he almost two
years throughout, more despised and hateful every day then other: insomuch
as the Meniansians overthrew his Images and statues and upon a time, at a
certain feast, where familiar friends were met together (by occasion that
mention was made of him,) there was one stood up who promised CAIUS, That in
case he did but command and say the word, he would immediately sail to Rhodes
and fetch unto him the head of that exiled person: For so was he commonly
called. And chiefly upon this which was now no bare fear, but plain peril,
enforced he was by most earnest prayers not only of his own but also of his
mother, to require and seek for to return which he obtained at length with
the help somewhat of good fortune. AUGUSTUS had fully set down with himself

sights, as also by predictions and prophesies even from his very birth. For
LIVIA whiles she went with child of him, among many and sundry experiments

should bring forth a man child or no?) took closely an egg from under an hen

seen before time at Rhodes) perched upon the very top and ridge of his house:
and the very day before he had intelligence given him of his return, as he
was changing his apparel, his shirt was seen on fire. THRASYLLVS ( b) also

turned him headlong down into the sea, as being a false prophet, (for that
things fell out untowardly and contrary to his former predictions) and one
besides; who chanced for the most part to be privy unto him of all his

time forward was there nothing pretermitted for the augmentation of his state
and Majesty: and much more after that AGRIPPA once was in disfavour and sent
away: whereby the world took knowledge for certain, that the hope of
succession rested only in him.

16. Now was the Tribunitian Authority conferred a second time upon him, and
that for the term of 5. years; the honorable charge and commission likewise,
for to pacify the State of Germany was assigned unto him: and the Parthian
Ambassadors, after they had declared their message at Rome unto AUGUSTUS, were
commanded to repair unto him also Germany
into his province: But upon the news that ILLYRICVM revolted, he remooved
from Out of Germany. A. V. C. 760.
thence to the charge of a new war, which, being of all foraine wars the
most dangerous since those with the Carthaginians, he menaged with the power of
15: Legions, and equal forces of Auxiliaries, for the space of 3. years in
great extremity of all things, but especially in exceeding scarcetie of Corn.
And notwithstanding that he was oftentimes revoked from this service, yet
persisted he unto the end fearing least the enemy so near a neighbor and so
puissant with all, should make head and come upon them, if they first did quit
the place and retire. And verily, passing well paid and rewarded was he for
this perseverance of his; as having thereby fully subdued and brought under his
subjection all ILLIRYCVM. as far as reaches and spreads between Italy,
the kingdom of Noricum, Thracia, and Macedonie: between the river Danubius
also and the gulf of the Adriaticke sea. A. V. C. 762.


Which glorious exploit of his was yet more amplified and increased by the 17
opportunity of an occurrent that fell between. For, about the very same
time QVINTILIVS VARVS together with 3. Legions was overthrown and defaited in
Germany: and no man made any doubt, but that the Germans following the
train of this their victory, would have joined with PANNONIA in case
ILLYRICVM had not been subdued before. For these his noble Acts, a triumph
with many great honors was decreed for him: Some also delivered their
sentence, that he should be surnamed PANNONICVS; others would have had the
addition of Invincible: and some again of PIUS, in his Style; But as touching
any such surname, AUGUSTUS interposed his negative voice, promising and
undertaking in his behalf, that he should rest contented with i. Augustus.
that, which he was to assume after his death: As for the Triumph, himself did
put it of unto a further day, by occasion that the whole Of Rome
state, sorrowed for the overthrow and loss above said of VARVS:
Nevertheless, he entered the City in his rich Praetexta or imbrodred purple
Robe, with a chaplet of laurel upon his head: and so mounted up to the
Tribunal erected for him in the ( a) Septa, whiles the Senate stood to give
attendance: and there, together with AUGUSTUS, in the mids between the two
Consuls he took his place and sat down. From whence, after he had saluted
the people, he was honorably conducted round about all the Temples.

18 The next year following, being returned into Germany, when he perceived
A. V. C. 763.
that the Varian defeature aforesaid happened through the rashness and
negligence of the General, he did nothing at all without the opinion of his
Counsel of war. And whereas he had used also before, to stand upon his own
bothom, and to rest in his selfe-iudgement alone; then, contrary to his manner
he conferred with many as touching the menagement of the war: yea, and he
showed more care and preciseness in every point than his wont was afore-time.
Being about to pass over the Rhene, all his provision of victuals strictly
reduced to a certain rate and stint, he would not send over the water before
he had considered (standing upon the very bank of the river) the lode of every
Wagon, that no cariages might be Deponerentur, vel deportar ^tur. i.

discharged or unloaden, but such as were by him allowed and thought necessary.
When he was once on the otherside of Rhene this course and order of life he
held: Namely to sit upon a bare bank of turfe, and so to eat his meat: to
lie abroad all night, and take his rest oftentimes without tent: to deliver all
directions for the day following, as also what sudden service or business
was to be enjoined, by writing; with this caveat and admonition, That whereof
any man doubted, he should repair unto him at all hours of the night, and
seek for no other expositour but himself.

Martial discipline he required most sharply, bringing again into ure and 19
execution certain kinds of chastisements and ignominious disgraces which had
been used in ancient times: in so much, as he branded with open shame the
Lieutenant of a Legion, for sending a few Soldiers with his own freedman
over the other side of the river a hunting. As for battles, albeit he did
put as little as might be upon the hazard of Fortune and chance: yet entered he
upon them with much more resolution, so often as whiles he watched or studied
by a candle, the light suddenly fell down and went out, when nobody forced
it: trusting confidently (as he said) upon this sign, which both he and all
his Ancestors had tried and found to be infallible during all their warlike
conducts and regiments. But howsoever he sped well and had good success in
this Province, he escaped very fair that he had not been killed by a
certain A Rhuteni qu^dam.
Rhutene ( a), who being among those that were next about his person, and
detected by his timorous gesture, was apprehended, and with torture forced to
confess his prepensed designment.

20 Being after two years returned out of Germany to Rome, he rode in that

triumph which he had differred, accompanied with his Lieutenants, for whom he
had obtained ( a) triumphall Ornaments. And ere he turned into the Capitol
he alighted from his Chariot, and bowed himself to the knees of his August^
Caesar.
Father, sitting then before him as President. A Captain and Commander of
PANNONIA named BATON, he rewarded first, with exceeding great Presents, and
then remooved him to Ravenna, in thankful requital for suffering him upon a
time, when with his Army he was enclosed within the streights, to pass
forward and escape. After this, he bestowed upon the people (of Rome) a
solemn dinner, where they sat at a thousand tables* and gave besides to them
three thousand Sesterces a piece for a Congiarie. He dedicated also the temple
of Concord: likewise that of Pollux and Castor in his own name and his
brothers, all out of the spoil woone from the enemies.

And not long after, when by virtue of an Act preferred by the Consuls, 21
That he should administer the Provinces jointly with AUGUSTUS: and likewise
A. V. C. 766.
hold the general review and muster of the people, he had performed the same
and finished it with a solemn purging called Lustrum, he took his journey
into Illyricum. And being incontinently called back out of the very way, he
came A. V. C. 767.
and found AUGUSTUS dangerously sick, how beit yet breathing and alive: with
whom he continued in secret talk, one whole day. I wot well, it is commonly
received and believed, that when TIBERIUS after private conference was gone
forth, these words of AUGUSTUS were over heard by the Chamberlaines. Miserum
populum Romanum qui sub tam lentis maxillis erit. Ounhappie people of Rome,
that shall be under such a slow ( a) pair of chawes. Neither am I ignorant of
this also, that some have written and reported of AUGUSTUS, How openly and in
plain terms without dissimuling, he disliked his churlish behavior and
harshnesse of manners so much, as diverse times being in pleasant discourse and
merry talk, he would breake-of when TIBERIUS came in place: Howbeit, overcome
by his wives entreaty and earnest prayer he refused not to adopt him; or rather
was induced so to do, upon an ambitious humor and conceit of his own, that
leaving such a successor, himself might another day be more missed and wished
for again. Yet cannot I be persuaded otherwise, but to think, that AUGUSTUS a
right circumspect, considerate and prudent Prince did nothing, especially in so
weighty a business, hand over head and without advise: but having duly weighed
the vices and virtues of TIBERIUS, esteemed his virtues of more worth: and
namely seeing that both he swear solemnly in a general assembly of the people,
That he adopted him for the ( b) good of the Commonweal* and also commends
him in certain Epistles for a most expert and martial warrior, yea the only
Defender and Protector of the people of Rome. Out of which, I have thought
good to quote some places here and there for example. Farewell most sweet
TIBERIUS, and God bless your conduct and proceeding, warring as you do for
me and the Muses. Again, O most pleasant, and (as I desire to be happy)
right valiant man, (...) or (...), i. thy friends.
and accomplished Captain, with all perfections, adieu. Also, Astouching the
order and manner of your Sommer-campe, for mine own part verily, my TIBERIUS,
I am of this mind, That considering so many difficulties and distresses: in
regard also of so great sloth and cowardice of Soldiers, no man in the world
could perform the service better than you have done. And even they of your
train, who were with you do all confess, that this verse may be applied
fitly unto you.

( c) Vnus homo nobis vigilando restituit rem.

One man alone by watchful sight
Our tottering state has set upright.
And whether, quoth he, there fall out any occurrent to be considered upon with
more care and diligence, or whether I be displeased and angry at any thing, I
have a great miss, I assure you, of my TIBERIUS: and evermore that verse of
HOMER comes into my remembrance:

( d)

(...) * I^iad. ^.

(...)
Whiles this man bears me company (so well he does foresee)
We may even out of flaming fire return, both I and he.
When I hear say and read* that you are weakened and grown lean with
uncessant and continual labor, God confound me, if my body do not quake and
tremble. I pray you therefore spare your self: least if it come to our ears,
that you are sick, both I and your mother also die for sorrow, and the people
of Rome beside, hazard the Empire. It makes no matter, whether Ibe in health or
no? Situ non valebis: or, si tu modo Valeb^. So you cc^tue well.
if you be not well; The Geds I beseech, to preserve you for us and vouchsafe
your health both now and ever, unless they hate the people of Rome to death.

The death of AUGUSTUS he divulged not abroad, before that young AGRIPPA 22
was slain. This AGRIPPA was killed by a military Colonel^
Tribune, set and appointed to guard him, so soon as he had read the writ Or
warrant*
, whereby he was commanded to do the deed. This writ, whether AUGUSTUS left
behind him when he died, thereby to take away all matter that might minister
tumult after his death: or whether LIVIA in the name of AUGUSTUS endited it,
and that with the privity of TIBERIUS, or without his knowledge, it rests
doubtful. Certain it is, that when the said Tribune brought him word, that
the thing was dispatched which he had commanded, he made answer, That he gave
no such commandment, and added moreover, That he should answer it before the
Senate: Declining no doubt the envy and hard conceit of men for the present:
for within a while after he buried the matter in silence.

Having now assembled the Senate by virtue and authority ( a) of his
Tribuneship, 23
and begun to make a Which he had penned.
speech unto them by way of For the death of Augustus.
Consolation: all on a sudden, as unable to master his grief, he fell into
a fit of sighing and groaning. Yea he wished, That not only his voice, but his
vital breath also might fail him* and therewith gave the book unto his son
DRUSUS to read it out. After this, when the last will or testament of AUGUSTUS
was brought in, and none of the witnesses admitted to come in place, but those
only who were of Senators degree, the rest standing without the Curia and
there acknowledging their hands and seals, he caused it to be read and
pronounced by his freed man. The will began in this manner. For as much as
sinister fortune has bereft me of CAIUS and LUCIUS, my sons, I will that
TIBERIUS CAESAR be mine heir, in the one moity and a sixth part. By which very
beginning, their suspicion * That is to say, in 8 parts of twelve, or 2 third
parts
was augmented who thought thus, that seeing he forbear not after this sort to
make his preface, he ordained TIBERIUS to be his successor upon necessity,
rather than any judgment and discretion.

Albeit he made no doubt to enter upon his imperial government immediately 24
and to menage the same, and that by taking unto him a strong guard of
Soldiers about his person, that is to say maine force and the very form of
absolute rule and dominion: yet notwithstanding, he refused it a long time: and
putting on a most impudent and shamlesse mind, one while he seemed to rebuke
his friends that encouraged him thereto, as those who knew not, what a
monstrous and untamed beast an Empire was: and otherwhiles with ambiguous
answers and crafty delays holding the Senate in suspense when they besought
him to take it upon him, yea and humbly debased themselves before his knees* in
so much as some of them having their patience moved therewith, could endure him
no longer: and one among the rest in that tumult cried aloude, Let him either
do it at once, or else give over quite: and another openly to his face
upbraided him in these words, Whereas other men be slack in doing and
performing that which they have promised, he was slack in promising that which
he did and performed. In the end, as if forsooth he had been compelled, and
complaining withal, that there was imposed upon his shoulders a miserable and
burdensome servitude, he took the Empire upon him: and yet no otherwise, than
giving hope, that one day he would resign it up. His very words are these,
Until I come unto that time, wherein ye may think it meet to give some rest
unto mine aged years.

The cause of this holding of and delay that he made, was the fear of imminent
25
dangers on every side, in so much as he would often say, He held a Woolfe by
the ears. For there was one of AGRIPPAES slaves named CLEMENS, who had levied
and gathered together no small power, for to revenge his Masters death: and L.
SCRIBONIUS LIBO, a noble man* secretly complotted sedition and rebellion: yea,
and a twofold mutiny of the Soldiers arose, in Illyricum and in Germany.
Both the armies called hard upon him for performance of many matters
extraordinarily: but above all, that they might have equal pay with the ( a)
Pretorian soldiers. And as for the ( b) Germanician soldiers, they verily
refused him for their Prince and Sovereign, as not by them ordained: and with
all their might and maine urged GIRMANICUS, who then was their General to take
upon him the government of the State, albeit he withstood and denied them
stoutly, Fearing therefore the issue and danger of this occurrent most of all,
he required for himself to have that part of the Commonweal in charge, which
it should please the Senate to lay upon him: seeing that no man was sufficient
to weld the whole, unless he had another or many assistants rather joined with
him. He feigned himself also to be sickly, to the end that GERMANICUS might
with the better will and more patience abide in expectance either of speedy
succession after him, or at least ways of fellowship in the Empire with him.
Well, after he had appeased those mutinies, CLEMENS likewise by a fraudulent
wile he over-raught, and brought to his devotion. As for LIBO, because he would
not be thought at his entrance newly into the Empire for to proceed
rigorously, two years after and not before he charged and reproved him before
the Senate, contenting himself all that mean space to beware of him only,
and to stand upon his guard. For, as the said LIBO was together with him among
other Pontifies sacrificing, he took order, that in steed of the (iron)
cleaver, there should be closely laid for him a chopping knife of Lead: And
when the same LIBO requested upon a time to have secret talk and conference
with him, he would not grant it, without his son DRUSUS might be by: and so
long as he walked up and down with LIBO, he seemed to lean upon his hand; and
so, held it sure enough all the while until their communication was ended.

26 But being once delivered from this fear he carried himself at the
beginning very orderly and after a civil sort, yea and somewhat Paulo min^s
qua^ pri^atum egit: or, little better than the port, etc.
under the port of a private person. Of very many dignities and those right
honorable, which by public decree were presented unto him, he accepted but
few, and those of the meanest kind. His birth-day-mind, falling out in the time
of the Plebcian ( a) games and plays exhibited in the Cirque, he hardly would
suffer to be celebrated and honored so much as with the addition
extraordinarily of one chariot drawn with two Steedes. He forbad expressly,
any temples Flamins or Priests to be ordained for him, yea and the erection of
Statues and images in his honor, without his leave and permission* the which
ran with this only clause and condition, That they should not be set up
among the images of the Gods, but stand with other ornaments of the house. He
prohibited also by his negative voice the solemn oath of observing and keeping
his Acts inviolably: as also to call the month Or November rather ^or in at

September, TIBERIUS; or or September of his mothers.
October, LIVIUS. The forename also in his style of ( b) IMPERATOR; the surname
likewise of PATER PATRIAE; as also a ( c) Civick Coronet at the fore gate or
porch of his Palace he refused. Nay, the very name of AUGUSTUS, haereditarie
though it were, he would not put as an addition to any of his Epistles, but
those only which he sent unto Kings and great Potentates. Neither bare he
more than three Consulships: the first but a few days* the second three
months; the third in his absence no longer than unto the F^o^ the Calerds or

He derested flattery and obsequious complements so much, as that he would
admit no Senator to his Licter side either by way of dutiful attendance, 27
or otherwise about any business whatsoever. When a certain One who had been

entreat and crave pardon by a reverent touching of his knees, he started and

lay along upon his back. Yea, and that which more is, if in any talk or
continued speech there passed words of him smelling of flattery, he would not
stick to interrupt the speaker, to check him, and presently to alter and
correct such terms. One there was who called him DOMINUS, that is, Or Lord.
S^. but he gave him warning not to name him any more by way of con^mely.
Another chanced to say, His sacred businesses: and a third again, That he
went into the Senate, auctore se. i. by his warrant or authority. He caused
them both to change those words, and for auctore to say Suasore, that is, by
his advise and counsel: and in steed of Sacred, to put in, Laborious and
painful.

Moreover, against railing taunts, bad reports and rumors, as also slanderous
libels, verses and songs cast out either of himself or those about him, 28
he stood so firm and patient, as that ever and anon he would give out, That
in a free state, folk ought to have both tongue and thought free. And when
upon a time the Senate called earnestly unto him, That such crimes, and the
offenders themselves might be brought iudicially into question; We have not
quoth he, so much leisure as to entangle our selves in many affairs. If ye
open this window once, ye will suffer nothing else to be done: for under

that he speak otherwise of me than well, I will endeavor to give an account
of my a^edes and words, but in case he continue so still, I will hate him for
it again.

And these things were so much the more remarqueable in him, for that in 29
speaking to them ^ The Senators.
either one by one severally, or to all at once in general, yea and in
reverencing them, himself exceeded in a manner the measure of all humanity.
When he dissented one day in opinion from Q. HATERIUS in the Senate: Pardonmee,
I beseech you, quoth he, if I as a Senator shall speak ought over-frankly
against you and then directing his speech unto the whole house. Both now,
quoth he, and many times else, my Lords, this has been my saying, That a
good and gracious Prince, whom ye have invested in so great and so absolute a
power, ought to serve the Senate and all the Citizens generally: often times
also, yea and for the most part, every of them particularly. Neither repent I
that I have so said, for I have ever found you, and do so still to be my good,
my gracious and favorable Lords.

Furthermore, he brought in a certain show of the common Liberty, by 30
preserving entier for the Senate and Magistrates, both their ancient majesty
and also their authority: neither was there any matter so small or so great,
pertaining to public or private affairs, but proposed it was at the

31 That some Decrees were enacted against his mind and sentence, he never

Theater: he could not prevail but that the will of the Testator should stand
and be fulfilled. When it fortuned upon a time that an Act of the Senate should
pass by going to a side, and himself went over to the other part where the
fewer in number were, there was not one that followed him. Other matters also
were handled and debated by the Magistrates and the ordinary course of law,
and not otherwise: Wherein the Consuls* bare so great sway and authority, that

also very often, when the Magistrates were sitting judicially upon the Bench,

that there should be a gage set, and a mediocritie kept in household furniture:
as also that the price of victuals in open market should be ordered yearly at
the discretion of the Senate, with a charge given unto the Aediles for to

variance to be a murder committed in the Theater: But the principal heads of
the faction, as also the actours themselnes for whose sake the quarrel and fray

Decurions. The privilege and custom of Sanctuaries, where ever they were, he
abolished. The Cyzicenes who had committed some notorious outrage and violence
upon Roman Citizens, he deprived generally of their freedom, which in the
war against MITHRIDATES they had by their good service gotten. The rebellions
of enemies he repressed: not undertaking therefore, any expedition afterward
himself, but by his lieutenant only: and not by them verily without lingering
delays, and driven thereto of necessity. Kings that rebelliously took arms,
or were suspected to break out, he kept down with threats rather and
complaints, than otherwise by force and open hostility. Some of them, whom
he had trained out of their own Realms unto him with fair words and large
promises he never sent home again: as by name MARABODUUS the German,
THRASYPOLIS a Thracian: and ARCHELAVS the Cappadocian, whose kingdom also he
reduced into the form of a province.

For two years together after he came unto the Empire, he never set foot 38
once out of Rome gates. And the time ensuing, he absented not himself in no
place unless it were in towns near adjoining, or as far as Antium when he
travailed farthest: and that was very seldom and for a few days: albeit he
promised and pronounced openly oftentimes that he would visit the provinces
also and armies abroad: yea and every year almost he made preparation for a
journey, taking up all the waines and wagons that were to be gotten, and laying
provision of Corn and victuals in all the good Burroughes and Colonies by the
way, yea and at the last suffered vows to be made for his going forth and
return home: in so much as commonly by way of a jest and byworde, he was
called ( a) CALLIPPID^S, who in a Greek proverb is noted to be always
running, and yet never gains ground one cubit forward.

But being bereft of both his sons, of which Adopted.

DEVSVS at Rome, he withdrew himself into Campania, as to a retyring place:
and all men well near, were fully persuaded and spoke it as constantly, that
he would never return but die soon after. Both which had like indeed to have
come to pass. For, in truth he never came again to Rome: and within some few
days, near unto Tarracina, in a certain part of his manor house (built
especially for his own lodging) and called Spelunca, as he fat there at
supper, a number of huge stones from above chanced to fall down: whereby many
of his guestes at the Table and servitours there waitinge were crushed and
squized to death; but he himself beyond all hope escaped,

Having made his progress over Campania, when he had dedicated a Capitol at
Capua, and the Temple of AUGUSTUS at Nola, which he pretended to 40
have been the motive of his journey, he betook himself to Capreae delighted
especially with that Island because there was but one way of access unto it and
the same by a small shore and landing place: as being otherwise enclosed round
about, partly with craggy rocks and steep cliffes of an exceeding height; and
in part with the deep sea. But soon after, when the people called him home,
and uncessantly besought him to return, by occasion of an unhappie and heavy
accident, whereby at Fi^eny XX. Strangers that conflowed thither to see the

thousand folk and more, at a solemn fight of sword players perished by fall
of an Amphitheater, he passed over into the maine and firm land, permitting
all men to come unto him: the rather, for that when he first set forth and went
out of Rome, he had given straight commandment by an Edict that no man should
trouble him, and all the way voided as many as were coming toward him.

Being retired again into the said Isle, he cast aside all care verily of
Common weal; so far forth as never after he did so much as repair and make
up 41
the broken decuries of horse men: He changed no military Tribunes nor
Captains: no nor any presidents and Governors of Provinces. He held Spain
and Syria both, for certain years, without Consulare Lieutenantes: he
neglected Armenia and suffered it to be overrunne and possessed by the
Parthians: Masia to be wasted and spoiled by the Dakes and Sarmatians, as also
Gaul by the Germans, to the great shame and no less danger of the whole
Empire.

To proceed, having now gotten the liberty of this secret place, and being 42
as one would say remooved from the eyes of people: at lenght he poured forth
and showed at once all those vices which with much a do for a long time he had
cloked and dissimuled. Of which I will particularize and make relation from the
very beginning. In the Camp when he was but a new and untrained soldier,
for his excessive greediness of wine bibbing, he was for ( a) TIBERIUS named
BIBERIVS, for CLAUDIUS, CALDIVS* for NERO, MERO: After being Emperor, even at
the very time when he was busy in reforming the public manners and

the government of the province Siria: upon the other he conferred the

out of his ordinary and customed manner: and namely, that wenches all naked
should serve at the Table. He preferred one to be a competitour for the

drank unto him. Unto AS^LLIVS SABINVS he gave 200000. Sesterces for a
diologue of his making, in which he brought in a com bate or disputation,
between the Mushrome, the (c) Ficedula the Oister and the (d) Thrush. To
conclude, he instituted a new office, forsooth, For the devifing of new
pleasures. etc.
a voluptatibus, wherein he placed PRISCUS a gentleman of Rome, and one who had
been Censor.

But during the time of his private abode in Capreae, he devised a room 43
with seats and benches in it, even a place of purpose for his secret wanton
lusts. To furnish it there were sought out and gathered from all parts, a
number of youngs drabbes and stale Catamites, sorted together* such also as
invented monstrous kinds of libidinous filthiness, whom he termed Spintriae:
who being in three ranks or rewes linked together should abuse and pollute one
another body before his face: that by the very sight of them he might stir
up his own cold courage and fainting lust. He had bed chambers besides, in
many places, which he adorned with tables and petie puppets: representing in
the one sort, most lascivious pictures, and in the other as wanton shapes and
figures. He stored them likewise with the books of Elephantis: that none might
be to seek for a pattern of the semblable form and fashion, in that beastly
business performed in every kind. He devised in the woods also and groves
here and there, certain places for lechery and venereous Acts: wherein he had
within caves and holow rocks youths of both sexes standing at receipt ready

He incurred yet the infamy of greater and more shameful filthiness, such as
may not well be named or heard, and much less believed: to wit, that he
should train up and teach fine boys the tenderest and daintiest that might be

thighs as he was swimming, and pretily with tongue and teeth seem to make

grouth and strength* howbeit as yet not weaned, he should set unto his privy
member as unto the nipple of a breast, to suck. And verily, both by nature and

kind. Therefore, whereas a certain painted table of PARRASIVS making, (in
which ATALANTA yeldeth her mouth unto MELEAGER in that beastliness) was given
unto him as a legacy: upon condition, that if he were offended with the
argument or matter represented therein, he might in lieu thereof receive a
millian of Sesterces, he not only preferred the said picture before such a
sum of money, but also dedicated it in his own bedchamber. It is reported
besides, that being at sacrifice upon a time, he casting a fancy to the
beautiful and well favored face of a youth and servitour as he carried before
him the Or incense pa^.

sacrifice were well and fully performed, even there and then, take him a side
out of the place and so abuse his body: and together with him a brother of
his, the minstrel* yea and soon after, for that they twitted and upbraided one
another for this abominable act, he brake their legs both.

Moreover, in what sort he was wont to offer abuse unto the very heads of 45
women, and those nobly borne and of good reputation, appeared most evidently
by the woeful end of one dame named MALLONIA. For when she was by force
brought unto his bed, and most resolutely; to die for it, refused to suffer any
more, than naturally a woman was to suffer: he suborned certain promoters
falshly to accuse her: and evermore as she pleaded in her own defense asked
her still, whether she repented not yet of her Obstinacy? which he followed
so long, until at length she left the Court, made have home to her house, and
there ran her self through with a Or dagger.

he had undertaken, after so many years he left unfinished) nor exhibited so
much as one solemn show unto the people: and at those which were by any other
set out, he was very seldom present; and all for fear least some thing should
be demanded at his hands: and namely after that he was compelled once to
manumise the Comaedian An Actour in a Comaedie,
Actius. Having releeved the want and poverty of some Senators, because he
would not help more of them, he denied to succor any other than those, who
alleged before the Senate good and just causes of their necessities. By which
deed of his; he frighted the most part upon a modesty and bashfulnesse in
them: and among the rest, one ORTALVS, the nephew of Q. HORTENSIVS the

48 As touching his public munificence, he never showed it but twice: once,
when he purposed and published a free lone for 3. years of an hundred millians
of Sesterces: and again, when unto certain Land lords of fair houses and
tenements, which situate upon mount Caelius, were consumed with fire, he
restored the full price and worth of them. One of these Boones he was forced to
grant, by reason that the people in great want of money called earnestly for
his help: what time as by virtue of an Act of Senate he had ordained, That
Usurers should lay out two (third) parts of their Or patrimoni^

his bountiful hand, except it were Asia, by occasion that certain Cities With

therein were by earthquake overthrown.

49 Afterward, and in process of time he gave his mind wholly even to rapine
and plain pillage. It is for certain known, That CN. LENTULUS the * In

childlesse withal: who having before time put her away being his wedded
wife, twenty years after called her iudicially into question, and laid to her
charge, that long ago she had bought and provided poison for to take away his
life. Besides, as well known it is, that certain Princes and Potentates of
Gaul, Spain, Syria and Greece, forfaited their estates upon so slight a
slander and impudent imputation, that against some of them naught else was
objected but this, That they had part of their substance and wealth more than

ancient immunities and privileges, as also their right in mines and metals,
Tolls and customs: and finally that VONONES a King of the Parthians who being
driven out of his kingdom by his own subjects, retired himself with an huge
mass of Treasure into Antiochia, under the protection, as it were, of the
people of Rome, was perfidiously stripped out of all and killed.

The hatred that he bare to his kinsfolk and near Allies, he bewraied, 50
first in his brother DRUSUS by disclosing a letter of his: wherein he dealt
with him about compelling AUGUSTUS to restore the common Liberty: afterward,
in others also. As for his wife IULIA, so far was he from showing any
courtesy or kindness unto her when she stood confined (which had been the
least matter of a thousand) that whereas by an Ordinance of her fathers, she
was shut up within one Town, he gave straight order that she should not
step out of doors, and enjoy the Society of people and worldly commerce:
nay, he proceeded so far, as to bereave her of that little stock and
housholde-stuffe which her Father allowed her: yea, and defrauded her of the
yearly Pension and exhibition for her maintenance: and all, forsooth, under a
color of common right and law; because AUGUSTUS in his last will and testament
had not expressly provided in this behalf. Being notable well to endure his
mother LIVIA, as chalenging to her self equal part with him in power and
authority, he avoided both to keep ordinary and daily company, and also to
entertain long speech or secret conference with her; because he might not be
thought ruled and directed by her counsels; which otherwhiles notwithstanding
he was wont both to stand in need of, and also to use. Semblably, he took to
the very heart the passing of this Act in the Senate, That in his style as he
had the title, son of AUGUSTUS, so this addition should run withal son
of LIVIA. And therefore it was, that he would not suffer her to be named Mother
of her Country.
PARENS PATRIAE, nor to receive any remarkable honor in open place and by
public decree. Oftentimes also he admonished her to forbear intermedling in
greater affairs, and such as were not meet for women; especially after he
perceived once, that when the Temple of Vesta was on fire, she also came
thither in person among others, and there encouraged the people and soldiers
both, to do their best and help all what they could, as her manner was to do
in her husbands days.

By these degrees he proceeded even to secret rancour and malice against her, 51
but chiefly upon this occasion, as men report. She had been very earnest with
him many a time to enrole one in the ( a) Decuries of the Judges who was made
free Denizen and Citizen of Rome* but he denied flatly to choose and admit the
party, unless it were upon this only condition, That she would suffer a
clause to be written and annexed to the Instrument Quorum nomin^, or such like.
or Roll, in these words, This grant was by my mother wrung and wrested from
me. Whereat she highly displeased and offended, brought forth out of her Closet
and Cabinet certain old letters of AUGUSTUS (written) unto her, as touching
his perverse, bitter and intolerable manners; and those she openly read. He
again took the matter so greevously, that she had both kept those writings so
long by her, and also cast them in his dish so spitefully, that some think
this was the greatest cause of his departure from the City. And verily, for
the space of three years complete, during which time he was absent and his
mother living, he saw her but once: and that was no more than one day, and
very few hours of the same. And afterward as little mind he had to be by
her lying sick: and when she was dead, suffering her corpse by staying so long
above ground (whiles men hoped still of his coming) to corrupt at length and
putrify: after she was enterred, he forbad that she should be canonized and
registered in the Catalogue of Saints: pretending as if she her self had given
that order. Her will he annulled, all her friends and familiars, even those
unto whom upon her deathbed she had committed the charge of her Funerals,
within a short time he persecuted and plagued, yea and one of them, to wit, a

came somewhat with the latest to comfort him; he, (as if now by this time the
memory of his sorrow had been clean worn out,) scoffed at them and made
this answer, That he likewise was sorry in their behalf for the less they
had of HECTOR, so noble and brave a Citizen. As for GERMANICUS, he depraved and
disgraced him so, as that not only he did extenuate and diminish all his
worthy exploits as mere vain and needless, but also blamed his most glorious
victories, as dangerous and hurtful to the Commonwealth. Also, for that
without his advise, he went unto Alexandria, (by occasion of an extreme and

to do: but that SEIANUS secretly withstood it. For which, TIBERIUS was

quoth he, Think thou pretty daughter that thou art wronged? and so
vouchsafed her no speech at all after. Also, because upon a time, when she
durst not at supper taste of those appels which he had reached unto her, he
forbear to invite her any more; pretending, that she charged him with the crime
of attempting her with poison: when as in deed, it was of purpose plotted and
packed aforehand, both that himself should by the offering of such fruit tempt
her, and she again beware most present and assured death. At the last, having
untruly accused her, as if she minded to fly one while to the Statue of
AUGUSTUS, and another while to the Armies, he confined and sent her away to
the Isle Pandataria; and as she railed at him, he by the hands of a Centurion
with whipping and lashing her over the face struck out one of her eyes.
Again, when as she was fully determined to pine herself to death: he caused
her mouth perforce to be opened, and meat to be crammed into her throat:
Yea, and after that by continuance in this mind she consumed quite away and
died in the end, he inveighed against her in most odious and reproachful
terms: having opined first in the Senate, that her birthday also should be
reckoned among the dismal and unlucky days. Furthermore, he expected thanks,
as for an high favor done unto her, in that he strangled her not before with
acord, and so flung her to the Scale.

Whereas by GERMANICUS he had three nephews, NERO, DRUSUS and 5^
CAIUS; by DRUSUS one, to wit TIBERIUS, when he was left destitute and
fatherless by the death of his children, the two eldest sons of GERMANICUS,
namely NERO and DRUSUS, he recommended to the LL. of the Senate; and celebrated
the day of both their Commencements with giving a Or Largess.

ought not to be conferred upon any persons, but those that were experienced and
far stepped in years, Thereby, having discovered the inward character and
canker of his heart, from that day forward he exposed them to the slanders and
imputations of all men: When also, by sundry subtle devises he had wrought
so, that they might be both provoked to give railing taunts, and also being
so provoked come to mischief and destruction; he accused them in his letters,
heaped most bitterly upon them heinous reproaches, caused them to be judged
enemies to the State, and so hunger-starved them to death; NERO, within the

they could be ever gathered together.

55 Over and above his old friends and familiars, he had demanded twenty out
of the number of the best and principal Citizens, as Counsailours and
Assistants unto him in public affairs. Of all these, he could hardly show
twain or three at the most alive: the rest, some for one cause and some for
another he brought to confusion and killed* among whom (with the calamity and
overthrow of many more) was AELIUS SEIANUS, whom he had to the highest place
of authority advaunced, not so much for any good will, as to be his instrument
and right hand, by whose ministry and fraudulent practices he might
circumvent the children of GERMANICUS, and so establishe as heir apparent in
succession of the Empire the Nephew he had by DRUSUS, as his natural son.

No milder was he one jot unto the Greek Professors and Artists, living 56
and conversing daily with him, and in whom he took most contentment. One of
them named ZENO, as he reasoned and discoursed very * exactly of a question he
asked, What harsh Dialect Or curiously.
that was, wherein he spoke? and when he answered, It was the Dorick* he
confined him for his labor into Cynaria, supposing that he twitted and
reproached him for his old vacation and absence from Rome because the Rhodians
spoke Dorick. Semblably, whereas his manner was out of his own daily readings,
to propound certain questions as he sat at supper: having intelligence, That
SELEUCUS the Grammarian enquired diligently of his Ministers and Servitours,
what Authors at any time he had in hand, and so came prepared to assoile the
said questions, first he forbad him his house and ordinary Society,
afterward he forced him even to death.

His cruel, close and unpliable nature was not hidden no not in his very 57
childhood* the which THEODORUS GADARAEUS his teacher in Rhetoric, seemed both
at first to foresee most wisely, and also to express and resemble as fitly,
when by way of chiding and rebuke he called him ever and anon Pelon Haimati

had left for the Commons of Rome. Him, he caused to be haled and brought unto
his presence, to receive also the debt which was due: and then commanded him
to be led to execution, and so to relate the truth unto his father (AUGUSTUS).
Not long after as he threatened to send unto prison one POMPEIUS a Roman
Knight, for stoutly denying some thing, he assured him, That of a POMPEIUS he
would make him a POMPEIANUS, glauncing by this bitter and biting taunt, both at
the man's name and also at the old infortunity of ^ The Pompe^ani, that took
part with Pompeius against Julius Caesar

There was one who from the Statue of AUGUSTUS had taken away the head, for to
set the same upon the Statue of another. The matter was debated in the Senate:
and because some doubt arose, Who did the deed? inquisition was made by
torture. The party delinquent being condemned; this kind of Calumniation by

or deed of his, in the least credit and reputation that might be. To
conclude, it cost one his life, for suffering in his own Colonie, honors to
be decreed unto him, upon the same day, that they had in times past been
decreed for AUGUSTUS.

Many parts besides under the color of gravity and reformation, but rather 59
in deed following the course of his own nature; he used to play, so cruelly
and with such rigor, that some there were, who in verses both upbraided by way
of reproach the calamities present, and also gave warning of the future
miseries, in this manner.

Which verses at first, he would have had to be taken and construed as made by
them who were impatient of any Lordly rule and absolute dominion at Rome: and
as if they had been framed and devised, not so much with any considerate
judgment, as upon Stomach and Choler. And evermore his saying was, Oderint aum
probent i Let them hate me, so long as they suffer my proceedings to pass. But
afterward, even himself proved them to be very true and most certain.

Within few days after he came to Capreae, when a Fisherman, suddenly 60
and unlooked for presented unto him (as he was in a secret place doing
somewhat by himself) a Being ^kaly and having a couple of barbe^.
Barble of an extraordinary bigness, he caused his face to be rubbed all over
with the same fish: as put in a fright, no doubt, for that from the back side
of that Island, he had made means thorough the rough thickets and by-ways, to
creep and get unto him where he was. And when the poor fellow amid this
punishment seemed to rejoice yet, and said, It was happy that he had not offered
unto him a lopstar also (which he had caught) of an huge greatness, he
commanded that his face should be grated and mangled likewise with the said

until he was well-neere dead.

61 Soon after, he brake out into all kinds of cruelty; as one who never
wanted matter to work upon: persecuting the familiar friends and
acquaintance of his own Mother first, then, of his Nephews and daughter in
law, and at the last of SEIANUS: after whose death he grew to be most
cruel. Whereby especially it appeared, that himself was not wont so much to
be provoked and set on by SEIANVS: as Qua^ (...) quarent^ occassones

SEIANVS to serve his turn and feed his humor, seeking as he did all
occasions: howsoever in a certain commentary which he composed summarily and
briefly of his own life he durst write thus much, That he executed SEIANVS,
because he had found that he raged furiously against the children of
GERMANICVS his son. Of whom to say a truth, the one himself murdered, after
he had first suspected SEIANVS, and the other, not before he had killed him. To
prosecute in particular all his bloody deeds would require a long time. It
shall suffice therefore to rehearse in general the patterns as it were and
examples of his cruelty. There passed not a day over his head, no not so much
as any festival and ( a) religious holieday, without execution and punishment
of folk. Some suffered even upon Newyeares day. Accused and condemned there
were many together, with their children, and very wives. Straight commandment
and warning was given, that the nere kinsfolk of such persons as stood
condemned to die, should not mourn and lament for them. Especially rewards
were by decree appointed for their accusers; otherwhiles also for bare
witnesses. No informer and promoter was discredited, but his presentme^t taken.

Historians charge, for saying, ( c) that * BRUTUS and CASSIVS, were the last
of all the Romans. Presently were the Authors and writers punished, and their
writings called in and abolished: notwithstanding certain years before they
had been recited even in the hearing of AUGUSTUS, with his good liking and
approbation. Some committed to ward, were deprived not only of their Solace
and comfort in studying, but also of the very use of talking with others. Of
such as were cited peremptorily by writ and process to answer at the bar,
some gave themselves (mortal) wounds at home in their houses (as sure to be
condemned, only to avoid torments and ignominy) others in the open face and
midst of the Court drank poison: and yet were they with their wounds bound
up, and whiles they yet panted between alive and dead, haled away to prison.

live. For he thought simple death so light a punishment, that when he hard, how
one of the prisoners, Or (...)
CARNVLIVS by name, had taken his death voluntarily before, he cried out in
these words. CARNVLIVS has escaped my hands. Also in overseeing and perusing
the prisoners in Jail, when one of them besought to have his punishment with
speed, he made him this answer: Nay marry, thou art not yet reconciled unto
me, that I should show thee such favor. A certain Who had ^eere sometime

He increased and strained still more and more this cruelty, by occasion that

he was galled and fretted at the news of his son DRVSVS his death: For,
having been of opinion, that he died upon some sickness and intemperate life,
so soon as he understood at length, that he was poisoned and so made away by
the villainous practice of his wife Daughter of Germanicus and Agry^pina, and
wife to the said Drusus.

whomsoever; so bent and addicted whole days together to the inquisition and

former injury. The place is yet to be seen at Capreae of his butcherly
carriage: From which he caused condemned persons after long and exquisite
torments to be flung headlong before his face into the sea: where were ready
to receive them a number of mariners, who with their sprits, poles, and oars
should beat and batt their carcasses: to the end that none of them might have
any breath or wind remaining in the bo die: He had devised moreover, among
other kinds of torment, what time as men by deceitful means had their lode
with large drinking of strong wine, suddenly to knit fast and tie their privy
members with (Lute) strings, that he might cause them to swell and be pent in
most dolorous pains occasioned at once as well by the straight strings, as the
suppression and stoppage of urine. And had it not been that both death
prevented and The Astrologer,
THRASYLLVS also enforced him of purpose, (as men say) to put of some designs
in hope of longer life, he would have murdered a good many more (as it is fully
believed) and not spared those very nephews of his that remained yet alive;
considering he both had CAIUS in suspicion, and also cast of TIBERIUS, as
conceived in adultery. And it sounds to truth, that he was minded thus to
do. For, ever and anon, he called PRIAMVS happy in that he overlived all his
sons and daughters.

But, how amid these prankes he lived not only odious and detested, but
exceeding 63
timorous also and exposed to the contumelious reproaches of the world, there be
many evidences to show. That any soothsayers should be sought unto and
consulted with a part without witnesses by, he forbad: As for the Oracles near

65 When SEIANVS went about seditiously to work alteration in the state:
albeit he saw now that both his birth day was publicly solemnized, and also
his Images of gold worshipped every where, he overthrew him (I must needs say)
at length: but with much adoo, by crafty sleights and guile, rather than by
his princely authority and Imperial power. For first, to the end that he
might dismiss the man in show of honor, he assumed him to be his Colleague in

in prison at Rome: should be set at liberty (if need did so require,) and
ordained general captain. Yea and whiles his ships were ready rigged and
prepared to what Legions soever he meant for to fly, he stood looking ever and

had appointed (least messengers might stay too long) for to be reared a great

village called Iovis.

Beside all this, diverse and sundry reproachful taunts from all parts netled
66
and stung his troubled mind. For there was not a person condemned, that
reviled him not in all sorts openly to his face, yea and discharged upon him
opptobrious terms by libels laid for the nonce in the very Where the
Senators sat to behold the plaiet.
Orchestra, with which contumelies verily, affected he was after a most diverse
and contrary manner: so that, one while he desired for very shame of the
world, that all such abuses might be unknown and concealed: otherwhiles, he
contemned the same, and of his own accord broached and divulged them abroad.
Furthermore, rated he was and railed at in the letters also of ARTABANVS K. of
the Parthians, who charged him with parricidies, murders, cowardice and
luxurious roiot: who gave him counsel likewise with all speed possible, to
satisfy with a voluntary death the hatred of his Citizens, conceived against
him in the highest degree and most justly. At the last, being even weary of
himself in the beginning of such an Epistle as this, he declared and
confessed in manner the very sum of all his miseries. What shall I write? my
LL. of the Senate, or how shall I write? Nay, what is it, at a word, that I
shall not write at this time? The Gods and Goddesses all plague and confound me
utterly at once, feeling as I do my self daily to perish.

Some think, that he foreknew all this by the skill he had of For he was
wooderfully addicted to the study of Astrology and such curious Arts:
future events: 67
that he foresaw also long before how great a calamity and infamy both, would
one day betide him: And therefore it was* that he refused most obstinately to
take upon him the Empire and the name of PATER PATRIAE, as also stood against
the oath, to maintain his Acts: for fear least within a while after, to his
greater disgrace and shame he might be found inferior, and unworthie of such
special honors, which verily may be gathered out of the speech he made as
touching both those points, when he says but thus. That he would be always
like to himself, and never change his manners, so long as he continued in his
sound wits. Howbeit, for example sake, provided it would be that the Senate
bind not themselves to keep and ratify the Actions of any one, who by some
chance might be altered. And again, Marie, if at any time, quoth he, ye
shall make doubt of my loyal behavior and devoted mind unto you (which before
it ever happen, I wish my dying day to take me from this mind and opinion of
yours, once conceived of me and afterward changed) the bare title of PATER
PATRIAE will add no honor unto me, but upbraide you either with inconsiderate
rashness, for imposing that Surname upon me, or else with inconstancy, for
your contrary judgments of me.

broad between the shoulders and large breasted: in all other parts also of
the body (from the crown of his head) to the very sole of his foot, of

stronger than the right: and his joints so firm, that with his finger he was
able to bore through a green and sound Apple: with a fillop also to break the
head of a boy, yea of a good stripling and big youth. Of color and complexion
he was clear and white: wearing the hair of his head long behind, in so much

properties being odious and full of arrogancy, AUGUSTUS both observed in him,
and also went about to excuse and cloak for him before the Senate and people,
assuring them, they were the defects and imperfections of nature, and not the
vices of the mind. He lived most healthful. And verily all the time well near

spoke it with facility, yet he used it not every where, but most of all
forbear it in the Senate house: in so much verily, as when he came to name ( a)
MONOPOLIVM, he craved leave before hand. for that he was to use a strange and

return therefore speedily into Campania he fell sick at Astura: but being
eased a little of that malady he went forward as far as to Circeij: and
because he would give no suspicion of sickness, he was not only present
himself at the games exhibited by the garrison soldiers there, but also, when
there was a wild bore put forth into the open shew-place for to be baited, he

he was come down so far as to Misenum, he pretermitted nothing of his
ordinary and daily manner, no not so much as his feasting and other pleasures:
partly upon an intemperate humor of his own, and in part to dissimule and
palliate his weakness. For, when CHARICLES his Physician, who by virtue of a

first tidings thereof, some cried out in this note, (Fling) Tiberium in

in times past, were provoked to anger with a fresh outrage newly committed. For
whereas by an Act of Senate it was provided, That the execution of condemned
persons should be put off unto the tenth day after ( sentence given), it
happened so, that the day on which some of them were to suffer, fell out to be
the very same, wherein news came of TIBERIUS death. These poor souls,

of CAIUS no man was known, who might (in such a case) be repaired unto and

will and testament, he left coheires and equal in portion CAIUS his nephew by
GERMANICUS, and TIBERIUS by DRUSUS. These he substituted and appointed to
succeed one another. He gave legacies also to many more, and among the rest
unto the uestall Virgins, and to the Soldiers of all sorts in general: as
also to the commons of Rome by the poll: yea and to the Masters of every

of AUGUSTUS death, the Legions all throughout stood out most stiffly and
refused TIBERIUS for their Emperor, offering unto him the absolute government

and to quiet the State in the East parts: when he had (...): A. V. C. 772*
deposed the King of Armenia, and brought Cappadocia into the form of a
Province, in the 34 year of his age, he died of a long disease at Antiochia,
not without suspicion of poison. For, besides the blackish and swert spots
which were to be seen all over his body, and the frothie slime that ran
forth at his mouth; his heart also (after he was burnt,) they found among the
bones all sound and not consumed: the nature whereof is thought to be such,
that if it be infected with poison, it checkes all fire and cannot possibly
be burnt.

But, as the opinion of the world went, his death contrived by the wicked 2
plot of TIBERIUS, was effected by the ministry and help of CN. PISO: who

to offend either father or Tiberius himself, or Germanicus his adopted son.
son (as if there were no other remedy but needs he must so do) made no
spare, but beyond all measure dealt with GERMANICUS (sick as he was) most
rigorously, both in word and deed. For which, so soon as he was returned to
Rome, he had like to have been pulled in pieces by the people: and by the
Senate condemned he was to die.

It is for certain known and confessed, that there were in GERMANICUS 3
all good parts and gifts as well of body as mind: and those in such measure,
as never to any man befell the like: to wit, for show full of passing beauty,
favor and feature; with strength and valor answerable thereto and for wit
excellently well seen in eloquence and learning of Greek and Latin,

Lictors. Where ever he knew any Sepulchers of brave and worthy men to be,
there his use was to offer unto their ghosts. Being purposed to enterre in one
tomb the old relics and bones dispersed of those that were slain in that
great overthrow with VARUS, he first gave the assay with his own hand to
gather and carry them together into one place. Moreover, to his slaunderers and
backbiters (if he lighted upon them); of what quality so ever the persons were,
or how great cause so ever they gave, so mild, so remiss and harmless he
was: that notwithstanding PISO reversed and canciled his Decrees, plagued and
persecuted a long time his Dependants, yet could he not find in his heart to
be angry with him, before he had for certain known, that he attempted his
person with poisons and sorcerous execrations: and even then verily, he
proceeded no farther against him, but, more maiorum to renounce all
friendship with him, and to give his domestical friends in charge to be
revenged, if ought happened to himself otherwise than well.

Of these virtues he reaped most plentiful fruit; so liked and loved of his 4
kinsfolk and friends, (for I let pass all other affinities and acquaintance
of his) as that AUGUSTUS after he had continued a long time in suspense,
whether he should ordain him for his Successor or no? recommended him at
length unto TIBERIUS for to be adopted: so highly favored of the Common
people, as that many do report and write; whenever he came unto a place or
departed from thence, diverse times by reason of the multitude flocking to meet
him and to bear him company, he endangered his own life in the preasse. As
he returned out of Germany, after the suppressing of seditious tumults and
mutinies there, all the Praetorian cohorts every one went out to encounter him
upon the way: albeit warning was given before hand by proclamation, That no
more than twain of them should go forth. But as for the people of Rome, of
all sexes, ages, and degrees, they ran out by heaps to meet him xx miles from
Rome.

How beit, far greater, and more assured testimonies of men's judgment 5
touching him appeared at, and after his death. The very day wherein he left

stand in their way and hinder them, so desirous and earnestly bent with joy to
pay their vows. In so much as TIBERIUS was awakened out of his sleep with the
shoutes and voices of the people rejoicing, and from every side with one accord
resounding this Note,

Salva Roma, salva Patria, salvus est Germanicus.
Safe is Rome, safe is our Country, safe is GERMANICUS.
Also, when now at the last it was known abroad that he was departed this
life, the public sorrow by no comfortable words nor edicts and proclamations
could be repressed, but continued still even all the festival days of ( a)
the month December. His glory and the miss of him thus deceased, was much
augmented also, by the outrages of the times ensuing: whiles all men were of
opinion (and not without good reason) That the fierceness of TIBERIUS which
soon after brake forth, was held in and kept down by the reverent respect and
fear that he had of him.

He wedded AGRIPPINA, daughter to M. AGRIPPA and IULIA: by whom 7
he had nine children: of which fair issue twain being yet Infants were taken
away by untimely Death: one died when he was now waxen a jolly boy, passing
full of lovely mirth and pretty talk; whose counterfeit in the habit of CUPID,

wont to kiss while it stood in his bedchamber, so often as he entered into it.
The rest survived their father: three of the female sex AGRIPPINA, DRUSILLA and
LIVIA, borne all one after another in the space of three years: likewise as
many male children, NERO, DRUSUS and CAIUS CAESAR: As for NERO and DRUSUS, the
Senate upon imputations laid by TIBERIUS, judged them to be enemies untothe
State.

when his Father and C. PONTEIUS CAPITO were Consuls. The place of his
Nativitie, by the disagreement of writers, is left uncertain. CN. LENTULUS

Country of the Treviri, in a town called Or Ambiti^.

Confluents. For evidence and proof whereof he farther says, That certain
Altars are there to be seen carrying this Inscription, Ob Agrippina puerperi^m.
For the childbirth and deliverie of AGRIPPINA. But these verses following,
divulged soon after that he came to be Emperor, do plainly show, that borne
he was in the very Camp, where the Legions wintered.

Iam designati principis, omen erat.
Borne in the Camp, in Fathers wars with soldiers reared was he;

I my self do find among the Records, that Antium was the place of his birth.
PLINY refelleth GETULICUS, as if he made a lie by way of flattery, because to
the praise of a young and glorious Prince, he would fetch some argument and
matter even out of a City consecrated to HERCULES: and was the bolder, as he
says to abuse the said Lie, for that, indeed, a year almost before,
GERMANICUS had a son borne at Tibur, named likewise CAIUS CAESAR: of whose
amiable childhood and untimely death we have spoken before. And as to PLINY
himself, confuted he is by the Calculation of the times. For, they who have
recorded the Acts of AUGUSTUS do all agree, That GERMANICUS was sent into
Germany after the time of his Consulship expired, when as CAIUS was already
borne. Neither can the Inscription of the Altar one jot make good his opinion:
considering that AGRIPPINA was delivered of daughters twice in that Country.
And what childbirth so ever it was, without respect and difference of sex,
called it is Puerperium: For that in old time folk used to name little girls
also PUERAE, like as little boys PUELLI. There is besides, an Epistle of
AUGUSTUS written, not many months before he died unto AGRIPPINA his Niece as
touching this CAIUS, (for there was not now living any other Infant of the like
name) in these words. I have no longer ago than yesterday taken order with
TALARIVS and ASELLIUS, that with the leave of God they bring the boy CAIUS upon
the 15 18 of May.
day before the Calends of June. I send besides with him of mine own servants
a Physician whom GERMANICUS (as I have written unto him) may if he will retain
and keep with him still. Farewell my AGRIPPINA and endeavor to come well and
in health to thy GERMANICUS. It appears I suppose sufficiently that CAIUS
could not in that place be borne, unto which he was conveied from Rome not
before he was well-neere two years old* And as for those verses, these self
same evidences likewise discredit them: and the rather, because they have no
Author. We are to follow therefore the only authority that remains, of the
Records and public Instrument: seeing especially that CAIUS evermore preferred
Antium before all other retiring places, and loved it no otherwise than his
native soil: yea, and by report, was fully minded once (upon a tedious
weariness that he had of Rome City), to transfer thither even the very seat
and habitation of the Empire.

He gat his surname CALIGULA by occasion of a merry word taken up in 9
the Camp, because he was brought up there in the habit of an ordinary ( a)
and common soldier among the rest. With whom, how much besides he was able to
do in love and favor by means of his education and daily feeding with them,
was most of all known; when after the death of AUGUSTUS, he only (no doubt)
with He was then but a child, about 3 or 4 years old*
his very sight and presence quieted them; what time they were in an uprore and
at the very point of furious outrage. For they ceased not to mutiny, until
they perceived that he was about to be sent out of the way for danger of the
sedition, and appointed to the next City adjoining. Then and not before,
turning to repentance, they stayed and held back his coach, and so by prayer
averted the displeasure that was toward them.

He accompanied his Father also in the Expedition into Syria: From whence 10
being returned, first he abode in house with his Mother: and after that she
was banished and sent away, he remained with his great Grandmother LIVIA
AUGUSTA: whom deceased he praised in a funeral Oration at the Rostra, when
he was as yet but a very youth in his Praetexta: and then removed he to his
Grandmother ANTONIA. From her in the twentieth year of his age he was sent
for to Capreae by TIBERIUS, and upon one and the self same day, he did on his
virile ( a) gown and withal cut the first down of his beard, without any
honorable solemnity, such as his brethren before him had at their
Commencements. Here, notwithstanding he was tempted by all the deceitful
trains that they could devise, who would have drawn and forced him to
quarrels, yet gave he never any occasion, having rased out and quite forgotten
the fall and calamity of his mother, brethren and near friends, as if nothing
had befallen to any of them: passing over all those abuses which himself had
endured with incredible dissimulation: so obsequious and double diligent

not without good cause, Passienus was the Author of this Apophthegm.

Howbeit, the cruel disposion and villainous nature of his own, he could not
even then bridle and hold in* but both at all castigations and punishments 11

present: and also would haunt Tavernes and Brothel-houses, men's wives also
suspected for adultery, going about from place to place disguised under a ( a)
peruke of false hair, and in a side (woman's) garment: yea, and most studiously
gave his mind to learn the artificial feate of dancing and singing upon the
Stage. And verily TIBERIUS was well content to wink here at and suffer all,
if happily thereby his fierce and savage nature might have been mollified and
become tractable. Which the old man (as he was a Prince right prudent and one
most quick of sent) had foreseen well enough long before: in so much as diverse
times he gave out and said openly, That CAIUS lived to the destruction of him
and them all: likewise, That he cherished and brought up a very Commonly taken

small degrees arise to the hope of succession in the Empire. Which hope, the
rather to confirm, after his wife aforesaid IUNIA was dead in childbirth, he
solicited unto filthy wantonness dame ENNIA the wife of NAEVIUS MACRO, then

in case he ever attained to the Empire: and for assurance here of he bound it

asleep; * Rapier or spud.
and yet upon mere pity and commiseration bethought himself, flung away the
weapon and so went back again. Neither durst TIBERIUS although he had an
inkling and intelligence of his disguisement, make any in quisition at all of
the matter or proceed to revenge.

Thus having obtained the Empire he procured unto the people of Rome, or 13

that ever were, most wished for of the greatest part of provincial Nations and
of the soldiers, because most of them had known him an infant: and generally
of the whole co^minalty of Rome; in remembrance of his father GERMANICUS, and
upon compassion they took of that house in manner ruinate and extinct. As he
removed therefore from Misenu^, albeit he was clad in mourning weed and
reuere^ly did attend the corpse of TIBERIUS, yet went he among the altars, ( a)
sacrifices and burning torches in a most thick throng and ioifull train of
such as met him on the way: who beside other luckie and fortunate names called
him SIDUS. i. their starr: Pullum. i. their chick, Pupum. i. their babe, and

No sooner was he entered into the city of Rome, but incontine^tly with consent
of the senate and the multitude rushing into the Curia, after they had annulled
the will of TIBERIUS, who in his testame^nt had adjoined coheire unto him
another of his Nephews Tiberius the son of Drujus:
under age, and as yet in his pretexta, permitted he was alone, to have the full
and absolute power of all, and that with such an universal joy, that in three
months space next ensuing and those not fully expired, there were by report
above 160000. Beasts slain for sacrifice. After this, when as within some
few days he passed over by the water but to the next Islands of Campania,
vows were made for his safe return: and no man there was who did let slip the
least occasion offered, to testify what pensive care he took, as touching his
health and safety. But so soon as he was once fallen sick, they all kept

written bills set uppe in public places. To this surpassing love of his own
Citizens and Country men, was adjoined the notable favor also of foraine
states. For, Artabanns King of the Parthians, professing always his hatred and
contempt of TIBERIUS, sought of his own accord to him for amity: yea he came
in person to a conference with one of his legates (or Lieutenants) that had
been Consul, and passing over Euphrates, adored the The maine standards.
Aegles and other military ensigns of the Romans, as also the Images of the
CAESAR'S.

Himself also enkindled and set more on fire the affections of men by all 15
manner of popularitie. When he had with many a tear praised TIBERIUS in a
funeral Oration before the body of the people, and performed the complement
of his obsequies most honorably, forthwith he hastened, to Pandataria and
Pontiae, for to translate from thence the ashes of his mother and brother, and
that in foul and tempestuous wether, to the end that his piety and kindness
might the more be seen. And being come to their relics, very devoutly
himself with his own hands bestowed them in several pitchers with no less
show in pagent wise, having wafted them first to Ostia with a flag (or
streamer) pitched in the poupe or stern of a galley guided by two ranks of
Oars and so forth to Rome up the Tiber, by the ministry of the most
worshipful gentlemen of Rome: he conveyed them within two Fercules (or
frames) devised for the purpose into the Mausoleum; even at noone day when
people were assembled there in great frequencie. In memorial likewise of the^
he ordained yearly dirges and sacrifices to be performed with religious
devotion to their ghosts by the whole City. And more the^ that, he instituted
for his mother solemn games within the Cirque; and a sacred Chariot withal
wherein her Image to the full proportion of her body should be carried in the
pomp. But in remembrance of his father he called the month September,
GERMANICVS. These ceremonial duties done, by virtue of one sole Act of the
Senate, he heaped upon his grandmother ANTONIA whatsoever honors LIVIA
AUGUSTA had received in her whole time. His Uncle CLAUDIUS, a knight of Rome
until that time and no better, he assumed unto him for his Colleague in the
Consulship. His brother His cousin german for such are called brethren.

the Consuls unto the Senators, they should begin in this form, Quod bonum,

therewith, he burnt them. A certain pamphlet presented unto him concerning his
life and safety, he received not, but stood upon this point. That he had done
nothing wherefore he should be odious to any person: saying withal, That he
had no ears open for informers and Tale-bearers.

he expelled forth of Rome, being hardly and with much ado entreated not to
drown them in the deep sea* The writings of TITUS LABIENVS, CORDVS CREMUTIVS
and CASSIVS SEVERUS, which had been called in and abolished by diverse Acts of
the Senate, he suffered to be sought out again, to be in men's hands extant,
and usually to be red: seeing that it concerned him principally and stood him
upon most, to have all actions and deeds delivered unto posterity* The
Breviarie of the Empire, that by AUGUSTUS had been wont to be proposed
openly, but was by TIBERIUS intermitted, he published: Unto the Magistrates he
granted free Jurisdiction, and that there might be no appealing to himself.
The Gentry and knighthood of Rome he reviewed with severity and great
preciseness: yet not without some moderation of his hand. He openly took
from them their Public horses of service.
horses, in whom was found any foul reproach or ignominy: as for those, who
were culpable in smaller matters, he only passed over their names in reading
the Roll. To the end, that the Judges might be eased of their labor, unto
the four former decuries he added a fifth. He gave the attempt likewise to
bring up again the ancient manner of Elections, and to restore unto the
people their free voices. The legacies due by the last will and testament of
AUGUSTUS (although the same was abolished): as also of LIVIA AUGUSTA, which
TIBERIUS had suppressed, * Some read Cent^simam
he caused faithfully and without fraud to be tendered and fully paid. The
exaction called ( a) Ducentesima of all bargains and sales, he remitted
throughout Italy. The losses that many a man had sustained by fire he
supplied: and if to any princes he restored their kingdoms, he adjoined
withal the fruicte and profits also of their rents, customs and imposts
growing to the Crown in the middle time between* as namely, unto ANTIOCHVS
COMAGENVS who had been confiscate and fined in an hundred millians of
Sesterces. And that he might the rather be reputed a favorer of all good
examples, he gave unto a woman, (by condition a libertine) Ostingenta
sestertia. Some read Ostoginta: i. 80000, and this comes nearer to the truth.
800000 Sesterces, for that she being under most grievous and dolorous
torments, concealed yet and would not to die for it, utter a wicked fact
committed by her Patron. For which things, among other honors done unto him
there was decreed for him a ( b) shield of gold, which upon a certain day
every year, the colleges of the Priests should bring into the Capitol,
with the Senate accompanying them, and Noble men's children as well boys as
girls, singing the praises of his virtues in musical verse tuned sweetly in
meeter. Moreover, there passed a decree, that the day one which he began his
Empire, should be called ( c) Palilia, employing thereby, as it were a second
foundation of the City.

He bare four Consulships: the first, from the Calends of Iulie for ij.

the second from the Calends of January, for 30 days: the third unto A. V. C.

The third, he alone entered upon at In France:
Lions: not, as some deem, upon pride or negligence: but because, being
absent, he could not have knowledge that his Colleague died just against the
very day of the Calends. He gave a Congiarium
largess to the people twice, to wit, 300 sesterces to them a piece, and a
most plenteous dinner he made as often unto the Senate and degree of gentlemen,
as also to the wives and children of them both. In the latter dinner of the
twain, he dealt over and above, among the men garments to be worn abroad:
unto the women and children, Fascias: Some expound these to be ribbands garters
and gorgets.
gardes welts, or laces, of purple and violet color. And to the end, he might
augment the public joy of the City with perpetuity also; he annexed unto
the feast Saturnalia one day more, and named the same ^nvenalis.

He set forth games of Sword-fencers, partly in the Amphitheater of TAVRVS, 18
and partly within the Septa in Mars field, into the which he inserted and
brought in, certain troops of African and Campane Champions to skirmish by
companies. even the very best, selected out of both Countries. Neither was he
always himself president at these solemnities and public shows, but
otherwhiles enjoined the Magistrates or else his friends to take the charge of
presidencie. As for stage plays, he exhibited them continually in diverse
places and in sundry sorts: once also in the night season, burning lights
throughout the City. He skattered likewise and flung (among the common
people) missils, of many and sundry kinds to skamble for: and dealt man by man,
paniers with viandes therein. At which feasting, to a certain gentleman of *

Rome who over against him plied his chawesfull merrily, and fed right heartily
with a greedy stomach, he sent his own part: as also to a Senator for the
same cause, his letters patents, wherein he declared him extraordinarily,
Praetour. He represented besides, many Cirq-games, which held from morn to
even: interposing one while, the baiting of Or Leopards
Panthers; another while the Troie-justing and Turnament. But some especial
sports there were above the rest, and then the Cirq-place was laid all over
with Red and green

Furthermore, he devised a new kind of sight, and such as never was heard 19
of before: For, over the middle An arm of the se^
Space between Baiae and the huge piles or dammes at Puteoli containing three
miles and 600 paces well near, he made a bridge: having gotten together from
all parts ships of burden, and placed them in a duple course at Anchor, with a
bank of earth cast thereupon, direct and straight after the fashion of the
high way Appia. Upon this bridge he passed to and fro for two days together:
the first day mounted one a courser richly trapped, himself most brave and
goodly to be seen with a chaplet of Oke-brances: armed with a battle axe, a
light sargnet and a sword, clad also in a cloak of gold: the morrow after he
appeared in the habit of a Chariotier, ryding in a chariot drawn with two
goodly steedes of an excellent race: carrying before him DARIUS a boy, one of
the Parthian hostages with a train of the Praetorian soldiers marching after
in battle raie: and accompanied with the Cohort of his minions in Essodis,
^elgick or French.
British wagons, Most men I wot well, are of opinion that CAIUS invented such
a kind of bridge, in emulation of XERXES, who not without the wonder of the
world, made a bridge, of planks over Hellesponte an arm of the Sea, somewhat
narrower than this: others, that by a brute blazed abroad of some huge and
monstrous piece of work, he might terrify Germany and Britain, upon which
countries he meant to make war. But I remember well that being a boy, I
heard my Grandfather report and tell the cause of this work, as it was
delivered by his own Courteours, who were more inward with him than the rest:
namely, That THRASYLLUS the great Astrologer assured TIBERIUS when he was
troubled in mind about his successor, and more inclined to his natural and
lawful Tiberius, the son of Drus^. Tiberius the Emperors son.

than able torun^e a course to and fro on horseback, through the gulf of

as also a solemn contention for the prise in Eloquence both Greek and Latin.

overcome, conferred rewards upon the winners, yea and were forced to make

21 The buildings left half undone by TIBERIUS, namely, the Temple of
AUGUSTUS, and the Theater of POMPEIUS, he finished. He began moreover a
conduict in the Tiburtine territory: and an Amphitheatre near unto the
Enclosure called Septa: Of the two works, the The Co^duict
one was ended by his successor CLAUDIUS, the other was forlet and given over
quite. The walls at Saracose by the injury of time decayed and fallen down
were by him reedified: and the temples of the gods there, repaired. He had
fully purposed also to build a new the palace of Polycrates at Samos: to finish
APOLLOES temple called Didymeum at Miletum: as also to found and build a City
upon the top of the Alps: but before all to dig through the Isthmus in Achaia:
and thither had he sent already one of purpose, who had been a principal
Captain of a Cohort in the Vaward to take measure of the work.

already above the height and state both of Principum, for the Roman

challenge unto himself a divine Majesty: and having given order and
commission, that the images of the gods, which either for devout worship done
unto them, or for curious workmanship seen upon them, excelled the rest,

unto Rome, that when their heads were taken of, he might set his The portraict

were who saluted him by the name of JUPITER LATIALIS. Moreover he ordained a

were these fowls ( b) Phaenicopteri, Peacocks, ( d) Tetraones, ( e) Numidicae,
( f) Meleagrides and ( g) Phesants, and those to be sorted by their kinds; and
so every day killed. And uerily, his usual manner was in the night to call
unto the Moon when she was at full and shining bright out for to come and ly
with him in his arms: but in the day time, he talked secretly and apart with
JUPITER CAPITOLINUS: one while by whispering and rounding one another in the

in threatening wise to utter these words (...), I will remove and translate thee

daigned he her any honor, but out of his dining chamber beheld her funeral

24 With all his sisters, he used ordinarily to be naught: and at any great
feast he placed evermore one or other of them by turns beneath himself,
while his wife sat above. Of these sisters (as it is verily thought) he
defloured DRUSILLA being a virgin, when himself also was yet under age and a
very boy: Yea, and one time above the rest he was found in bed with her and
taken in the manner by his Grandmother ANTONIA; in whose house they were
brought up both together. Afterward also when she was bestowed in marriage
upon LUCIUS CASSIUS LONGINUS, a man of Consulare degree, he took her from him
and kept her openly, as if she had been his own lawful wife. Also when he
lay sick, he ordained her to be both heir of all his goods and Successor
also in the Empire. For the same sister deceased, he proclaimed a general
cessation To signify a solemn mourning:

to have laughed, bathed, or supped together with parents, wife or children. And
being impatient of this sorrow, when he was fled suddenly and by night out of

thence returned speedily again with his beard and hair of head overgrowne.

neither with so tender affection nor so good respect as who^ he oftentimes
prostituted and offered to be abused by his own stale catamites. So much the
more easily therefore condemned he them in the case of AEMILIUS LEPIDUS, as
adulteresses and privy to his treasons and waite-layings addressed against his
person. And he not only divulged the hand-writings which were sought out by
guile and adulteries, but also consecrated unto MARS REVENGER those three

25 As for his marriages, a man may hardly discern, whether he contracted,
dissolved, or held them still with more dishonesty. LIVIA ORESTILLA, what time
she was wedded unto C. PISO, himself, (being one who came in person to the
Solemnization of the marriage), commanded to be brough home unto him as his

presently had her away with him from the table: and the next day published by

made themselves away. The Consuls had forgot by chance to publish by
proclamation his Birth day; For which, he deprived them of their magistracy:
and so for three days space the Commonwealth was without the sovereign ( b)

against him, he caused to be scourged: and the clothes out of which he was
stripped to be put under the Soldiers feet, that they might stand more

Storehouses from them. * (...).


27 The cruelty of his nature he showed by these examples most of all. When
Cattle which were to feed wild beasts prepared for baiting, grew to be sold
very dear, he appointed malefactors found guilty to be slaughtered for that
purpose. And in taking the review of Goales and prisoners therein, as they were
sorted according to their offenses: he, without once looking upon the title and
cause of their imprisonment, standing only within a gallerie, commanded al in
the mids, a calvu^ ad calvu^ ( a) ^. from one bald-pate to another, to be led
forth * Medios, ^ (...) ad calrum.
to execution. He exacted of him the performance of a vow, who had promised to
do his devoir in public sword-fight for the recoverie of his health: and him
he beheld fighting at sharp: neither dismissed he him before he was victour,
and after many prayers. Another there was, who for the same cause had vowed to
die. This man being not very forward to pay his vow, he caused to be dight
with sacred herbs, and adorned with Ribbands.
Infules, like a sacrifice; and so delivered him into the hands of boys: who
calling hard upon him for the discharge o^ his vow, should course and drive him
through the streets of the City, until he were thrown headlong down the

Rampire. Many honest Citizens of good calling and estate, after he had first
disfigured with marks of branding yrons, he condemned to dig in mines, and to
make highways, or to encounter with beasts: or kept them creeping with all
four like brute beasts within a cage for the nonce: or else slit them through
the mids with a saw. And those whom he thus served, were not all of them
guilty of any grievous offenses: but sufficient it was, if they had a base
conceit and spoke but meanly of some show that he exhibited: or because they
had never sworn stoutly by his These (...), are of a middle essence, be tweene

Tutelar angel or spirit of the Prince: For the manner of the Romans was in
flattering wise, thus to swear, as also by the health the life, the honor of

Genius. Parents he forced to be present at the execution of their own
children. And when one Father excused himself by reason of sickness, he sent
a Licter for him: another of them immediately after the heavy spectacle of his
son put to death, he invited to his own ( c) bourd; made him great cheer,
and by all manner of courtesy provoked him to iocondnesse and mirth. The
Master of his sword-fights and beast baitings, he caused for certain days
together to be beaten with ( d) chains in his own sight: but killed him not
quite, before himself could no longer abide the stench of his brain by this
time putrified. A Poet, the Author of Atellan^ Enterludes, for a verse that he
made implying a jest, which might be doubly taken, he burnt at a stake in the
very middle shew-place of the Amphitheatre. A Gentleman of Rome, whom he had
cast before wild beasts, when he cried out, That he was innocent, he commanded
to be brought back* and after he had cut out his tongue, sent him among them
again, (to fight for his life or to be devoured).

Having recalled one from exile which had been long banished, he demanded 28
of him, what he was wont to do there? who made answer thus by way of
flattery, I prayed quoth he, to the Gods always that TIBERIUS Who had
banished him
( as now it is come to posse) might perish, and you become Emperor. Hereupon
CALIGULA weening that those whom he had banished prayed likewise for his death,

he entered into the Curia, should call him enemy to the State, and so lay
violent hands upon him: and when they had with their ( a) writing yrons all to

bewailed in an Edict as most cruel, and also cursed them that endured to see
the sight.

31 He was wont moreover to complain openly of the condition of his time
wherein he lived, as not renowned by any public calamities: Whereas the reign
of AUGUSTUS was memorable for the overthrow of VARUS: that of TIBERIUS ennobled
by the fall of scaffolds in the Theater at Fidenae. As for himself, like he
was to be forgotten, (such was the prosperity in his days). And evermore he
wished the carnage and execution of his armies. Famine, Pestilence, and
Skarfires, or some opening chinks of the ground.

32 Even whiles he was at his recreations and disports, whiles he set his mind
upon gaming and feasting, the same cruelty practiced he both in word and deed.
Oftentimes as he sat at dinner or banquetted, were serious matters examined
in his very sight by way of torture: and the Soldier that had the skill and
dexterity to behead folk, then and there used to cut off the heads of any
prisoners indifferently without respect. At Puteoli, when he dedicated the
bridge, which as we noted before, was his own invention: after he had invited
many unto him from the shore and strond, suddenly he turned them all headlong
over the bridge into the water. And seeing some of them taking hold of the For

executed; namely to have his hands cut off, and hung about his neck just before
his breast with a written Title carried before him declaring the cause of this
his punishment; and so to be led round about all the companies as they sat at
meat. One of these Fencers called Or secutores, aforesaid.
MIRMILLONES, coming out of the Fence-schoole played at wooden wasters with
him; and there took a fall for the nonce, and lay along at his feet: him he
stabbed for his labor, with a short iron skeine that he had: and withal,
after the solemn manner of Victors, ran up and down with his garland of
Date tree branches. There was a beast brought to the Altar ready to be killed
for Sacrifice: he comes girt in habit of these At sacrifice.
Beast slayers, and with the axe head that he lifted up on high, knocked down
the Minister himself, who was addressed to cut the said beasts throat, and so
dashed his brains out. At a plenteous feast where there was great cheer, he
set up all at once an unmeasurable laughter: And when the Consuls who sat just
by him asked gently and with fair language, Whereat he laughed so? At what
else, quoth he, but this, That with one nod of my head, I can have both your
throats cut immediately.

33 Among diverse and sundry jests and merry conceits of his, as he stood once
hard by the image of JUPITER, he demanded of APELLES an actour of Tragaedies,
whether of the twain he thought to be the greater and more stately, JUPITER or
himself? And whiles he made some stay ere he answered, he all to tare and

34 Neither raged he with less envy and spiteful malice, than pride and
cruelty, against persons, in manner, of all times and ages. The Statues of
brave and worthy men brought by AUGUSTUS out of the Capitol Courtyard for the
straightness of the place, into Mars-field, he overthrew and cast here and
there in such sort, as they could not be set up again with the Titles and
Inscriptions whole forbidding that ever after there should be any where Statue

all of a sudden, for no other cause in the World but for that as he entered
into the Theater to see the shows and games there exhibited, he perceived him
to have turned the eyes of all the people upon him, with the resplendent

bush of hair grown long, so often as they came in his way, he disfigured by
shaving their heads all behind. There was one ESIUS PROCULUS (whose father had
been a principal captain of the foremost cohort) for his exceeding tall

suddenly to be pulled down from the scaffold where he sat, and to be brought

love so notorious of PIRALLIS that common and prostitute strumpet, there was
not lightly a dame or wife of any worship and reputation, that he forbear.
And those for the most part would he inuit together with their husbands to
supper: and as they passed by at his feet, peruse and consider curiously;
taking leisure thereto after the manner of those that cheapen and buy wares in
ouvert market: yea and with his hand chocke them under the chin and make them
to look up, if happily any of them in modesty and for bashfulnesse held down
their faces. And then so often as he listed, out he goes from the refection
room, and when he had called her unto him apart that liked him best, he would
within a little after: (even whiles the tokens were yet fresh testifying their
wanton work) return: and openly before all the company, either praise or
dispraise her: reckoning up every good or bad part of body and action in that
brutish business. To some of them, himself sent bills of divorsement in the
name of their husbands absent and commanded the same to be set upon the file
and stand in public record.

In riotous and wastfull ( a) expense, he outwent the wits and inventions of 37
all the prodigal spend thrifts that ever were; as having devised a new found
manner and use of baines, together with most strange and monstrous kinds of
meats and meals: namely, to bath with hot and cold Or Oiles
ointments: to drink off and quaffe most precious and costly pearls dissolved
in vinegar: to set upon the bourd at feasts loaves of bread and other viands
to them before his guests, all of gold, saying commonly withal, That a man
must either be frugall or else CAESAR. Moreover for certain days together, he
flung and scattered among the common people from the Lovuer of the stately Hall
IULIA, money in pieces of no mean ualew. He built moreover tall galiaces of
ceder ( b) timber, with poupes and sternes beset with precious stones, carrying
sails of sundry colors containing in them barnes large galleries, walking
places, and dining chambers of great receipt: with vines also and trees bearing
apples and other fruit in as much variety: wherein he would sit feasting in
the uery day time among quires of musicians and melodious singers, and so sail
along the costs of Campania. In building of stately Palaces and manor houses
in the country he cast aside all rules and orders as one desirous to do
nothing so much as that which was thought unpossible to be done. And therefore
he laid foundations of piles where the sea was most raging and deep withal, and
hewed rocks of most hard flint and rag: plains also he raised even with
mountains and by digging down hill tops levelled them equal with the plains:
all with incredible celeritie: as punishing those who wrought but slowly even
with death. In sum, (and not to reckon up every thing in particular) That
infinite wealth and mass of Treasure which TIBERIUS CAESAR left hehind him
valued at Vicies ac septies millies
2700. millians of Sesterces, he consumed to nothing, before one whole year
was gone about.

Being exhaust therefore and grown exceeding bare, he turned his mind to 38
rapine and polling by sundry and most nice points; of forged calumniation, of
sales, of imposts and taxes. He affirmed plainly, that those held not by law
and rightfully the freedom of Rome City, whose Ancestors had obtained the
grant thereof in these terms, to them and their posterity: unless they were
sons: For, by Posteri. i. Posterity quoth he, ought to be understood none

wrong certificate of their estates, unto whom there had accrued afterward
(upon what cause soever) any increase of substance. The last wills and
testamentes of such as had been principal Centurions of the foremost Cohorts,
as many I say, as from the beginning of TIBERIUS Empire, had left neither the
said TIBERIUS, nor himself Heir, he canciled for their unthankfulness: of
all the rest likewise, he held the wills as void, and of none effect: in case
any person would come forth and say, that they purposed and intended, at their
death to make CAESAR their Heir. Upon which fear that he put men in, being
now both by unknowen persons unto him, nominated Heir among their familiar
friends, and also by parents among their children, he termed them all mockers
and cousiners, for that after such nuncupative wills they continued still alive:
and to many of them he sent certain M^cteas or Mattyas, such as Marchpanes
dainties empoisoned. Now such causes as these above-saide he heard judicially
debated: having before hand set down a certain rate and sum of money, for
the raising whereof he sat iudicially in Court: and when that sum was fully
made up, then and not before he would arise. And (as he was one who in no wise
could abide any little delay) he condemned upon a time by virtue of one
definitive sentence above forty persons, liable to judgment for diverse and
sundry crimes: making his boast withal unto his wife CAESONIA newly wakened
out of her sleep What a deal he had done, while she toooke her noones repose.
Having published an open port sale of the residue remaining of furniture
provided to set out all shows and games, he caused the said parcels to be
brought forth and sold: setting the prices thereof himself and enhaunsing the
same to such a prick, that some men enforced to buy certain things at an
extreme and exceeding rate (whereby they were impoverished and stripped of all
their goods) cut their own veins and so bled to death. Well known it is that
whiles APONIUS SATURNINUS took a nap and slept among the seats and stauls
where these sales were held; CAIUS put the Or Crier.

price whiles he sat and nodded still, until there were fastened upon the man,
(ignorant God wot, altogether of any such matter) thirteen sword-fensers, at

sisters by him condemned; their servants also and uerie children at excessive
high prices: finding sweetness in the gain growing thereupon and thereby
drawn on to proceed in that course, look what furniture belonged to the old
imperial Court, he sent for it all from the City of Rome* For the carriage
whereof, he took up even the passengers wagons that usually were hired, yea
the uery jades which served In grinding Corn, and carrying brea^
mils and backe-houses: In so much, as many times there wanted bread in Rome:
and a number of Termers, such as had matters depending in law, for that they
could not make their appearance in Court at their days appointed, by absence
lost their suits. For the selling of which furniture, there was no fraud, no
guile, no deceitful allurement to be devised that he used not: one while
checking each one for their avarice, and rating them because they were not
ashamed to be richer than he: otherwhiles making semblance of repentance, in
that he permitted persons to have the buying of such things as belongd to the
Empire. Intelligence was given unto him, that a certain wealthy and
substantial man in that province, had paid 200000. sesterces unto his
officers (who had the bidding of guests unto his own table) that by some
subtle shift, himself might be foisted in among other guests: neither was he
disco^te^ted that the honor of supping with him was prized so high. The morrow
after therefore, as this provincial man was sitting at a public portsale, he
sent one of purpose to tender and deliver unto him some frivolous trifle (I wot
not what) at the price of 200000 sesterces: and withal to say unto him, That
take a supper he should with CAESAR, as a guest invited by his own self.

He levied and gathered new tributes and imposts, such as never were heard 40
of before: at the first by the hands of Publicanes; and afterward (by reason
of the excessive gains that came in) by the Centurions and Tribunes of the
Pretorian cohorts. For he omitted no kind of thing, no manner of person, but he
imposed some tribute upon them. For all cates that were to be sold throughout
the City, there was exacted a certain taxation and set payment, For actions
for suits, for judgeme^ts whersoever co^mensed or drawn in writing, the
fortieth part of the whole sum in suite went to his share in the name of a
tribute: not without a penalty, in case any one were convinced, to have
either grown to composition or given the thing in question. The eighth part of
the poor porters and Cariers daies-wages: out of the gets also and takings of
common strumpets, as much as they earned by once lying with a man, was paid
nomine tributi. Moreover to the chapter of the law, this branch was annexed
that there should be liable to this tribute, not only the parties themselves

houses of bawderie: As also that Nec (...) ^t (...) ob^ ^ssent. Some interpret

wedded persons should pay for their use of marriage.

After these and such like taxes were denounced by proclamation, but not yet 41
published abroad in writing, when as through ignorance of the written law (
a) many trespasses and transgressions were committed: at length, upon instant
demand of the people, he proposed indeed the act, but written in very small
letter and within as narrow a place, so that no man might exemplify the same
or copy it out. And to the end that there might be no kind of spoil and
pillage which he attempted not, he setup a stews and brothelhouse in the very
Palace, with many rooms and chambers therein distinguished asunder, and
furnished according to the dignity and worth of that place. In it there stood
to prostitute themselves, married wives, youths and springals free borne. Then
sent he all about to the frequented places as well markets as Halles of resort,
certain Nomenclatours, to inuit and call thither by name, young men and old,
for to fulfill and satisfy their lust. All comers at their entrance paid
money (as it were) for usurie and interest. Certain persons also were
appointed to take note in open sight, of their names, as ofsuch as were good
friends increasing the revenewes of CAESAR. And not disdeining so much as the
lucre and vantage arising out of hazard and dice play, he gained the more by
cogging, lying, yea and forswearing (of gamesters). And upon a time, having put
over to his next fellow gamester his own course, to cast the dice for him in
his turn: out he goes into the court-yeard and foregate of the house: where,
having espied two wealthy gentlem^ of Rome passing by, he commanded them to be
apprehended incontinently, and condemned in the confiscation of their goods:
which done he returned in again, leaping for joy and making his vaunt, That he
never had a luckier hand at dice.

But when he had once a daughter borne, complaining then of his poverty 42
and the heavy charges that lay upon him not only as Emperor, but also as a
father, he gently took the uoluntarie contributions and benevolence of men
toward the finding of the girl her food, as also for her Dowry another day. He
declared also by an edict, that he would receive newyeares gifts: and so he
stood the first Or a Kalendis (...) the first day, etc.
day of January, in the porch or entry of his house PALATINE, ready to take
what pieces soever of money came, which the multitude of all sorts and degrees,
with full hands and Or laps of their clothes
bosoms poured out before him. Finally, so far was he incensed with the
desire of handling money, that oftentimes he would both walk barefooted up
and down, yea and wallow also a good while with his whole body upon huge heaps
of coined gold pieces, spread here and there in a most large and open place.

In military matters and warlike affairs he never dealt but once: and that 43
was not upon any intended purpose: but what time as he had made a progress to
Mevania, for to see the sacred grove and river of Clitumnus; being put in mind
to supply and make up the number of the Batauians whom he had about him for his
guard, it took him in the head to make an expedition into Germany. Neither
deferred he this disignement, but having levied from al parts a power
consisting of legions and auxiliarie forces; and taken musters most rigorously
in every quarter, as also raised and gathered together uictuals and provision
of al sorts in that quantity, as never any other before him the like, he put
himself on his journey. Wherein he marched, one while in such hurrie and
haste, as that the Pretorian cohorts were forced (against the manner and
custom) to bestow their ensigns upon the sumpter beasts backs and so to
follow after: otherwhiles, after such a slow and delicate manner, as that he
would be carried in a litter upon eight men's shoulders, and exact of the common
people inhabiting the neighbor cities adjoining, that the high ways might be
swept and watered for the dust, against his coming.

After that he was arrived once at the camp, to the end that he might show 44
himself a sharp and severe Captain. Those Lieutenants who had brought aid
with the latest, out of diverse and dissituate parts, he discharged with
ignominy and shame. But in the reuiew of his army the most part of the
Centurions who had already served out their complete time, yea and some whose
term within uery few days would have been fully expired, he deprived of
their places: to wit, the leading of the foremost bands, finding fault forsooth
with the old age and feebleness of every one. As for the rest, after he had
given them a rebuke for their avarice, he abridged the fees and availes due for
their service performed; and brought that same down to the value of 6000.
sesterces. And having achieved no greater exploit, than taken to his mercy,
ADMINIUS the son of CINOBELLINUS King of the Batavorum,. i. the Batavorians.
Britains, who being by his father banished, was fled over sea with a small
power and train about him, he sent magnificent and glorious letters to Rome,
as if the whole Isle had been yielded into his hands: warning and willing the
carriers ever and anon, to ride forward in their wagon directly into the market
place and the Curia, and in no wise to deliver the said messives but in the
Temple of MARS unto the Consuls, and that in a frequent assembly of the Senate.

Soon after, when there failed matter of war, he commanded a few Germans of
the De Custodia, or that were prisoners and in ward
Corpse de guard, to be transported and hidden on the other side of 45
Rhene, and that news should be reported unto him after dinner in most
tumultuous manner, That the enemy was come: which done, he made what haste he
could, and together with some of his friends and part of the Pretorian horsemen
he entered the next wood: where after he had cut off the heads of trees and
adorned their bodies in manner of Tropaees, he returned into the Camp by
torch-light. As for those uerily who followed him not in this service; he
reproved and checked them for their timorousness and cowardice: But his
companions and partners in this douty uictorie, he rewarded with a new kind and
as strange a name of Coronets: which being garnished and set out with the
express form of Sun, Moons, and Stars he called ( a) Exploratorias. Again,

away perforce out of the Grammar school, and privily sent before, he suddenly
left his supper, and with his men of arms pursued them as runawaies, and
being overtaken and caught again he brought them back as prisoners bound in
chains; showing himself even in this interlude also, beyond all measure
insolent and intemperate. Now after he was come back to supper, those who
brought him word that the battles were rallied and come forward in safety,
he exhorted to sit down to meat armed as they were in their Corselets: yea
and advertised them out of that most vulgar Verse of VIRGIL. Durarent,
Secundisque rebuise seruarent.. i.

Still to endure in all assayes
And keep themselves for better days.
Moreover, amid these affairs, he rebuked most sharply in a proclamation, the
Senate and people both, in their absence: For that whiles CAESAR fought
battles and was exposed to so many perils, they could so unseasonably
celebrate feasts, haunt also the Cirque, The Theaters, and their retyring
places of solace and pleasure.

Last of all, as if he meant now to make a final dispatch for ever of the war
46
having embattailed his army upon the Ocean shore, planted his balists and
other engines of Artillery in their several places, (and no man wist the while
or could imagine what he went about) all at once he commanded them to gather
fish-shels, and therewith to fill their headpeeces and laps, tearming them the
spoils of the Ocean, due to the Capit^l, and the Palatium. In token also and
memorial of this brave uictorie, he raised an exceeding high turret, out of
which as from a watch-towre, there might shine all night long lights and fires
for the better direction of ships at sea in their course. And after he had
pronounced publicly a donative to his Soldiers, even an hundred good Deniers
a piece; as if thereby he had surmounted all former precedents of liberality,
* As if with 3 l. 2 S 6 pence, they had been made for ever.
Now go your ways, quoth he, with joy, Go your ways Isay, enriched and
wealthy.

47 Turning his mind after this to the care of his Triumph, he selected and
set apart for the pomp (over and above the Captives and runnagate Barbarians)
the tallest men of Stature also that were to be found in Gaul: and every one
that (as he said himself) was axiothriambentos, that is, worthy to be seen
in a Triumph, yea and some of the Nobles and principal persons of that Nation:
Whom he compelled not only to color the hair of their heads yellow like
burnished gold, and to wear the same long: but also to learn the Germans
language, and to bear barbarous names. He gave commandment also; that the
Galleys with three ranks of Oars, wherein he had embarked and entered the
Ocean, should be convaied to Rome, a great part of the way by land. He wrote
likewise unto his procuratours and Officers, To provide the furniture of his
triumph, with as little cost as might be: but yet the same in as ample manner
as never before was the like, seeing they had both might and right to seize all
men's goods into their hands.

48 Before his departure out of that Province, he intended the execution of an
horrible and abominable designement; even to put to sword those Legions, which
long a go upon the decease of AUGUSTUS, had made a commotion: because,
forsooth, they had beset both his father GERMANICUS their Captain, and
himself also, then an Infant. And being hardly and with much a-doe reclaimed
from such a rash and inconsiderate project, yet could he by no means be
stayed: but stiffly persisted in a full mind and will to (...) To kill every

tith them. When he had summoned them therefore to a public assembly,
unarmed, and without their swords which they had put off and bestowed here and
there, he environed them with his Cavallerie all armed. But seeing once, that
many of them suspecting where-about he went, slipped away in sundry places for
to resume their weapons if any violence were offered, himself abandoned the
assembly and fled, taking his direct way immediately to the City of Rome;
diverting all his bitterness and cruelty upon the Senate: Whom, (to avert
from himself the odious rumors of so great and shameful villainies) he
openly threatened; complaining among other matters that he was by them defrauded
and put by his just and due triumph: whereas, himself but a little before, had
intimated and denounced upon pain of death, that they should not make nor
meddle in any matter about his honors.

49 Being encountered therefore and met upon the way by Ambassadors from that
most honorable Of Senators
Order, entreating him to make speed: with a most loud voice, Come I will,
quoth he, I will come, I say and this with me here, beating often upon the
swords Or haft*

returned in deed, but it was to them alone who wished it, namely, The degree
of Gentlemen and the common people. For himself would be no longer a Citizen
or Prince to the Senate. He commanded moreover, That not one of the Senators
should meet him. And thus, either omitting quite or putting of his triumph,
he entered the City riding ovant, upon his very birthday: and within four
months after came to his end, having attempted and done notable outrages and
very great villainies, but plotting still and practicing much greater. For he
had purposed to remove his imperial Court to Antium, and afterward to
Alexandria: but having massacred first the most choice and chief persons of

degrees. And that no man may seem to doubt hereof, there were in his secret
Cabinet found two books bearing diverse titles. The one had for the Inscription
Gladius. i. the sword: the other, Pugio, that is to say, the dagger. They
contained both of them the marks and names of such as were appointed to death.
There was found besides, a big chest full of diverse and sundry poisons, which
soon after being by CLAUDIUS drowned in the Seas, infected and poisoned the
same, not without the deadly bane of fishes killed therewith, which the tide
cast up to the next shores.

50 Of Stature he was very tall, pale and wan-coloured: of body gross and
without all good making: his neck and shanks exceeding slender: his eyes sunk
in his head, and his temples hollow, his forehead broad, and the same furrowed
and frowning: the hair of his head growing thin, and none at all about his
crown: in all parts else hairie he was and shagged. It was therefore taken for
an heinous and capital offense, either to look upon him as he passed by from
an higher place, or once but to name a Goat upon any occasion whatsoever. His
face and visage being naturally stern and grim, he made of purpose more
crabbed and hideous: composing and dressing it at a lookingglasse, all manner
of ways to seem more terrible and to strike greater fear. He was neither
healthful in body nor stood sound in mind; Being a child, much troubled with

able to go, to stand, to arise, to recover himself and to bear up his head.
The infirmity of his mind, both himself perceived, and oftentimes also was
minded to go aside (unto An Isle, where grew the best Ellebor, a purgative
meet ^or lunaticke and distracted persons.
Anticyra), there to purge his brain thoroughly. It is for certain thought,
that poisoned he was with a Potion given unto him by his wife CAESONIA: Which
in deed was a love Or drink.
medicine, but such an one, as cracked his wits and enraged him. He was troubled
most of all with Insomnia
want of sleep; For, he slept not above three hours in a night: and in those
verily he took no quiet repose, but fearful; and skared with strange
illusions and fantastical imaginations: as who among the rest, dreamed upon a
time that he saw the very form and resemblance of the sea talking with him.
And hereupon for a great part of the night, what with tedious wakefulnesse and
weariness of lying, one while sitting up in his bed, another while roaming and
wandering too and fro in his Galleries (which were of an exceeding length) he
was wont to call upon and look still for the daylight.

51 I should not do amiss, if unto this minds sickness of his I attributed
the vices which in one and the same Or person
subject were of a most different nature: to wit, excessive confidence, and
contrariwise, overmuch fearfulness. For, he that set so light by the Gods
and despised them as he did, yet at the least ( a) thunder and lightning, used
to wink close with both eyes, to enwrap also and cover his whole head: but if
the same were greater and somewhat extraordinary, to start out of his bed, to
creep and hide himself under the bedsteede. During his peregrination verily
and travail through Sicilie, after he had made but a scorn and mockery at
the miracles and strange fights in many parts there, he fled suddenly by
night from Messana, as affrighted with the smoke and rumbling noise of the top
of Aetna. And he that against the Barbarians was so full of threats and
menaces, when as beyond the river Rhene he rode in a Germans Chariot between
the Streights, and the Army marched in thick squadrons together: by occasion
only that one said, There would be no small trouble and hurliburly, in case
the enemy from any place appeared in sight: forthwith he mounted on
horseback and turned hastily to the bridges: but finding them full of
Camp-slaves and cariages wherewith they were Or guarded*
choked as one impatient of any delay, he was from hand to hand and over men's
heads conveied to the other side of the water. Soon after likewise, hearing of
the revolt and rebellion of Germany, he provided to fly; and for the better
means of flight, prepared and rigged ships: resting and staying himself
upon his only comfort; That he should yet have Provinces beyond sea remaining
for him, in case the Conquerours following the train of their victory, either
seized the Hill tops of the Alps (as sometimes the Cimbrians), or possessed
themselves of the very City of Rome, as the Senones in times past did.
Hereupon I verily believe that the murderers of him afterward devised this
shift, namely to hold up his Soldiers with a loud lie when they were in an
uprore, and to bear them in hand that he laid violent hands on himself,
affrighted at the fearful news of the field lost.

52 As for his apparel, his shoes and other habit, he wore them neither
after his own Country-guise, nor in a civil fashion, no nor so much as in
manlike manner, nor yet always, I may tell you, sorting with the state and
condition of a mortal wight. Being clad oftentimes in cloakes of needleworke
and embroidred with diverse colors, and the same set out with precious stones:
in a coat also with long sleeves: and wearing bracelets withal, he would
come abroad into the City. Sometime you should see him in his silks, and
veiled all over in a loose mantle of fine Lawne or Tiffame.
Sendall with a train: one while going in Greekish Or Pantofle^
slippers, or else in buskins: otherwhiles in a simple pair of broges or high
shoes, such as common Soldiers employed in espiall used. Now and then also

pumps. But for the most part he showed himself abroad with a golden ( a)
beard carrying in his hand either a ( b) thunderbolt or a three-tined ( c) mace,
or else a warder * With three grains like an ele spear;
or rod called ( d) Caduceus (the ensigns all and ornaments of the Gods) yea

ensigns he used verily to wear and bear them continually, even before any
warlike expedition: and sometime the cuirace withal of K. ALEXANDER the great,
fetched out of his Sepulcher and monument.

Of all the liberal Sciences, he gave his mind least to deep literature and
53
found learning: but most, to eloquence: (...) is facundus: or, ^ being very
fair (...). etc
albeit he was (by nature) faire-spoken and of a ready tongue. Certes if it had
been to plead and declame against one, were he angered once, he had both words
and sentences at will. His action, gesture and voice also served him well: in
so much as for very heat and earnestness of speech, uneth was he able to
stand his ground and keep still in one place, yet might he be heard
nothlesse of them that stood a far off. When he was about to make an
Oration, his manner was to threaten in these terms, Namely, That he would draw
forth and let drive at his adversary the keen weapon and dart of his
night-studie by candle light; contemning the milder and more piked kind of
writing so far forth, as that he said of S^NECA, a writer in those days
most accepted, That his compositions which he made were plain exercises to be
showed only: and was no better himself, than sand without lime. His wont was
also, to answer by writing the Orations of those Orators who had pleaded well
and with applause: to meditate and devise as well accusations and defenses of
great persons and weighty matters in the Senate; and according as his style
framed, either to over-charge and depresse, or to ease and relieve every man
with his sentence: having called thither by virtue of his Edicts, the degree
also of Gentlemen to hear him speak.

cause proclaimed he (as it is thought) a wake or Vigile all night long, that
very day on which he was murdered, but that by taking the opportunity of the
nights licentiousness, he might therewith begin to enter upon the Stage. And
diverse times daunced he by night: But once above the rest, having raised out of
their beds three honorable persons that had been Consuls, and sent for them
at the relief of the second watch into the Palace; whiles they were much
afraid and doubted some extremity he caused them to be placed aloft upon a
scaffold, and then suddenly with a great noise of hantbors and sound of
shawlmes or Cimbals, out comes he leaping forth with a palle and cassocke
reaching down to his ankles; and after he had daunced out the measures to a
song, vanished and went his way again. Now, this man so apt a scholar as he

he was dancing or acting a part, made never so little noise and interrupted

hand scourged him. A Gentleman of Rome chanced to keep some stir whiles the
said MNESTER was upon the Stage: unto him he sent word peremptorily by a
Centurion to depart without delay, and go down to Ostia (there to take Sea)
and so to carry unto King PTOLOMAEUS as far as into Mauritania his letters in
writing tables, The tenor whereof was this, To this bearer, whom I have sent

whiles he lived: and a sepulcher when he was dead. And why might not this brair

Chariotdriver, he bestowed in hospital gifts at a certain banquet, two
millions of sesterces. To one of their Chariot-steedes named Incitatus, for
whose sake (because he should not be disquieted), he was wont the day before
the games Circenses, by his Soldiers to command the neighbors there
adjoining to keep silence, besides a Stable all built of marble stone for him,
and a manger made of Ivorie: over and above his caparison also and harnois of
purple, together with a brooch or pendant Jewel of precious stones at his
poictrell: he allowed an house and family of servants, yea and household stuff
to furnish the same: all to this end, that guests invited in his name might be
more finely and gaily entertained. It is reported moreover that he meant to
prefer him unto a Consulship.

56 As he rioted thus and fared outragiously, many there were who wanted no
heart and good will to assault his person. But after one or two conspiracies
detected, when others for default of opportunity held-of and made stay, two at
length complotted and imparted one unto the other their designment, yea and
performed it; not without the privitie of the mightiest freed-men about him,
and the Capitaines of his Guard. The reason was, for that they also, being
nominated (although untruly) as accessarie to a certain conspiracy, perceived
themselves suspected and odious unto him therefore. For, even immediately, by
sequestring them a part into a secret place he brought upon them great hatred,
protesting with his sword drawn, That die he would upon his own hand, if they
also thought him worthy of death. Neither ceased he from that time forward to
accuse one unto the other, and to set them all together by the ears. Now when
these Conspiratours were resolved and agreed to assail him during the Palatine
( a) games, as he departed thence out of the Theater at noonetide, CASSIUS
CHEREA Tribune of the Pretorian Cohort took upon him to play the first part in
this Action: even he, whom being now far stepped in years (...),
CAIUS was wont to frump and flout in most opprobrious terms as a wanton and
effeminate person: and one while, when he came unto him for a watchword, to
give him PRIAPUS or VENUS; another while, if upon any occasion he rendered
thanks, to reach out unto him his hand, not only fashioned but wagging also
after an obscoene and filthy manner.

Many prodigious signs were seen, presaging his future death and murder. 57
The image of JUPITER at Olympia, which his pleasure was to be disiointed and
translated to Rome, did set up all on a sudden such a mighty laughter that
the workmen about it, let their Engines and Vices slip and so ran all away.
And straight-waies came there one in place whose name also was CASSIUS, that
avouched, he had warning and commandment in a dream to sacrifice a Bull unto
JUPITER. The ( a) Capitol in Capua upon the Ides of March was smitten with
lightning. Likewise at Rome the Porters lodge belonging to the Princes Palace.
And there wanted not some who gave their conjecture, that by the one Prodigy
was portended danger to the Master of the house from his Guard and the Squires
of his person; by the other some notable murder again, such as in times past
had been committed upon ( b) the same day. Also, SULLA the Astrologer, when
CAIUS asked his counsel and opinion, as touching the Horoscope of his
Nativitie, told him plain, That most certain and inevitable death approached
near at hand. Semblably the Oracle at Antium, gave him a caveat, to beware of
CASSIUS. For which very cause, he had taken order and given express
commandment, That CASSIUS LONGINUS Proconsull then in Asia, should be
killed: not remembering that the fore-saide CHAEREA had to name CASSIUS. The day
before he lost his life, he dreamt that he stood in heaven close unto the
throne of JUPITER: and that JUPITER spurned him with the great toe of his right
foot, and therewith threw him down headlong to the earth. There went also for
current prodigies and fore tokens of his fall; even those occurrents that
happened unto him that very day, a little before he was murdered. As himself
sacrificed, bespreinct he was with the blood of the foul Phaenicopterus. And

that means flowed with blood. Prepared there was likewise against night

Spirits there, were to be exhibited and unfolded by Egyptians and Aethiopians.

cloisture through which he was to pass certain boys of noble birth sent
for out of Asia (to sing Himnes, and to skirmish martially upon the Stage) were
preparing themselves, he stood still and stayed there to view and encourage
them. And but that the leader and chiefetaine of that crew, said, He was very
cold, he would have returned and presently exhibited that show. But what
befell after this, is reported two manner of ways. Some say, that as he spoke
unto the said boys, CHAER^A came behind his back, and with a drawing blow
grievously wounded his neck with the edge of his sword, giving him these words
before, Hoc age. i. Mind this: Whereupon, CORNELIUS SABINUS, another of the
Conspiratours, encountered him a-front, and ran him through in the breast.
Others write, that SABINUS, after the multitude about him was voided by the
Centurions (who were privy to the Conspiracy) called for a watchword, as the
manner is of soldiers, and when CAIUS gave him the word, JUPITER, CHAEREA cried
out alowde, Accipe ratum. i. Here take it sure: and with that, as he looked
behind him, with one slash cut his chaw quite thorough: Also as he lay on the
ground and drawing up his limbs together cried still, That he was yet alive,
the rest of their accomplices with thirty wounds dispatched and made an end of
him. For, this mot, Repete. i. Strike again, was the signal of them all. Some
of them also thrust their swords through his privy members. At the very first
noise and outcrie, his licter-bearers came running to help, with their litter
staves: Soon after, the Germans that were the squires of his body came in:
and as they slew some of the murderers, so they killed certain Senators also
that were mere innocent.

He lived 29. years, and ruled the Empire three years 10. months and 8. 59
days. His dead corpse was conveyed secretly into the Lamian hortyards, where
being scorched only, or half burnt in a tumultuary and hasty funeral fire,
covered it was with a few turfs of earth lightly cast over it; but afterward,
by his sisters now returned out of exile, taken up, burnt to ashes and
enterred. It is for certain known and reputed; that before this Complement was
performed, the keepers of those hortyards were troubled with the walking of

house wherein he was murdered there passed not a night without some terror or
fearful object, until the uery house it self was consumed with fire. There
dyed together with him, both his Wife CAESONIA, stabbed with a sword by a
Centurion, and also a daughter of his, whose brains were dashed out against a
wall. 60


What the condition and state was of those days, any man may gather, even by
these particulars. For neither, when this massacre was divulged and made known
abroad, men gave credit by and by thereto; but there went a suspicion, that
CAIUS himself had feigned and given out a rumor of this murder, by that
means to sound men's minds, and find, how they stood affected unto him: (...)

chaced the General of the Germans all over the field: neither dissembled he,
but gave it out, that one day he would restore unto the Commonwealth their
ancient state and liberty again. Whereupon, I suppose, some presume to write,
that AUGUSTUS had him in jelousie and suspicion: called him home out of his
Province: and because he lingered and delayed his return, made him aw^y by
poison. Which uerily put down I have, because I would not seem to pretermit
such a matter, rather, than for that I think it either true or probable:
considering that AUGUSTUS both loved him whiles he was alive so entirely, as
that he always ordained him fellow-heire with his sons, (like as he openly
professed upon a time in the Senate house) and also commended him after his
death so highly, that in a solemn oration before the body of the people he
prayed unto the gods. Tououchsafe his own CAESAR'S to be like unto him: and to
grant himself one day such an end as they had given him. And not contented
with this that he had engraven upon his tomb an Epitaph in verse which he
himself composed, he wrote also the history of his life in prose. By ANTONIA
the younger, he became father uerily of many children, but three only he left
behind him at his death, namely, GERMANICUS, LIVILLA, and CLAUDIUS.

This CLAUDIUS was borne at Lions, in the year when JULIUS 2 A. V. C. 744*
ANTONIUS and FABIUS AFRICANUS were Consuls, upon the Calends of August, that
uery day on which the altar was first dedicated there unto AUGUSTUS: and named
he was TIBERIUS CLAUDIUS DRUSUS: and a while after, when his elder brother was

day after that he came to full years and had sued out his live^ie, he was at

every light cause and occasion whatsoever. By reason of this his sickness,
both at the sword-play which he and his brother jointly exhibited in memorial
of their Father, he sat as president (not after the accustomed manner) lapt in
a cloak; and also upon his commensement day, when he was to put on his virile
gown, about midnight without any honorable attendance and solemn train,
brought he was in a licter into the ( a) Capitol.

3 Howbeit, from his very childhood, he employed no mean study in the
liberal sciences. And oftentimes gave good proof even in public place of his
proceedings in them all: yet could he never for all that reach to any degree of
dignity, or yield better hope of himself for the time to come. His mother

AUGUSTA thought always most basely of him, as who used neither to speak unto
him but very seldom, nor to admonish him, unless it were in some sharp and
short writing, or else by messengers going between. His sister LIUILLA, when she
heard that he should be one day Emperor, openly and with a loud * His Grand

the Ornaments of Consuls. But when he instantly demanded still, not imaginary
but true magistracies indeed, he wrote back unto him in his writing tables
thus much only, That he had sent unto him Every one worth 15, ^. 7, ^ ob, or

forty pieces of gold to spend at the feast Saturnalia, and to bestow in
puppets and trifling gaudes, at the same time. Then, and not before, casting
aside all hope of preferment and real dignities, he betook himself to rest
and quietness of life, lying close, one while within hortyardes of pleasure
and in a manner house without the City: and lurking other whiles in a
withdrawing place out of the way in Campania: And by his daily acquaintance and
company keeping with most base and abject persons besides the old infamovs
note of sluggardie and foolishness he incurred an ill name for drunkenness
and dice-play: notwithstanding, that all the while he thus led his life, he
never wanted the public attendance and reverent regard of men seeking unto him.

be admitted extraordinarily: and soon after, That his house, which by

lay upon his deathbed, he both named him among his heirs in a third raunge,

millions of Sesterces: yea recommended him besides by name unto the armies, to
the Senate likewise and people of Rome in the rank of other his especial

entrance into the Forum with his knitches of rods, that an Eagle soaring
thereby, settled upon his right shoulder. He was pricked also and allotted unto
a second Consulship, against the 4. th year following. Diverse times he sat as

8 Yet lived he nevertheless subject to the contumelious reproaches of the
World: For if at any time, he came somewhat with the latest and after the
hour appointed to a supper, hardly and with much ado, was there any room
made for to receive him, and not before he had gone round about the tables
where guests were set, for to find a place: Likewise, whenever he took a

the clappe of a ferula or lash of some whip. They were wont likewise to glove
his hands (as he lay snorting a sleep) with * his shoes, that as he suddenly
awaked he might rub his face and eyes therewith.

house informed ought against him, he was continually and sundry manner of
ways molested. But when as the Conspiracy of LEPIDUS and G^TULICUS came to
light, being sent among other Ambassadors to congratulate CAIUS in the name of
the City, he was in ieopardy of his very life: whiles CAIUS chafed and fumed
with great indignation, that his Uncle chiefly of all others was sent unto him,
as it were to govern a child: In so much, as some have no^ stuck to report on
writing, that he was turned also headlong into the river in his clothes and
all as he came apparailed. From which time forward, never spoke he to any
matter proposed in the Senate, but last of all those, that had been Consuls,
as being in reproachful wise and to his disgrace asked his opinion after them
all. There was received likewise against him the examination of a forged will,
wherein himself also had been a witness and put-to his seal. Last of all,
he was forced to disburse eight millions of Sesterces for a fine or Income at
his entrance into a new Priesthood: by occ^sion whereof, his estate being so
much decayed, driven he was to those streights, that for his disability to
keep credit and satisfy the debt due unto the Chamber of the City by an ( a)

and goods were forfeited and so were published in table as void^ and vacant,
hung up to be sold in vacuum.

10 Having passed the greatest part of his time in running thorough these and
such like troubles, at length in the fiftieth year of age, he attained to the
Empire, and that by a strange and wonderful hap. Being among others excluded
by the Conspiratours that laid wait for CAIUS life, what time they voided all
the Company about his person, under a color as if he desired to be a part
himself alone in some by-place, this CLAUDIUS had stepped a side and retired
into a lodging or parlour called Hermeum: And not long after, being affrighted
at the rumor of that murder slily crept forth and conveied himself up into *
A garret*
a Solar next adjoining, and there hid himself between the hangings that hung
before the door. Whiles he lurked close there, a common Soldier chauncing to
run too and fro that way, espied his feet, and by earnest inquiry and
asking who he was? happened to take knowledge of him: who having drawn him forth
of the place (when as for fear he fell down humbly at his A, V, C. 794
feet and took hold of his knees) saluted him by the name of Emperor. From
thence he brought him immediately to his other fellow Soldiers, who as yet
stood wavering and wist not what to do but fare and fume. By them was he
bestowed in a Licter* and for that his own servants were fled scattering here
and there they also by turns one after another supported the said Licter upon
their shoulders: and so was he brought into the ( Praetorian) Camp, all sad and
amazed for fear: pitied also by the multitude that met him on the way; as if
some innocent had been haled to execution. Being received within the trench and
rampire, lodged he was alnight among the souldiours-watch with less hope of
his a good deal than confidence. For the Consuls together with the Senate and
the cohorts of the citie-souldiers, seized the Foru^ and the Capitol, with a
purpose to claim and recover the common liberty: and when himself was sent
for, by a tribune of the commons into the Curia to sit in consultation and give
his advise about those matters that were thought good to be propounded he made
answer; That detained he was perf^rce and by constraint. But the next morrow,
when as the Senate grew more cold and slack in following and executing their

1500 Sesterces a piece: the first of all the CAESAR'S, that obliged unto him
the Soldiers fealty by a fee and reward.

Having once established his Empire, he thought nothing more dear and 11
behovefull than to abolish the remembrance of those two days, wherein there
was some doubtful question about the change and alteration of the State. Of
all deeds and words therefore, which had passed during that time he made an
Act there should be a general pardon and perpetual oblivion: which also he
made good and performed accordingly. Only, some few Colonels and Centurions,
out of that crew which conspired against CAIUS, he put to the sword: as well
for example sake, as for that he had certain intelligence, they required to
have him also murdered. Then presently turning and bending his mind to the
duties of piety and kindness, he took up no form of oath, either with more
devout religion or oftener, than by the name of AUGUSTUS. He gave order, that
for his Grandmother LIVIA, there should by Decree be granted Divine honors;
as also in the stately pomp of the Cirque Solemnities, a Chariot drawn with
Elephants, like unto that of AUGUSTUS: Semblably, for the souls of his own
parents departed, public Dirges and Funeral feasts: and more than so,
particularly in the honor of his father Cirque-Plaies and games every year
upon his birth day: and in memorial of his mother, a coach to be led and
drawn along through the Cirque: and the surname of AUGUSTA, which by his
Grandmother was refused. In remembrance of his Germanicus.
brother (to celebrate whose memorial he omitted no occasion) he exhibited a
Greek Comaedie at the solemn Games held in Naples: Where by sentence of the
Vmpiers and Judges he received a coronet therefore. He suffered not so much as
M. ANTONIUS to pass unhonoured, nor without a thankful mention and
remembrance: protesting one time, and that by an Edict, That so much the more
earnest he was, to have men celebrate the Birth day of his father DRUSUS,
because upon the same day, his Grandfather ANTONIUS also was borne. The Marble

abrogated and repealed all the Acts of CAIUS, yet the day of his death,
although it were the beginning of his Empire, he forbad to be registered among
feasts in the Calendar.

But in honoring himself he was sparie, and carried a civil modesty. The 12
fore name of Emperor he forbear: excessive honors he refused: the Or
solemnity of nuptial contract.
Espousals of his own daughter, the birthday also of his Nephew her son, he
passed over in silence, only celebrating it with some private ceremony and
religious complements within house. He restored no banished person, but by the
authority and warrant of the Senate. That he might bring with him into the
Curia, the Captain of the Guard and Colonels.
Tribunes of the Soldiers: Item, that those Acts might be ra^ified and
stand in force, which his Procuratours had set down in judging of causes, he
obtained by entreaty. He made suite unto the Consuls for a license, to hold
Faires and Markets, for his own private Manors and Lands. In Commissions and
Examinations of causes held by the Magistrates, he would oftentimes be
personally present and sit as one of the Commissioners. To the same
Magistrates, when they exhibited any Plays or Games, himself also with the
rest of the multitude would arise up, and both with By appla^se and acclamation.
hand and * voice do them honor. When the Tribunes of the Commons repaired
unto him before the Front of his Tribunal, he excused himself unto them, for
that by reason of straight room he could not give audience unto them
otherwise than standing upon their feet. Therefore, within a small time he
purchased so much love and favor, as that when news came (to Rome) that
forlaied and slain he was in his journey to Ostia, the people in a great
tumult and uprore, fell to banning and cursing both the Soldiers as
Traitors, and the Senate also as Paricides: neither ceased they thus to force
against them, until first one messenger, and then another, yea and soon after
many more were produced by the Magistrates to the public ROSTRA, who assured
them that he was alive and approached homeward.

alter the State, GALLUS ASINIUS and STATILIUS CORVINUS, the Nephews of POLLIO
and MESSALLA the Orators, taking unto them for their Accomplices many of his
own freed-men and servants. As for civil war, kindled it was and begun by
FURIUS CAMILLUS SCRIBONIANUS, Lieutenant general of Dalmatia: but within five
days quenched clean and suppressed; by reason that the Legions, which had
changed their oath of allegiance, in remorce of conscience and touch of
religion repented; after that upon signification given of a journey to their
new General, neither the Ominous and unlucky signe^.
Aeagles could be dight and trimmed, nor the military ensigns plucked up and
removed.

14 To his first Consulship he bare four more: of which, the two former
jointly A: V: C: 794 795 800 804
and immediately one after another: the rest ensuing, with some time between,
to wit, each one in the fourth year: and as for the third, he had no
precedent for it in any other Prince, as being substituted in the void place
of a Consul deceased. A precise Iusticer he was, ministering Justice, both when
he was Consul, and also being out of that Office, most painfully; even upon
the solemn days instituted for him and his: yea, and otherwhiles upon the
ancient festival days and such as were religious. He followed not always
the prescript rule of laws, moderating either the rigor or the lenity of
penalties, by equity and reason, according as he stood affected to a cause:

15 Moreover, in the examination, trial, and deciding of controversies, he was
wondrous variable: one while circumspect, wary, and of great insight:
otherwhiles as rash and inconsiderate* now and then also foolish, vain, and
like to one without all reason. When he reviewed upon a time the Decuries of
Judges, and put whom he thought good from their Jurisdiction: one of them, who
had answered to his name, and concealed the immunity and privilege that he had
by the benefit of children, he discharged quite, as a man desirous And
therefore, ambitious.
to be a Judge. Another of them being molested and called into question by his
adversaries before him, as touching a matter between him and them, and
pleading withal for himself, That it was a case to be tried not
extraordinarily (by CAESAR) but by the common course of Law, and in an ordinary
Court of deputed Judges: he compelled immediately to handle and decide his own
cause before him: as who in his proper business should give proof how
indifferent a Judge he would be hereafter in the matter of another. There was
a woman that would not acknowledge her own son. Now, when by evidence unnd

Most ready he was to give judgment on their side, who made appearance in Court
when their adversaries were absent: without any respect and consideration,
whether a man slacked and stayed by his own default, or upon some necessity?
One cried out upon a forger of writings, and required, That both his hands
might be cut off. He made no more a do, but forthwith called instantly, to
have the hangman sent for, with his chopping knife and butchers block, to do
the deed. There happened one to be called iudicially to the bar, For that being
a forainer he bare himself as a Roman Citizen: and when the advocates of
both sides grew to some little variance about this circumstance, namely,

cloak? he then, as if he would make exceeding show of pure and incorrupt
equity, commanded him to shift and change his habit often in the place,
according as he was either accused or defended. Moreover, sitting in judgment
to decide a certain controversy, When he had heard what could be said, he
pronounced sentence out of a written table, as it is verily thought; to this
effect, That he judged on their side, who had alleged the truth. For which
prankes he became base and contemptible, in so much as every where, and openly
he was despised. One, to excuse a Or deponent

had called for out of a Province, alleged in his behalf, and said, He
could not possibly come in time and be present, dissimuling the cause thereof a
great while: at length, after many long demands, what the reason might be?
Why, quoth he, the man is dead at PVTEOLI. Another when he gave him thanks,
for suffering a person accused to have the benefit of a trial and to be
defended, added more-over these words, And yet this is an usual and ordinary
thing. Furthermore, I my self have heard old folk say, That these Lawyers
and Barristers were wont to abuse his patience so much, that as he was going
down from the Or judgment seat.

earnest altercation to let fall these words, (...), i. Thou art both old, and a
fool besides. And verily it is for certain known, that a Gentleman of Rome,

heard against him, flung his writing steel and the books which he had in his
hand, with great ubraiding of him also for his foolishness and cruelty, even
at his very face, so as he rippled and hurt there with his cheek not a little.

He bare also the Censureship: an office that a long time had been
discontinued, 16
A, V, C, 800 801.
after PAULUS and PLANCUS the Censours: but even this very place he held with
an uneven hand and as variable a mind, as the event and success ensuing. In
the review taken of Roman Gentlemen, he dismissed without shame and
disgrace, a young man charged with many infamous villainies, howbeit one whom
his own father testified upon his knowledge and trial to be right honest:
saying withal, That he had a Censor of his own. To another youth, who was in
a very bad name for spoiling of maidens, and adulteries committed with wives,
he did no more but give warning, Either more sparily to spena him self in
those young and tender years of his, or else more warily at leastwise, to go
to work* adding thus much beside. For why know I, quoth he, what wench thou
keep? And when upon the entreaty of his familiar friends he had taken of the
infamous note which was set upon the name of one, Well, quoth he, let the blot

yet remain still to be seen. An honorable man and a principal personage of
the Province Greece, howbeit ignorant in the Latin tongue, he not only rased
out of the rank and roll of Judges, but also deprived of his freedom in Rome,
and made him a mere alien. Neither suffered he any man to render an account of
his life, otherwise than with his own mouth, as well as every one was able,
and without a patron to speak for him. He noted many with disgrace, and some
of them without their knowledge, as mistrusting no such thing* yea, and for a
matter that had no precedent, namely, because without his privity and a pasport
obtained they went forth of Italy: one also among the rest, for that in the
Province he accompanied a King in his train: alleging for example, That in
his Ancestors days RABIRIUS POSTUMUS for following of K. PTOLOMAEUS into
Alexandria to save and recover the money which he had lent him, was accused
before the Judges, of Treason to the State. Having assaied to put many more to

there was, who being accused to have laid violent hands upon himself, and
wounded his own body with a sword, stripped himself naked, and showed the same
whole and sound, without any harm in the world. Many other Acts he did of
special note whiles he was Censour as namely these; He commanded a silver
Chariot sumptuously wrought and set out to sale in the street Sigillaria, for
to be bought and broken all to pieces openly. Item, in one day he published 20
Edicts or Proclamations* and ij among the rest: In the one whereof he gave the
people warning, That when their Vineyards bare Grapes plentifully, they should

That there was nothing so good against the stinging of a Viper, as the juice of

One expedition and no more he undertook, and that was very small. When the
Senate had by Decree allowed him Triumphall ornaments, he 17

Prince and Emperor, willing also to enterprise some exploit, whereby he might
win the due glory of a complet triumph, made choice before all other Provinces

that time in a tumultuous uprore, for that certain revolts and rebels fled

devotion. So, in the sixth month after his first setting forth he returned to
Rome, and triumphed with most sumpteous pomp therefore prepared. To the sight
of which Solemnity, he suffered not only the Presidents and Governors of
Provinces to have recourse into the City, but also certain banished persons.
And among the enemies Spoils, he set up a navall Coronet, and fastened it to

time, the Aemilian Aedifices (or Tenements) were on fire and continued still
burning, he remained two nights together in the place called Diribitorium: and
when the multitude of Soldiers and household servants failed, he called
together by means of the Magistrates, the Commons of the City out of all the
streets and Parishes to come in and help, setting before him his chests full
of money: exhorting them to do their best for the quenching of the fire: and
ready for to pay presently every one a good reward according to the pains he
took. Now, when corn and victuals were grown very scarce, (such was the
continual unseasonable weather that brought barrainnesse) he was upon a time

market place detained by the multitude and so assailed and pelled what with
reviling taunts and what with pieces of broken bread, that hardly and with much
ado he was able to escape, and no otherwise than by a posterne gate, unto the
Palace. Whereupon he devised all the means he possibly could to bring into the
City provision of corn and victuals, even in the winter season. For, he not
only proposed certain set gains to all cornemasters, that would venture for
grain, undertaking himself to bear all the loss that should happen unto
any of them by tempest: but ordained also great fees and availes for those
that would build ships for such traffic and merchandise, according to the
condition and quality of each one. Namely for every Roman Citizen exemption

well as of glory: when some there were, who would have bound themselves in
covenant and promise, to draine the said marrish at their own private charges,
in case the grounds being once made dry might be granted unto them in
freehold. Now, for the length of three miles, partly by digging through the
hill, and partly by hewing out the rock before him, he finished the channel
at last with much ado and after eleven years labor: albeit thirty thousand
men were at work continually about it and never rested between. The Pere at
Ostia beforesayd he made, by drawing an arm of the sea about, on the left and
right hand both: and with all, at the mouth and entrance thereof, where now the
ground lay deep, raising an huge dam or pile against it. For the surer
foundation of which pile, he drowned before hand that ship, wherein the great
Obelisk had been transported out of Egypt: and when he had supported it with
buttresses of many stones, he planted a lo^t upon the same an exceeding high
watch-towre to the pattern of that PHARUS at Alexandria, to the end that by
the fires burning there, in the night season, vessels at sea might direct their

21 He dealt often among the people great doles and Congiaries. Many shows
and games likewise he exhibited, and those magnificent: not such only as were
usual and in accustomed places: but those that were, both newly devised and
also brought into ure again, whereas they had of ancient time been
discontinued: yea and where no man else before him had ever set forth any. The

and give applause, but sat still and kept silence. He set out also the Which

own histories writes;, That whereas the said solemnities had been
intermitted, AUGUSTUS long after by a most exact calculation of the years
reduced them into order again. By occasion whereof, The voice of the crier was
then ridiculous and laughed at, when after the solemn manner he called the
people, To behold those games and plays, which no man had once seen already,

courses he brought in the baiting of wild beasts. But in the greatest Cirque
of ad which was beautified with barr-gates of marble stone and goales all
gilded (whereas before time they had been made of soft sand-stone and wood,)
he appointed proper and peculiar places for the Senators, who had wont before
time to behold the same sports here and there. Beside the races for the prise
of Chariots drawn with four steeds. He represented also the warlike Troie
pastime, and the baiting of Leopards: which the troup of the Pretorian horse
men slew, having for their leaders the Tribunes and the Captain himself.
Moreover, he brought into the shewplace Thessalian men of arms, whose manner
is to chase about the cirque, wild bulls; until they be tired: then to mount
them, and by the horns to force them down to the ground. As for shows of
swordfensers, he exhibited them in many places, and after diverse and sundry
sorts. One, that was kept every year within the Praetorian camp, without any
b^ting and sumptuons provision of furniture. As for that, which was ordin^ set
out and formally with baiting and other preparations in mars field at^ Septa:

which he began to call Sportula, because he proclaimed at first when he
exhibited it, That he invited the people there to, as it were to a sudden
supper and short pittance, such as men use to bid themselves unto. And in no
kind of sport or gaming represented unto them, was he more civil, familiar and
better disposed to pass the time away: in so much as putting forth his left
hand, he together with the common sort, would both by word of mouth tell, and

and in season delivered: when he had by a special indulgence, granted unto a
Champion who fought out of a British chariot, (for whom his four children
made earnest suite and entreaty) That he should be freed from that profession
of swordfight; and that with the great favor and liking of all men, he sent
presently an admonition in writing: wherein he advertised the people, How much
they should endeavor to get children, seeing, as they did, in what good st^ed
they served, and how they procured grace even unto a very sword-fenser. He
represented also in Mars field a warlike show of the winning and sacking of a
town: Likewise the yielding of the Princes of Britain; where he sat himself
as president in his rich Coat Armor. When he was about to let out the water of

civil and military affairs, as also concerning all degrees of persons both
at home and abroad* he either reformed, or after long disuse forgotten, brought
into practice again, or else instituted and ordained new. In the election and
admission of Priests throughout their several Colleges, he nominated not one
but he took his oath first. He observed also precisely that so often as there
was an Earthquake in the City, the Pretour for the time being should call a
public assembly, of the people and proclaim certain holydaies: Semblably,

and removed the base multitude of mechanical laborers and slaves.

23 The handling of causes and judicial pleading in Courts, divided before
time into certain months for winter and summer, he conjoined altogether. The
jurisdiction as touching feofments upon trust which was wont year by year,
and only within the City to be committed unto the magistrates, he ordained
to hold by patent for ever: and betook the charge thereof unto the rulers and
governors also of state in every province. That That a Woman under 50, years

themselves were manumised and enfranchised, but such also, as were free borne
of their progeny. The College of Questours, insteede of pauing the streets and

between, the Pretours for the time being, or those verily who had been
Pretours before had borne. Unto SILANUS espoused and betrothed unto his
daughter, before he was undergrowen and 14. years of age he granted
triumphall ornaments: but of elder persons to so many, as there is an Epistle
extant written in the common name of the Legions wherein they make petition,
That unto the Consuls Lieuetenants there might be granted together with the
conduct of the army, the said triumphall honors: to the end that they should
pick quarrels and seek occasions of war, they cared not how nor what way?
Moreover to A. PLANTIUS he gave by a decree the pety triumph Ovatio: and as he
entered so into the City himself met him upon the way: and both when he went

25 The horsemens service and their places he ordered so by degrees, as that
after the charge of a cohort, he granted the leading of a wing: and after the
command thereof, the Tribuneship or regiment of a Legion: he ordained their
stipends also: and a kind of imaginary warrefare called Supra-Numerum (which
they that were absent might execute) and in name or title only. By virtue of a
decree that passed even from the Nobles them selves, he prohibited all
soldiers professed, to enter into any Senators houses for to do their duty
and salute them. Those Libertines who bare them selves for Roman gentlemen he
caused to forfeit their goods and bodies to the state. Such of them as were
unthankeful and of whom their patrons complained, he deprived of freedom and
made them bound again: Yea and denied unto their advocates for to hear any
plea and to sit in judgment against their own freed men. When some Masters
there were, that put forth their sick and diseased slaves into the Isle of*

chose to kill them outright, rather then thus to put them forth, they should be
guilty of murder. He gave warning by an edict, that no waifaring men should
travail through any town in Italy, but either on foot or ( a) borne in a
chair, or else carried in a licter. In Puteoli and in Oslia he placed several
cohorts, to put by all mischances of skare-fires. He forbad all persons by

him self, he yielded up again into the hands and dispose of the Senate. The
Lycians he deprived of their freedom, by occasion of the mortal discord and
variance among them. To the Rhodians, who repented for their old trespasses
he restored their liberty which they had lost. He forgave all tribvtes to
the Ilienses for ever, as to the first founders and stocke-fathers of the
Roman Nation: And to that purpose he red an old letter in Greek written
unto K. SELEUCUS by the Senate and people of ROME: wherein they, promised to
entertain amity and league with him upon this condition, that he would
grant unto the Ilienses, their natural kinsfolk, immunitie from all taxes
and tributes. This some think is to be understood of Christians who^ we find
in the Ecclesiastical writers to be misnamed by the Ethnicke Infides^,
Chr^sti an^, like as Christ himself Christ^, in ^korne.
The ( b) Jews who by the instigation of one CHRESTUS were evermore
tumultuous, he banished ROME. The Ambassadors of the GERMANS he permitted to
sit in the ( c) Orchestra (with the Senators) being moved so to do at their
simplicity and confident boldness for that being brought into the ( d)
Popularia and perceiving PARTHIANS and ARMENIANS sitting among the Senators,
they of their own accord had remooved and passed to that quarter: giving out
these words withal, that their valor and condition of estate was nothing
inferior to the others, The religion of the Dr^idae among the Frenchmen,
practicing horrible and detestable cruelty and which under AUGUSTUS, Roman
Citizens only were forbidden to profess and use, he quite put down and
abolished. Contrariwise, the sacred rites and holy Caeremonies (of CERES)
called Eleusima, he attempted to transfer out of the Territory Attica to
ROME. The Temple likewise of VENUS ( e) Erycine in Sicilie, which in
continuance of time was decayed and fallen down, he caused to be repavred
and built again at the common charges of the people of ROME: He made

Heralds in old time pronounced: But both these affairs and others besides,
the whole Empire also in a manner or a great part thereof he managed not so
much after his own mind, as by the direction and will of his Wives and
children: being verily affected and framed for the most part so, as stood
either with their profit or good pleasure.

26 When he was a very youth, he had espoused two maidens, namely AEMILIA
LEPIDA neice to AUGUSTUS once remooved, likewise LIVIA MEDULLINA, surnamed also
CAMILLA, a Lady descended sro^ the ancient house of Camillus the Dictatour.
The former of these twain, because her parents had offended AUGUSTUS he cast
off remaining as yet a Virgin: the latter, he lost by occasion of sickness,
upon that very day which was appointed for the marriage. After this, he wedded
these wives, to wit, PLAUTIA O^ Vrg^lanilla.
HERCULANILLA, whose father had triumphed; and not long after, AELIA PAETINA,
whose father had been Consul. Both these he divorsed. PAETINA upon light
offenses and small displeasures: mary, HERCULANILLA he put away for her filthy
lust and whorish life; as also for suspicion of a murder. After these he took
to wife VALERIA MESSALLINA, the daughter of BAREATUS A, V, C, 801 ^

Auspices, he put to death. And in a speech that he made openly before his
Pretorian Soldiers, avowed that because his marriages proved so bad, he
resolved to remain unmarried and live a single life: and if he did not
continue so for ever, he would not refuse to be stabbed by their very hands.
Neither could he endure, but forthwith treat upon conditions of marriage even
with PAETINA, whom long before he had put away: yea and with LOLLIA PAVLINA
wife some time to C. CAESAR. But through the enticing allurements of AGRIPPINA,
the * His own ^cipce
daughter of GERMANICUS his own brother what by the means of kissing
courtesies, what by the opportunities of other daliances, being drawn into
love and fancy with her, at the next Session of Senate he subborned certain
of purpose to opine and give advise, To compel him for to make her his Wife;
as being a matter of right great consequence, and which most of all concerned
the State: That other men also might be dispensed with and licenced to contract
the like With their brothers or sisters daughters
marriages which until that time were reputed incestuous. And so, himself
stayed hardly one day between, before he dispatched the wedding: but none were
found that followed the precedent, except one libertine and another who had
been a principal Centurion in the foremost Cohort, at whose marriage even himself
in person together with AGRIPPINA was present to do him credit and honor.

27 Children he begat of 3. wives. By HERCVLANILLA he had DRUSUS and CLAUDIA:
By PAETINA he was father of ANTONIA: and MESSALLINA bare unto him OCTAVIA and a
son, whom first he named GERMANICUS and afterward BRITANNICUS. As for DRUSUS,
he lost him at Pompeijs impubere^ amisit.
Pompeij, before he was 14. years of age by occasion that he was choked with
a pear which in play and pastime being tossed aloft into the air, fell just
into his mouth as he gaped wide for it: unto whom also but few days before,
he had affianced in marriage the daughter of SEIANUS: which makes me more to
mervaile that some have written, he was treacherously killed by SEIANUS, His
(supposed) daughter CLAUDIA, who in deed was conceived by his freed man BOTER,
although she was borne before the fifth month after the divorce, A* V* C: 773

unto SILANUS. His son BRITANNICUS, whom MESSALLINA bare A: V: C* 806
unto him the twentieth day after he came to the Empire and in his second
Consulship, being yet a very babe he recommended continually both to the
Soldiers in open assembly, dandling him in his own hands, and also to the
common people at the solemnities of games and plays, holding him either in his
bosom or just before him, whiles the multitude with great acclamations, all
good words and fortunate osses seconded him. Of his sons in Law who matched
A: V* C: 103
with his daughters, he adopted NERO: POMPEIUS and SILANUS he not only cast
off and rejected but murdered also.

28 Of all his freed men he esteemed especially POSIDES the Or gelded man:
Eunuch, unto whom also in his triumph over Britain, among martial men and
valiant Soldiers, he gave a spear H^sta pura d^ navit* For his great valor
forsooth:
without an iron head: and no less account made he of Of this Faeli^ mention
is made in the Acts of the Apostles:
FAELIX: whom first he ordained Captain over the Cohorts and Cornets of
Horsemen, yea and ruler of the Province Jury; the husband ( a) of three
Queens. As also of HARPOCRAS, unto whom he granted a privilege to be carried
in a Litter through the City of Rome, and to set out ( b) Games and Plays in
public: And besides these, he affected with much respect POLY^IUS the guide
and directour to him in his Studies, who oftentimes would walk cheek by iole
between the two Consuls. But above all these, he held in greatest esteem,
NARCISSUS his Secretary or enditer of Epistles, and PALLAS the Keeper of his
books of accounts* whom by virtue of a Decree also which went from the Senate,
he suffered willingly to be not only rewarded with rich Fees, but also to be
adorned with the Honors of Questure and Pretureship: likewise to get, to pill
and poll by hook and crook so much, as that when himself complained upon a
time how little treasure he had in his Coffers, one made answer unto him not
absurdly, That he might have store enough and plenty, in case his two

freed men would admit him to share with them.

29 To these (freed men) and to his wives as I said before, being wholly
addicted and enthralled, he bare himself not as an absolute Prince, but as
their ( a) Minister and Servitour. According as it was behoovefull and
commodious to any of these, or stood with their affection and pleasure, he
granted honorable dignities, conferred the conducts of Armies, and awarded
impunities and punishments: yea, and for the most part, I assure you when
himself was altogether ignorant and wist not what he did. And not to reckon
up particularly, every small thing, to wit, his liberalities and gifts revoked,
his judgments reversed, his Patents and Writings concerning the graunts of
Offices either foisted in or plainly altered and changed by them: he slew his
brother ( a) APPIUS SILANUS: the ij IULIE, the one daughter of Consocerum: so

loose his life in the beginning of the year on the very wedding day of
CLAUDIUS and AGRIPPINA. To the execution of 35 Senators, and above an hundred
Roman Gentlemen so easily was he induced, as that, when the Centurion
brought word back, as touching the death of one who had been Consul, saying,
That the deed was done which he had commanded, he flatly denied, that he gave
any such warrant. Nevertheless the thing he allowed: whiles his freed men
aforesaid standing by, avouched, That the Soldiers had done their devoir, in
that they ran willingly of their own heads to revenge their Emperor. For, it
would be thought incredible if I should relate, How even for the very marriage
of MESSALLINA with the Adulterer SILIUS: his own self sealed the Writings for
assurance of the Dowry, being persuaded and brought thereunto, as though the
said wedding was but colourably, of purpose pretended to avert forsooth and
translate the danger, that by certain prodigies were portended to hang over
his own head.

30 Right personable he was, and carried a presence not without authorite and
majesty, whether he stood or sat; but especially when he was laid and took
his repose. For, of stature he was tall, and nathlesse his body not lanke and
slender. His countenance lively, his gray hairs beautiful, which became him
well, with a good fat and round neck under them. Howbeit, both as he went his
hams being feeble failed him: and also whiles he was doing ought, were it re
missely or in earnest, many things disgraced him: to wit, undecent laughter
and unseemely anger, by reason, that he would froth and slaver at the mouth,
and had evermore his nose dropping: Besides, his tongue stutted and stammered:
his head likewise at all times, but especially if he did any thing were it
never so little used to shake and tremble very much.

31 Concerning his bodily health, as before time he used to be grievously sick,
so being once Emperor exceeding healthful he was and stood clear of all
diseases save only the pain of the ( a) stomach* in a fit whereof he said,
he thought to have killed himself.

32 He made feasts, and those very great and ordinarily; yea, and in most open
and large places, such as for the most part would receive six hundred guests
at one sitting. He feasted also even upon the Sluice of the Lake Fucinus: what
time he had like to have been drowned, when as the water let out with a
forcible violence reflowed back again. At every supper his manner was to
have also his own children, who together with other noble men's children as
well boys as girls, should after the old manner sit and feed at the tables

of gold the day before, he reinvited against the morrow: and then he let before

pot to drink in. It is reported moreover, that he meant to set forth an
Edict, wherein he would give folk leave to break wind downward and let it
go ( a) even with a crack at the very bourd; having certain intelligence,
that there was one who for manners and modesty sake, by holding it in,
endaungered his own life.

33 For appetite to meat and drink his stomach served him passing well
always, and in every place. Sitting upon a time iudicially in AUGUSTUS Hall of
Justice, to hear and determine causes, and senting there the steime of a
dinner, that was a dressing and serving up for the Priests ( a) Salij in the
temple of Revenger, Situate near to the Hall: for distinction of another
Temple, bearing that name, in the Capitol mount.
Mars next adjoining, he forsook the Tribunal, went up to the said Priests,
and there sat down with them to meat. Lightly you should never have him go
out of any dining room. but with his belly strutting out, well whitled also
and drenched with wine: so, as straightwaies, whiles he laid him down along
upon his back and took a sleep gaping, there was a feather put ordinarily
into his mouth wide open for to discharge his stomach. He took very short
sleeps: for commonly before midnight he awaked: yet so, as otherwhiles he
would catch a nap in the day time, as he sat to minister justice: and scarcely
could be awakened by the Advocates at the bar, who of purpose raised their
voices and pleaded the louder. He was excessively given to the wanton love of
women. As for the preposterous abuse of malekind, he was altogether
unacquainted therewith. He played at dice most earnestly (concerning the Art
and skill whereof, he published also a little book) being wont to plie that
game even whiles he was carried up and down, having his Carroch and Dice-bourd
so fitted, as there might be no confusion nor shuffling at all in play.

That cruel he was and given to bloodshed naturally, appeared in great and 34
very small matters. As for tortures used in examinations, and the punishments
that ( a) PARICIDES suffered, he exhibited and exacted the same to be done
without delay, and openly in his own presence. Being desirous upon a time to
be hold an execution performed after the ancient manner at Tibur, when as,
(the malefactors standing bound already to a stake), there wanted the
butcherly executioner to do the feat; he stayed there still in the place, and
waited until evening, for one that was sent for out of Rome. At all Sword
fights, whether they were set forth by himself, or by others, he commanded as
many of the Champions as chanced only but to stumble and fall therewith, to
have their throats cut: especially the Fencers called The adverse faction to
the (...) whom he favored
Retiarij; and why! because forsooth he would see their faces as they lay
gasping and yielding up their breath. It fortuned, that a couple of these
fighting at sharp wounded and ^illed one another: Thereupon he commanded
little knives to be mad^ of both their blades, for his own proper use. He
took such pleasure in those that Which combats were usually in the morning:
fought ( b) with wild beasts, as also in the sword fights ordinarily about
noone, that he would by break of day go down to the Theater for to behold the
one: and at noone disinisse the people to their dinners, and sit it out
himself to see the other: yea, and besides those that were appointed to such
combats, upon any slight and sudden occasion set some to fight for their
lives, even out of the number of Carpentars, Servitours, and such like employed
about these games: if happily any of those artificial ( c) motions that go by
vices, or a pageant Or Pegme
in frame, or some such fabric proved not well. He fetched in also one of his
own Prompters of names.
Nomenclatours even in his gown as he went With wild beasts or otherwise.
to fight for his life.

35 But it passed, how timorous and diffident he was. At his first coming to
the Empire; (how ever as we said before, he bragged and stood upon his civil
and familiar behavior) he durst not for certain days go to any feast,
dinner or supper, without Pensionars standing about him with their spears and
Iavelins, and his Soldiers waiting at the table: neither visited he any
sick person, unless the bedchamber where the party lay, were first searched;
the beds, bolsters, pillowes, Coverlets and other clothes were groped, felt,
and thoroughly shaken before hand. All the time after, he appointed evermore
certain searchers for them all, that came to salute him, sparing not one; and
such searchers as were most cruel. For, long it was first, and that with much
ado, ere he granted that women, young boys in their embroidred coats, and
maidens, should not be handled and felt in this manner: that any man's
Attendants likewise or Clerks might not have their Pensheathes and
Penknifecases ( a) taken from them. In a civil commotion, when CAMILLUS,
(making no doubt but that without any war at all he might be terrified)
willed him in a contumelious, menacing, and malapert letter, to resign up the
Empire, and to lead a quiet life in private estate, he called his Nobles and
chief personages about him, to counsel, and put to question, whether it were
best to hearken unto him or no?

36 At the headless report and flying news of some treason that should be
practiced against him, he was so affrighted, that he went about to lay down
his Imperial dignity. By occasion, that one (as I related before) was taken
with a weapon upon him, about his person as he sacrificed, in all have he sent
out the Bedels and called the Senate together; before whom, with tears and
loud outcries he bewailed his own piteous case, as who no where could make
account of any safety: and thereupon for a long time forbear to come abroad.
His affectionate love also to MESSALLINA, most servant though it were he
renounced and cast clean from her, not so much for any indignity of the
dishonorable wrongs she offered unto him, as upon very fear of danger; as
fully persuaded that she practiced to bring the Empire into SILIUS the
Adulterers hands. At which time in a great fright he fled in shameful manner
to the camp, asking and enquiring all the way nothing else, but whether the
Empire remained still safe to his behoof?

37 There arose no suspicion, there came forth no Author so light and vain,
but gave him a bone to gnaw upon, and put no small toys in his head: whereby he
was forced to beware and seek revenge. One of those, that had a matter
depending in Court before him, taking him a side, when he came by way of
salutation to do his duty, avowed unto him, that he dreamed, How he was
killed by one. Then within a while after, the same party, (as if he had now
taken knowledge who that one was that should murder him) pointed unto his own
adversary, even as he tendered a supplication unto CLAUDIUS; and said, This
is he. Whereupon immediately apprehended he was, and haled to execution. After
the semblable manner by report, came APPIUS SILANUS to his death. For, when
MESSALLINA and NARCISSUS had conspired to work his overthrow and final
destruction, they complotted thus, that NARCISSUS betimes in a morning before
day light rushed like a man amazed and astonished into the bedchamber of his
Patron (CLAUDIUS) relating unto him his dream, namely that APPIUS had laid
violent hands upon him: and MESSALLINA for her part, composing and framing her
self as if she wondered greatly thereat, reported, How she likewise had
seen already the same vision for certain nights together. And not long after
this, word came, (as it was before agreed between them) that APPIUS was
coming to rush in among them: * Narcissas.
who in deed had been bidden the day before to be present at the same instant.
Whereupon, as if the said dream had now proved true and been plainly
represented in effect, order was given for APPIUS, to be endited, arraigned,
and to suffer death. Neither doubted CLAUDIUS the morrow after to report the
whole story and the order thereof unto the Senate: and withal to give thanks
unto his (...) atque Iracundi^. The man's is of this Author throughout his

38 Being privy to himself of passionate ( a) anger and bearing malice, he
excused them both in an Edict, distinctly promising that the one of them verily
should be but short and harmless, the other not unjust nor causeless. Having
sharply rebuked the men of Ostia, because they had not sent boats and barges to
meet him as he came upon the river Tiberis: and that in such odious terms as

Some there were, whom in the very open street he thrust from him with his own

Aediles their authority to punish the disorder of those that kept Tavernes and
victualing houses. But as touching his own foolishnes, he concealed it not,
but gave it out and protested in certain short orations, That he counterfaited
himself a fool for the nonce during CAIUS days: because otherwise he should
not have escaped, nor attained to that (imperial) place which he aimed at and
was now entered upon. Howbeit, he could not make the world believe so much,

daughter and nourceling: to give out also, That she was borne and brought up
in his bosom. Having a purpose to admit NERO into the very name of his own
house and family, as if he had not incurred blame enough already for adopting
(him) his wives son, having a natural Brita^icus:
son of his own who was now of ripe years, he eft-soones divulged, That
never any one had been by adoption inserted or incorporate into the family of
the CLAUDII.

He showed oftentimes so great negligence and carelesnes what he said or did, 40
that he was thought not to know nor consider, either who made any speech, or
among whom, or at what time, and in what place? When there was some question
and debate about Butchers and Vintnars, he cried out in the Senate house,
Ibeseech Rogo'vos, o^ I demand of you:
you, my Masters who is able to live without a little piece or morsel of
flesh? and withal described the Or excessive number:
abundance of the old Tavernes ( a), from whence himself also in times past
was wont to be served with wine. As touching a certain Questour, who was a
Candidate of his and by him recommended: among other reasons why he favored
him, he alleged this, Because his Father, quoth he, had quickly and in due
time given him lying sick, cold water to drink. Having in the Senate brought
in a woman to depose, This, quoth he, was my mothers freed woman, and she that
kept her ornaments, and used to de^k and dress her: But she always took me
for her Patron. This have I, quoth he, delivered of purpose, because there be
some yet in mine house, who think me not to be her Patron. Moreover, sitting
upon the Tribunal, when he was in a great chafe, and the men of Ostia
requested at his hands (I wot not what) in the name of their town; he cried
out aloud, That he knew nothing wherefore he should oblige the^ unto him: And
if any man else, quoth he, I also am free and at mine own liberty. As for
these words of his which now I will relate, they were rife in his mouth daily,
yea every hour and minute thereof. What do thou take (b) me for THEOGONIUS
and (...)? beside many such foolish terms, not beseeming private persons, much
less a Prince, otherwise not uneloquent nor unlearned: nay, rather one eagerly
given to his book, and a great Student in the liberal Sciences.

In his youth, he attempted to write an History, exhorted thereto by TITUS 41
LIVIUS; and having the help besides of SULPITIUS FLAVUS. And when he put the
same first to the trial and judgment of men in a frequent auditorie, hardly
and with much a*do he read it through, being often in the while coldly heard,
by an occasion that himself gave. For, when, (as he began his reading) there
was set up a laughter, by reason that many of the seats brake with the weight
of a certain corpulent and fatswad, he was not able to hold, no not after the
^umult appeased, but eftsoons ever and anon call to mind that accident and
fall afresh to unmeasurable laughing. During his Empire likewise, he both
wrote much and also rehearsed the same continually by his reader. The beginning
of his foresaid history he took from the time presently ensuing the murder of
CAESARDICTATOR: but he passed over to the latter days: and began again at
the civil pacification: perceiving that it was not left in his power and
liberty to write of the occurrents in those former times, as who was often
checked both by his Antonia the Triumvirs daughter.
mother and also by his Octavia the wife of Antonia of Livia (...) sta her
seife.
grandame. Of the former argument he left behind him two volumes, of the
later, fortie-one. He compiled of his own life eight books: a report not so
wisely and discreetly put down, as otherwise elegantly penned: Item, an
Apology or defense of CICERO against the books of ASINIUS GALLUS: a piece of
work full enough of learning. He devised moreover three ( a) new characters or
letters in the (Latin) Alphabet, and put them to the number of the old as
most necessary. And having published whiles he was yet a private person,
concerning the reason of those letters, one book: soon after being Emperor
he easily effected that they should be brought into use also indifferently with
the rest. And verily such manner of writing with those characters is now extant
to be seen in many books of records in Iournels, and titles or inscriptions
of works.

42 With no less diligence studied he the Greek disciplines, professing as
any occasion was offered, his affectionate love to that tongue, and the
excellency thereof. When a certain Barbarian discoursed in Greek and Latin,
see you be skillful, quoth he, in both our languages; And in recommending
ACHAIA unto the LL. of the Senate, he said it was a province that he affected
well and delighted in, for the commerce and society of studies common to him
and them: and many a time he answered their ambassadors in the Senate, with a
long and continued oration (in Greek). But upon the Tribunal he used very
much verses also out of HOMER. CERTES whenever he had taken revenge of enemy
or traitor, he lightly gave unto the Tribune over the Sentinels and guard of
his person, calling unto him after the usual manner for a watchword, none
other but this

(...)

Resist, revenge with maine and might.

To conclude, in the end he wrote Greek histories also, to wit twenty books
entitled Of (...) affairs.
Tyrrhenicoon, and 8. entitled Of Carthaginian matter^ Called Claudi^.
Carchedoniacoon. In regard of which histories, unto the ancient school at
Alexandria he adjoined another bearing his own * name: and ordained it was,
that every year in the on of them his books Tyrrhenicoon; and in the other his
Carchedoniacoon upon certain days appointed therefore should (as it were in a
frequent Auditorie) be read whole and through by several single readers in
their turns.

43 Toward the end of his life, he showed certain signs and those evident
enough, that he repented both his marriage with AGRIPPINA, and the adoption also
of NERO. For by occasion that his freed-men made mention and gave their
commendation of a judicial proceeding of his, wherein he had condemned the day
before, a Woman in the case of adultery, he avouched That the destinies
likewise had so ordained, that all his Matrimoni^. or Wives like as Co^gia pre

his son BRITANNICUS and embracing him harder and more closely than his manner

very young and of tender years his ( a) Virile Robe, seeing that his stature
and growth would bear and permit it, he uttered these words moreover, To the
end that the people of Rome may yet at last, have a true and Natural CAESAR.

44 And not long after this he wrote his will and signed it with the seals of
all the ( a) head-magistrates: whereupon before that he could proceed any
further, prevented he was and cut short by AGRIPPINA. Whom they also who were

privy to her and of her council, yet nevertheless enformers, accused
besides all this of many crimes. And verily it is agreed upon generally by all,
that killed he was by poison: but ( a) where it should be, and who gave it,
there is some difference. Some write, that as he sat at a feast in the
(Capitol) Castle with the priests, it was presented unto him by HALOTUS the
Eunuch his taster: others report that it was at a meal in his own house by
AGRIPPINA herself, who had offered unto him a mushrome empoisoned; knowing
that he was most greedy of such meats. Of those accide^ts also which ensued
hereupon, the report is variable. Some say, that straight upon the receipt of
the poison he became speechless, and continuing all night in dolorous
torments, dyed a little before day. Others affirm, that at first he fell a
sleep: and afterward, as the meat flowed and floted aloft vomited all up,
and so was followed again with a rank Toxico,
poison. But whether the same were put into a mess of thick gruell,
(considering he was of necessity to be refreshed with food being emptied in
his stomach) or conveyed up by a clistre, as if being oovercharged with
fullness and surfeit, he might be eased also by this kind of egestion and
purgation, it is uncertain.

45 His death was kept secret until all things were set in order about his
successor. And therefore, both vows were made for him as if he had lain
sick still and also comicall Actours were brought in place colourably to solace
and delight him, as having a longing desire after such sports. He deceased
three days before the Ides of October, when ASINIUS MARCELLUS and ACILIUS
AVIOLA were Consuls: in the 64th year of his age, and 14th of his Empire. His
funerals were performed with a solemn pomp and procession of the Magistrates:
and canonized he was a Saint in Heaven: Which honor forlet and abolished by
NERO he recovered afterward by the means of VESPASIAN.

46 Especial tokens there were presaging and prognosticating his death: to wit

was blasted with lightning: and for that in the same year most of the ( a)
Magistrates of all sorts were dead. But himself seems not either to have
been ignorant that his end drew near, or to have diffimuled so much: which
may be gathered by some good arguments and demonstrations. For both in the
ordination of Consuls he appointed none of them to continue longer then the
month wherein he dyed: and also in the Senate, the very last time that ever he
sat there, after a long and earnest exhortation of his children to concord, he
humbly recommended the age of them both to the LL. of that honorable house:
and in his last Judicial Session upon the Tribunal once or twice he pronounced
openly, That come he was now to the end of his mortality: notwithstanding they
that heard him, greived to hear such an Osse, and prayed the gods to avert the
same.

THE HISTORY OF Nero Claudius Caesar,

CNEUS and LUCIUS: and the same in variety worth the noting and observation:
onewhile continuing either of the saydnames in three persons together:
otherwhiles changing alternatively one after another in every descent. For, we
have heard say, that the first, second and third of these Aenebarbi were
forenamed LUCII: and again, the three next following them in order were CNEI.
All the rest no otherwise then by turns one after another had their forenames,
first LUCII and then CNEI. That many persons of this house descended should be
known, I suppose it very pertinent and material: whereby it may the better
appear, that NERO degenerated from the Virtues of his Ancestors so, as yet he
carried away and resembled the vices of them all, as infused into him and inbred
by nature.

civil war taken prisoner before Corfininum: From whence being dismissed and
set at liberty, after he had by his coming to the Massiltans straightly
beleagured, much strengthened them, suddenly he forsook them: and in the end,
at the battle of, Pharsalia lost his life; A man not very constant and
resolute, but with all of a fell and savage nature. Being driven to utter
despair, he was so much afraid of death, which for fear he had desired, that
after a drawght of poison he repented the taking there of and cast it up
again; yea and enfranchised his Physician, who wittingly and of purpose had so
tempered it that it might do him no great harm. And what time as CN. POMPEIUS

sticked to no part? He alone opined, That they were to be reckoned enemies and

all others of his name and li^age. This man being among those that were privy
to CAESAR'S death, and of that conspiracy, standing condemned (though
guiltless) by the law Which Q. Padius made against the mur derers of Caesar

Neither yielded he it up to M. ANTONIUS before his own side was every where
quite overthrowen: which he then did of his own accord; and so, as that
ANTONIUS took himself highly beholden unto him therefore. He only also of all
those who by virtue of the like law stood condemned, being restored into his
native country, went through the most honorable offices of state: Soon after
likewise, when civil dissension was kindled again and renewed, being in
quality of Lieutenant to the said ANTONIE, what time the sovereign Empire was
offered unto him by those who were ashamed of The present state governed
according to his will and pleasure.
CLEOPATRA, not daring to accept thereof nor yet to refuse it resolutely, by
occasion of sudden sickness wherewith he was surprised, went and sided with
AUGUSTUS, and within few days after departed this life: being himself also
noted with some infamy: For, ANTONIE gave it commonly forth, That for the love

of one SERUILIA Nais whom he kept, he fled to AUGUSTUS side.

4 From him came that DOMITIUS, who soon after had the name abroad to have
been the Dicis causa. i. by an imaginary bargain of sale to have bought them
to the behoof and use of the heir
chapman of AUGUSTUS goods and substance left by his will and testament: a man
no less renowned in his youth for good skill in ruling of Chariots and running
with them a race, as afterward for the triumphant ornaments achieved by the
German war; but arrogant of spirit, wastefull in expense, and therewith
cruel. When he was Aedile he forced L. PLANCUS that had been Censorium, not
Censorem.
Censor, to give him the way. Bearing the honorable offices of Preture and
Consulate, he produced upon the stage to act a Comicall and wanton Interlude,
the gentlemen and dames of Rome. He exhibited baiting of wild beasts both in
the cirque and also in every quarter of the City, yea and a show of
sword-fight: but with so great cruelty, that AUGUSTUS was compelled of
necessity to restrain him by an edict, since that no secret warning nor
admonition at his hands would prevail.

suddenly put his horses to gallop, and not unwittingly rode over a little
child and trod him to death: and also at Rome in the midst of the Forum
plucked a Roman gentleman's eye out of his head, for chiding him somewhat over
boldly. So false and perfidious beside, that he defrauded not only the bankers
and money changers of the prices of such commodities as they had bought up, but
also when he was Pretour put the runners with Chariots besides the prises of
their victories. For which prankes, reproved he was merrily even by his own
sister (LEPIDA) and upon complaint made by the Masters of the four ( a)
factions he enacted, That from thence-forth ever after, the said prises should

fearful events. And even a very word that his father DOMITIUS spoke, was
taken to be a presaging osse. For when his friends by way of gratulation wished
him joy of his son new born: he said, That of himself and AGRIPPINA there
could nothing come into the world but accursed, detestable and to the hurt of
the weal public. Of the same future infortunity there appeared an evident
sign upon his ( a) naming day: For CAIUS CAESAR (CALIGULA) when his sister
(AGRIPPINA) requested him to give the Infant what Forename.
name he would, looking wistly upon CLAUDIUS his Uncle, (by whom afterward
being Emperor (the child) was adopted), said he gave him his name. Neither
spoke he this in earnest, but merrily in board: and AGRIPPINA scorned and
rejected it, for that as then, CLAUDIUS went for a fool, and one of the
laughing stocks of the Court. At three years of age he became fatherless: and
being his fathers heir but of one third part, yet could not he touch so much
as that, full and whole, by reason of CAIUS his coheire who had seized upon and
caught up beforehand all the goods* and for that his mother also was soon
after confined and packt away, he being in manner destitute of all help and
very needy, was fostered in his Aunt LEPIDAES house under two Paedagogues, a
dauncer and a Barber. But when CLAUDIUS was come once to the Empire, he not
only recovered his Fathers goods
patrimony, but also was enriched by the inheritance of CRISPUS PASSIENUS his
mothers husband, that fell unto him. And verily through the grace and power of
his mother now called home again and restored to her estate, he flourisned
and grew so great, that commonly it was bruted abroad, That MESSALLINA the wife
of CLAUDIUS sent some of purpose to take the opportunity of his noones sleep

smuddre and strangle him, as the only Concurrent of BRITANNICUS, and one that
eclipsed the light of his glory. Now in the tale it went, besides* that the
said parties took a fright at a Dragon issuing out of his pillow, whereupon
they fled back and forsook the enterprise. Which fable arose upon this, That
there was in deed found the Or skin
slough of a serpent in his bed about the bo^sters. And yet, this slough he
enclosed within a bracelet of gold (as his mother willed him) and wore it a
good while after, upon his right arm: and at length, weary of any memorial
and monument of his mothers flung it away: but in his extremity and despair
of his estate sought for the same again, in vain.

7 In his tender years, and whiles he was yet a boy of no full growth, he
acted at the Circeian Games the warlike Troy fight most resolutely, with great
favor and applause of the people. In the Vndec^mo: some read rather tertio et

ANNAEUS SENECA, even then a Senator, for to be trained up in good literature.
The report goes, that SENECA, the next night following, dreamed as he lay in
bed, That he was teaching Caligula.
C. CAESAR: and shortly after NERO proved his dream true, bewraying the fell
stomach and shrewd nature of the said Prince, by the first experiments that he
could give thereof. For when his brother BRITANNICUS saluted him after he was
once adopted, (as his wonted manner was before) by the name of AENOBARBUS, he
went about to lay this imputation upon him before his Father, that he was some
Changeling and no son of his as he was reputed. His Aunt LEPIDA likewise
being in trouble, he deposed against, in the open face of the Court, thereby
to gratify his mother her heavy friend, and who followed the suite hotly
against her. Being honorably brought into the Or Hall of Justice
Forum, the day of his first plea and Commencement, he promised publicly for
the people a Congiarie, and Donative for the Soldiers. Having proclaimed also
a solemn Or running at tilt.
Iusting, himself rode before the Pretorian Soldiers bearing a shield in his
own hand. After this, he solemnly gave thanks to his Father in the Senate.
Before whom being then Consul, he made a Latin Oration in the behalf of the
Bononians, and for the Rhodians and Inhabitants of Ilium, another in Greek.

express commandment of CLAUDIUS forbidding the same, notwithstanding. Not
long after, he took to wife OCTAVIA: and for the good health of CLAUDIUS,
exhibited the Cirque Games and baiting of wild beasts.

8 Being seventeene years old, so soon as it was known abroad that CLAUDIUS
A. V, C* ^07
was dead, he came forth to those (of the Pretorian Cohort) that kept watch

dismal, there was no time thereof thought more auspicate and convenient than
it, to enter upon the Empire: and so before the Palace stairs being
proclaimed and saluted Emperor, he was in a Licter brought to the Pretorian.
Camp: and hastily from thence, after a short speech made unto the Soldiers,
conveied into the Curia. From whence he departed home in the evening* and of
those exceeding and infinite honors which were heaped upon him, he refused
only the Title in his style of Pater Father of his Country.
Patriae, in regard of his young years.

Beginning then with a glorious show of Piety and Kindness, at the Funerals 9
of The Emperor*
CLAUDIUS, which were most sumptuously performed, he praised him in an Oration
and consecrated him a God. In the memorial of his own Father DOMITIUS, he did
him right great honor. His mother he permitted to have the whole regiment of
all matters as well public as private. The very first day also of his Empire,
when the Tribune of the Or corpse de guard.

the old Soldiers out of the Praetorian cohort, and joining with them (by
translating their habitations) the richest Centurions who had been Leaders of
the foremost bands: where also he made a Or haven*

10 And to show a surer proof still of his towardness, after profession made
to govern the Empire according to the prescript rule of AUGUSTUS, he omitted
no occasion to show either bountifulness or clemency, no nor so much as to
testify his gentleness and courtesy. Those tributes and taxes which were any
thing heavy he either abolished quite or abated. The rewards due unto

also, yea and declaimed often publicly before them. He rehearsed his own
verses likewise, not only within house at home, but also in the Theater: and
that with so general a joy of as many as heard him; that for the said
rehearsal, there was a solemn procession decreed: and some of his said verses
written in golden letters were dedicated to JUPITER CAPITOLINUS.

11 Many and sundry kinds of shows he set forth: to wit, the Iuvenall ( a)
sports, the Circeian Games, and the Stage Plays: also a Sword fight. In the
Iuvenall pastimes, he admitted old men even those of Consuls degree: aged women
also and matrones to disport themselves. At the Circenses, he appointed places
for the Gentlemen of Rome a part by themselves* where he put also to run a
race for the prise chariots drawn with four Camels. In the Stage plays,
(which being instituted for the eternizing and perpetuity of his Empire he
would have to be called Maximi), very many of both Gentlemen and Senators*
degrees and sexes played their parts upon the Stage. A Roman Gentleman of

the Gymnick Games which he exhibited in the Septa, during the solemn
preparation of the great Sacrifice ( d) Buthysia, he cut off the first beard
that he had, which he bestowed within a golden box, adorned it with most
precious pearls and then consecrated it in To Jupiter Capitolinus:
the Capitol. To the show of wrestlers and other Champions he called also the

15 In his ordinary Jurisdiction, he lightly gave no answer to the Proctours
before the day following, and that was by writing. In extraordinary Commissions
and trials this course he held, namely to decide every cause by it self one
after another upon certain days of the Session; and to surcease quite the
hudling up and debatements of matters one in the neck of another: So often as
he went aside to consult, he did deliberate and ask advise of nothing either
in common or openly: but reading secretly to himself the opinions written by
every counselor; what liked his own self, that pronounced he, as if many
more thought well of the same. For a long time he admitted not the sons of
Libertines into the Curia: and to those that were admitted by the Emperors his
predecessors he denied all honorable Offices. If there sued for Magistracies
more then could speed, or were places void; to comfort their hearts again for
delaying and making them to stay longer, he gave unto them the conduct of
Legions. He granted for the most part all Consulships for six months term.

18 Having no will, no motion, nor hope at any time, to propagate and enlarge
the Empire, he thought once to have withdrawn the forces even out of Britain:
neither gave he over that intent of his, but only for very shame; least he
might be thought to deprave the glory of his Father (CLAUDIUS). Only the
realm of Pontus with the leave of POLEMON ( a), as also the Kingdom of the
Alps, by the death of King COTTIUS he reduced into the form of a Province.

19 Two voyages and no more he undertook, the one to Alexandria, the other
into Achaia. But his journey to Alexandria he gave over the very day of his
setting forth* by occasion that he was disquieted at once, both with a
religious scruple and also with some peril. For when he had gone in

forward I will make report.

20 Among other arts and sciences, being in his childhood trained up in the
skill also of music: no sooner attained he to the Empire, but he sent for
TERPNUS the harper, renowned in those days for his cunning above all other.
Sitting by him as he played and sung, day by day after supper until it was far
in the night, himself likewise by little and little began to practice and
exercise the same: yea and not to let pass any means, that expert
professors in that kind were wont to do, either for preserving or the
bettering and fortifying of their voices: even to wear before him upon his
breast a thin plate or sheet of lead: to purge by clystre and vomit: to abstain
from apples and fruit, with all such meats as were hurtful to the voice: so
long, until his proceedings still drawing him on, (a small and Or hoarse.
rusty voice though he had) he desired to come forth and show himself upon the
open stage, having among his familiar companions this greek proverb evermore
in his mouth, ( a) That hidden music was naught worth. The first time that he
mounted the stage was at Naples, where he gave not over singing, (albeit the
Theater was shaken and ready to fall by a sudden earthquake) before he had
finished the song begun. In the same place he chaunted often and many days
together. Moreover, after some short time between taken to repair his voice
(as one impatient of keeping within house) from the baines At Naples.
there he passed directly to the Theater: and having in the midst of the
Orchestra before a frequent multitude of people feasted and banquetted, made
promise in the Greek tongue, that if he had stippled a little and wet his
whistle, he would ring out some note more fully and with a stronger breast. Now,

they were to hear him): but it should be in his Hortyards. How beit, when the
corpse deguarde of the (Pretorian) Soldiers which at that time kept watch and
ward seconded the prayers of the commmon people, willingly he promised to
fulfill their minds out of hand in the very place; and without any farther
delay caused his own name to be written in the roll of other professed
minstrels and fingers to the harp. Thus having put his lot into the pitcher
with the rest, he entered the stage when his turn came: and withal the

Now when he had taken up his standing, and ended his Proaeme, he gave public
notice and pronounced by the voice of CLUVIVS RUFUS, (no meaner man than of
Consuls degree) that he would sing and act the story of Wife of Amph^on King
of Thebes who priding her self in her fair issewe^ sons and as many

bethinking himself that the time was long, he ceased not to come ever and
anon abroad to show his skill in open place. He stuck not also in Of other

face and of some woman whom he loved. Among the rest he chanced the tale of

22 Exceedingly given he was of a boy to delight in horsemanship, and with the
love of charioting mightily inflamed: and very much would he be talking
(forbidden though he were) of the Circeian games. And one time as he was
making moan, and bewailing among his skoole-fellowes, the hard fortune of a

from his retiring place of pleasure, to all the Circeian games even the very
least and meanest of them. First by stealth and privily: afterward in open
sight; so as no man made doubt, but at such a day he would be sure always
there to be. Neither dissimuled he that he was willing to augment the number
of the prises. And therefore the show of Chariot running was drawn out in
length and held until late in the evening, by occasion of many more courses
than ordinary: so as now the Masters of every faction deigned not to bring
forth their Greges either agi^atorum i. of chariot drivers: or equ^rum

whole day through. Soon after himself also would needs make one and be seen
oftentimes to play the Chariotier. And when he had tried what he could do,
and performed, as it were, his first Acts in (private) hortyardes among very
slaves and the base commons, he proceeded to show himself in the greatest
Cirque in all Men's eyes, appointing one of his freedmen to put out a (white)
towell for a signal, from the place where Magistrates are wont to do it. But
not content with this, that he had given good proof of his progress in these
feats at ROME, he goes, as I said before, into ACHAIA, moved especially upon
this occasion. Those Cities and states where solemn gamings of music are
usually held, had brought up a custom to send all the Coronets of
harpe-players unto him. This he accepted so kindly, that he not only admitted
at the very first to his presence the Ambassadors who brought the same, but
also placed them among his familiar guestes at the table. And being requested
by some of them to sing at supper time; and highly praised with excessive
applause, he came out with this speech That Gracians were the only skillful
Hearers, and the men alone worthy of his studies. Neither made he any longer
stay, but took his voyage: and no sooner was he passed over the sea to A
town in Corcyra.
Cassiope, but presently he began to sing at the altar there, of IVPITER CASIVS.

23 After this, he went to all the games of prise, one after another* For even
those that usually are celebrated at most remote and distant times he commanded

iterated. At Olympia likewise he caused, (contrary to the manner and custom
of that place) a game of music to be held. And least whiles he was busied
about these matters, any thing might either call him away or detain him: when
he was advertised by his freed-man HELIVS, that the City affairs required his
presence, he wrote back unto him in these words. Albeit your council to me
at this present and your willing desire is, that I should return with all
speed, yet ought you to advise me and wish rather, that I may return worthy
my self, that is to say, NERO. All the while he was singing, Lawefull it was
not for any person to depart out of the Theater, were the cause never so
necessary. Whereupon reported it is, that some great bellied women falling
into travail were delivered upon the very skaffolds: yea and many men besides,
weary of tedious hearing and praising him, when the town gates were shut,
either by stealth leapt down from the walls, or counterfeiting themselves
dead were carried forth as corses to be buried. But how timorously, with what
thought and anguish of mind, with what aemulation of his concurrents and fear
of the Vmpiers, he strove for the Mastery; it is almost incredible. His manner
was to deal with his adversaries, as if they had been but his aequals and of
the same condition with him, in this sort: namely, to observe, watch and mark
their behaviors; to ly in the wind for to catch advantage: to defame them
under hand, other whiles to rail at them and given them hard terms as they
came in his way: yea and to corrupt with Thereby to make them telent and not to
do their best.

VMPIERS aforesaid, he would speak unto them in all reverence before he
begun to sing, using these terms. That he had ^one whatsoever was to be
done: Howbeit, the issue and event was in the hand of For^une: They therefore,
as they were wisemen and learned ought to except and bar all chances and
mishaps. Now upon their exhortations unto him for to be hold and venturous, he
would indeed go away from them better appaied, but yet for all that, not
without pensive care and trouble of mind, finding fault also with the silence
and bashful modesty of some as if the same argued their discontended
heaviness and malicious repining, saying withal. That he had them in
suspicion.

24 During the time that he strove for to win any prise, so strictely
obeyed he the laws of the game, that he never durst once spit and reach up

which he happened to let fall, being much dismayed and in great fear, least
for that delinquencie he should be put from the stage: by no means took he
heart again, until an under actor or prompter standing by swear an oath that it
was not espied and marked for the shoutes and acclamations of the people
beneath. Now, whenever he wan the victory, he used to pronounce himself
victour. For which cause, he contended also in every place for the Due to him

token of any other victours ( c) in these sacred games beside himself, he
commanded all their statues, and images to be overthrowen, drawn with a drag

best game in many places, and at the Olympicke solemnities with one that had a
teeme of ten steedes, notwithstanding he reproved the very same in K.
MITHRIDATES as appeared by certain verses of his own making. But being once
shaken and hoisted out of his Chariot and set therein again, how be it not
able to hold out, he desisted and gave over, before he had run the race
through. Yet was he crowned nevertheless. After this, at his departure from
thence, he enfranchised the whole Province throughout: and withal, the Judges
of these Games he endowed with the freedom of Rome, and rewarded with great
sums of money. Which benefits of his himself published with his own voice
from the middle of the race, upon a day of the Isthmian games.

25 Being returned out of Greece he entered Naples; mounted upon a Chariot
drawn with white horses: For that, in the said City he had made profession
first of his skill, in (music) and a part of the wall was cast down against
his coming, (as the manner is of all victours in those sacred games).
Semblably rode he into ANTIVM, and from thence into ALBANVM and so forward into
ROME. But he entered ROME in the very same Chariot, wherein sometime AUGUSTUS

without a train also of ( a) Applauders following his Chariot, after the
manner of those that ride ovant in petie Triumph setting up a note, and crying
with a loud voice, That they were AUGUSTIANS, and the soldiers of his
triumph: From thence he rode forward, and having thrown down the Arch of the
greatest Cirque, he passed on through the Velabrum and market place, up to the
Palatium and so to the temple of APOLLO. To do him honor all the way as he
went, were beasts killed for sacrifice, and saffron estsoones strewed along the
streets. Birds were let fly, ribbands also and tabels yea and sweet
banketting junkets cast among. As for the sacred Coronets and guirlands

likewise his own statues pourtraied in the habit of an Or Minstre^

far was he from letting slack and remitting one joce his ardent study of his
music profession) that for the presentation of his voice he would never make

26 His unruly wildness, unbridled lust, wastfull riotousnesse, avarice and
cruelty, he practiced verily at first, by leisure closely, as the tricks of
youthful folly: yet so, as even then no man might doubt, that they were the
inbred vices of nature, and not the errors of young age. No sooner was it

For he used to fall upon those that came late from supper and knock them

named ( a) SPORUS, whose Genitories he cut out, and assayed thereby to
transform him into the nature of a woman. Him he caused to be brought unto him
as a bride, with a dowry, in a fine (yellow) ve^le, after the solemn manner of
marriage: not without a frequent and goodly train attending upon him: Whom he
maintained as his wife. Hereupon there goes abroad a pretty conceited jest of a
pleasant fellow. That it might have been well and happy with the World, if his
father DOMITIUS had wedded such a Wife. This SPORUS trimly set out with the
jewels, decked with the ornaments of the Empresses, and carried in a licter, he
accompanied all about the shire-townes of great resort and market burroughes of
Greece: yea and afterward at Rome, up and down the street Sigillaria, many a
time sweetly kissing him by the way. For, that he had a lust to ly with his
own mother, and was frighted from it by some depraving backefriendes of hers;
for fear, least the proud and insolent dame might by this kind of favor grow
too mighty, no man ever made doubt: especially after that he entertained among
his Concubines an harlot, most like in all points (by rereport) unto AGRIPPINA.
It is affirmed moreover, that in times past, so often as he rode in a licter
together with his mother, he played the filthy wanton, and was bewrayed by the
marks and spots appearing upon her vesture.

29 As for his own body, CERTES, he forfeited the honor thereof, prostituting
it to be abused so farreforth, as having defiled in manner all the parts of

had given commandment, that all prisoners wheresoever should be transported
into Italy: and that no person attaint and convict of any wicked act, should
be condemned otherwise, but to work thereat.

To these outrageous expenses, beside the trust and confidence he had in the 32
revenewes of the Empire, put forward he was upon a certain unexpected hope
also that he co^ceived, of finding a world of wealth: and that through
intelligence given unto him by a ge^tleman of Rome, who assured him upon his

that the rich treasure and old store of silver and gold both, which Queen
DIDO flying out of Tyros carried away with her, lay buried in Affricke within
most huge and vaste caves under the ground, and might be gotten forth with some
small labor of those that would go about it. But when this hope failed him
and came to nothing, being now altogether destitute, and so far exhaust and
bare of money, that of necessity even soldiers pay, and the fees due unto
old seruitours in the wars for their service must run on still and be
differred; he bent his mind to promoting of false imputations, to pilling also

and contumelious manner, both in word and deed, every way: taunting and
twitting him, one while with his folly, another while with his cruelty. For,
in scoffing wife he would say of him that he had left now ( a) morari) any
longer among mortal men, using the first syllable of the said word long. And
many of his decrees and constitutions he annulled as the acts of a doltish and
doting man. Finally, he neglected the Bustu^

in remembrance of his Father, he attempted to make him away by poison* This
poison, NERO had received at the hands of one LOCUSTA, a woman who appeached
and brought to light diverse confectioners of poisons: and seeing it wrought

operation. And then having made trial thereof in a kid, after he saw once that
the beast continued five hours before it dyed, he caused the same to be boiled
again and many times more, and so he set it before a pig. And when the pig
dyed presently upon the taking thereof, he commanded it should be brought into
his refection chamber, and given unto BRITANNICUS as he sat at supper with him.
No sooner had he tasted it but he fell down dead. NERO readily made a lie and
gave it out among the rest of his guests, that BRITANNICUS was surprised by a
fit of the falling sickness, as his manner was to be. But the next morrow, in
all have he took order for his corpse to be carried forth to burial, with no
better funerals than ordinary; and that, in an exceeding great storm of

and depart to Rhodes. Soon after, he deprived her of all honor, dignity, and
authority: and removing from about her the guard Militum, e^ German^rum, Hen

the same house with him, and so forth out of the precincts of the Palace:
Neither cared he what he did, so he might molest and trouble her: suborning
some of purpose, both to disquiet her whiles she abode in Rome with suites and
actions; and also when she was desirous of repose and ease in a retiring place
out of the way, to course her with reproachful taunts and flouting scoffs as
they passed that way either by land or sea. But being terrified with her
threats and violent shrewdness, he determined to kill and dispatch her at
once. Having attempted it with poison thrice, and perceiving that she was
defended with Antidotes and preservatives; he provided a bedchamber for her,
with so ticklish an arched roufe over her head, as being easily unioincted,
the frame there of might fall in pieces in the night, and light upon her as she

some of the accomplices privy thereto; he devised a ship, so made, as that
quickly it should cleave a sunder: that either by the wrack, or fall of the
fore-deck aloft, she might come to a mischief and perish. And so, making a
semblance of a Love-day and reconciliation, he sent for her by most sweet and
kind Letters, training her unto Baiae, there to celebrate with him the
solemnity of the A feast in the honor of Minerra, beginning five days before

him, caused the said AGERINUS to be apprehended and bound with chains: and
withal, his mother aforesaid, to be murdered: pretending, as if by voluntary
death she had avoided the odious crime thus detected, and so made her self

that by Authors of good credit and who will stand to it: Namely, That he ran in

jewels and ornaments only of a wife ought to content her. Soon after, when he
had assayed many times (but in vain) to strangle her, he put her away,
pretending she was barraine. But when the people misliked this divorse, and
forbear not to rail upon him for it, he proceeded, even to confine and banish
her quite. In the end he murdered her, under a colorable imputation of diverse
adulteries, charged upon her so impudently and falsely; That al generally who
were by torture examined upon the point, stood stoutly to the very last in
denial, he suborned and brought in ANICETUS his own Paedagogue against her;
who should slander himself with her and confess that by a wile he had abused

With no less cruelty raged he abroad even against strangers and mere 36
forainers. A blazing hairy star, commonly thought to portend death and
destruction to the highest poures, began to arise, and had appeared many nights
together. Being troubled therewith, and informed by BABILUS the Astrologer,
that Kings were wont to expiate such prodigious signs with some notable
massacre, and so divert the same from themselves, and turn all upon the heads
of their Peers and Nobles, he thereupon projected the death of all the Noblest
personages in the City. And verily, so much the rather, and, as it were, upon
just cause, by reason of two conspiracies by him published and divulged abroad:
of which, the former and the greater, bearing the name of And his frie^d^

accord, so And, by name Sulpitius Asper.
others said moreover, That he was beholden unto them for it, because they
could not possibly do a cure upon him by any other means, (disteined as he
was and dishonored with all kind of wicked acts) but only by death. The
children of the condemned were expelled the City, and then, dispatched with
poison or hungerstarued. It is for certain known, that some of them with
their paedagogues and booke-keepers took their bane all at one dinner
together, others were restrained for seeking and earning their daily food.

37 After this without all choice and respect, without all measure in his hand,
he spared none: he put to death whomsoever it pleased him, and for what cause
it skilled not. But not to make long relation of many, It was laid to
SALUIDIENUS ORCITUS charge, that he had set and let three shops out of his
house about the Foru^, unto the Cities and States abroad for (their
Ambassadors) for to make their abode and converse in. To CASSIUS LONGINUS the

behind, but one day utterly raze that Order and degree out of the
commonwealth, and permit the gentlemen of Rome and his freed-men (only to rule

38 But yet for all that, he spared not the people nor forbear the very walls and
buildings of his country the City. When one in common talk upon a time
chanced to say.

And even so he did indeed: for being offended, as it were with the ill

winding streets; he set the city of Rome on fire so apparently, that many

he said himself) at the beautiful flame that it made, chaunted the winning and
destruction of Troie, in that Musicians habit wherein he was wont to sing upon
the stage. And because he would not miss, but lay fast hold upon all the

having promised free leave to cast forth dead karkasses, and rid away the

substance unburnt, he permitted not one to go unto it. Finally, not only by
receiving, but also by exacting Contributions from all parts, he beggered well

nothing less to the heart, than the shrewd checks and reviling taunts of Men:

So that he might the better be excused and borne with all for studying and
practicing the art of minstrelsie and singing to the harp, as a skill
delightful unto him now a Prince, and needful for him another day a private
person. Yet some there were who promised unto him so forsaken, the government of
the East parts: and others by special name the kingdom of Jerusalem: but
most of them warranted him assuredly the restitution of his former estate. And
being inclined rather to rest upon this hope, when he had lost Britain and
Armenia, and recovered them both again: he thought himself discharged then
and quit from the fatal calamities destined unto him. But sending one time to
the Oracle of APOLLO at Delphi, and hearing this answer from thence ( a) That
he must beware of the year 73, as who would say, He was to dye in that year
(of his own age) and not before; and divining no whit of GALBAHS years; with
so assured confidence he conceived in his heart not only long life but also a
perpetual and singular felicity, that when he had lost by ship wrack things
of exceeding price, he stuck not to say among his familiars. That the As they

fishes would bring the same again unto him. At Naples advertised he was of
the rebellion in Gaul. Which fell out to be the very same day of the year, on
which he had killed his mother. But he took this news so patiently and
carelessly, that he gave suspicion even of joy and contentment: as if occasion
had been offered and presented thereby to make spoil (by the law of arms)
of those most rich and wealthy Provinces: and straight ways going forth into
the Public place of exercise.
Gymnase, he beheld with exceeding great earnestness and delight the wrestlers
and champions striving for the prise. At supper time also, being interrupted
with letters importing more tumults and troubles still: Thus far forth only
he grew into choler and indignation, as that he threatened Malum an Emphaticall

had revolted. To conclude, for eight days together he never went about to
write back unto any man nor to give any charge or direction at all, but buried
the matter quite in silence.

At the last, thoroughly moved and netled with the contumelious edicts 41
of vindex coming so thick one in the neck of another, he exhorted the
Senate, in a letter written unto them, to revenge him and the commonwealth:
alleging for an excuse the An infla^m ation or swel ling in the throat.
Squinsie whereof he was sick: and therefore could not himself be present in
person. But nothing vexed him so much as this, That he was by him blamed for
an unskilful* musician, and because in steed of NERO, he called him Which was
the name of his family, and so had he been called before his adoption.
AENOBARBUS. And verily as touching this name appropriate to his house and
family; wherewith he was thus in contumelious manner twitted, he professed to
resume the same, and to lay away the other that Nero Claudius Drusus
came by adoption. All other reviling taunts and slanders he confuted as
mere false, by no other, argument than this. That unskilfulnesse, forsooth,
was objected unto him in that very art, which he had so plainly studied and
brought to so good perfection: and therewith asked them eftsoon one by one,
whether they had ever known a more excellent Musician than himself. But when
messengers came still one after another, in great fear he returned to Rome.
And having his heart lightened but a little in the way, with a vain and foolish
pr^sage by occasion that he espied and observed engraven upon a monument, a
certain french soldier with a Roman knight overmatched in fight and trailed
along by the hair (of the head): he at this sight leapt for joy and worshipped
the heavens. Neither then verily, did he so much as consult in public with
the Senate, or assemble the people: but only call forth home to his house some
of the chief and principal persons among them. And having dispatched in great
haste this consultation, the rest of that day he led them all about to his
musical water instruments of a strange devise and fashion, not before known:
and showing every one by it self unto them, discoursing also of the reason and
difficult workmanship of each one, he promised even anon to bring them all
forth into the open Theater, Which it seems he spoke ironically, if simply, he
mea neth, in case Vindex interupted not his sports and the public felicity.
If VINDEX would give him leave,

42 After that he understood besides, how GALBA likewise and the provinces of
Spain were revolted, he fell down at once: his heart was then daunted and
clean done: and so he lay a good while speechless in a trance, and ready, as
one would say, to go out of the world. And so soon as he came again to
himself, he rent his clothes, beat and knocked his head, saying plainly That
he was utterly undone: yea and when his nource came about him to comfort his
poor heart, telling him, that the like accidents had befallen to other princes
also before him, he answered again, That he above all the rest suffered
miseries never heard of nor known before: Thus in his life time to forgo and
loose his Empire. Neither yet for all this struck he sail one whit in laying
away or leaving out one jot of his ordinary riot and supine slothfulness. Nay
when some little inckling was given of good news out of the provinces as he
sat at a most sumptuous and plentiful supper; he pronounced even with
express gesture like a player, certain ridiculous rimes, and those set to
lascivious and wanton measures, against the chiefetaines of rebellion: and what
were those? even stale stuff and commonly known already. Being also secretly
conveyed into the Theater he sent word unto a certain Player acting his part
with great co^tentment of them that saw and heard him, That he did but abuse
his In that he played without a concurrent whereas himself but for his
Businesses would have put him down,
occupations.

43 Immediately upon the beginning of this fearful c Ocasioned by the
Commotions and re volts abroad
tumult, it is credibly thought that he intended many designs and those very
cruel and horrible: yet such as agreed well enough with his natural humor:
namely, to send under hand successors and murderers of all those that were
Commanders of armies and regents of Provinces; as if they all had conspired and
drawn in one and the self same line. Item, to massacre all banished persons
where soever; and the frenchmen every one that were to be found in Rome: those
because they should not band and combine with them that revolted: these, as
accomplices with their own contrie men, and their abbetters. Item to permit, the
armies for to make spoil and havocke of the Provinces in Gaul. Item to poison
all the Senate generally at some appointed feast. Last of all to fire Rome and
let wild beasts loose among the people; that thereby there might be more ado
and greater difficulty to save the City. But being skared from these
designments, not so much upon any repentance, as despair of their
accomplishment: and persuaded withal, that necessary it was to make a voyage
and warlike expedition; the Consuls then in place he deprived of their
government before the due time, and himself alone entered upon the Consulship in
their rooms, as if forsooth, the destinies had so ordained, that Gaul could
not be subdued but by a (sole) As sometime On Pomp^ius ma^nus was, for the like

knitches of rods, when after meat he withdrew himself aside out of his dining
chamber, leaning upon the shoulders of his familiar friends, he protested,
that so soon as ever he was come into the Province: he would show himself
unarmed before the armies: and do nothing else but weep. and after he had once
by that means reclaimed the authors of the Revolt and brought them to
repentance, sing merrily, the day following, songs of triumph with them that
rejoiced with him. Which songs quoth he ought with all speed even now to be
composed for me.

44 In the preparation of this warlike voyage, his special care was, to choose
forth meet wagons for the carriage of his musical instruments; to cut and poll
the concubines which he carried out with him like men: and to furnish them with
battle axes and little bucklers after the Amazonian fashion. This done, he
cited the Citie-tribes to take the military oath: and when no serviceable me^
would answer to their names, he enjoined all Masters to set forth a certain
number of bond-seruants, neither admitted he out of the whole family and
hovshold of every man, but such only as were most approved, excepting not so
much as their stewards or clerks and secretaries. He commanded likewise all
degrees to allow and contribute toward this expedition part of their estate
according as they were valued in the Censors book: and more than so, The
tenants inhabiting private messuages and great houses standing by them selves,

and full of risings: gold pure and red as fire. In so much, as most men openly
refused the payment of all contributions: demanding in a general consent, that
what moneys soever promoters had received for their informations, should rather
be required back again at their hands.

45 By the dearth likewise of corn, look what hatred was conceived against
the i. Cornemu^gers lucrantium
gainers, the same grew heavy upon him. For it fell out by chance that in
this public famine word came of a Or the fleet^ it self, nauis proc^asse as

saw the helm of a ship wrested out of his hand as he steered it: and that by
his wife OCTAVIA he was haled into a very narrow and blind place: one while
that he was covered all over with a multitude of winged ants; another while,
that the images of grave men descended of noble houses dedicated in POMPEIUS
Theater, went round about him, and debarred him from going forward. Also, that
his ambling guelding, wherein he took most delight, was in most parts
transfigured into the form of an ape: But having his head only sound and

took the greatest pleasure to drink, and which he called Homericos, for

fleet to sea, He sounded the Tribunes and Centurious of the guard, whether they
^ould be are him company and fly with him, or no? But when some of them made

cogitation of this matter unto the next day, and Or starting out of his sleep^*
awakened about midnight; when he understood that the guard of his Soldiers
was retired and gone, he leapt forth of his bed, and sent all about to his
friends. But because no word was brought back from any of them, himself
accompanied with a few about him went to every one of their lodgings: Where
finding all doors shut, and no body to make him answer, he returned to his bed
chamber. By which time, his Keepers also and Warders were slipped from thence:
but they had stolen away first the hangings and furniture of his chamber, yea

48 But having reclaimed once again that violent mood, he desired some more
secret retyring place, wherein he might lurk a while and recall his wits
together. And when PHAON his freed man made offer unto him of a Farm house of

so covering his head, and holding an hand kercheife before his face, to
horseback he went; having not above four persons in his company; of which*

by and by affrighted with an Earthquake and lightning that flashed against his

the passengers that he met, saying, These be they that pursue NERO, as also

and stuck therein, and so creeping upon all four through a straight and
narrow hole dug in the wall for him, received he was into the next back
room: Where he laid him down on a pallet made of a simple scant mattrice, and
an old over-worne cloak cast over it for a coverlet. Now when hunger came
upon him, and thirst with all the second time, the brown and course bread
verily which was offered unto him he refused; but of warm water he drank a
pretty draught.

49 When as each one called then instantly on every side upon him, to deliver
him self with all speed from the reproachful contumelies and abuses, whereto
he was hourly subject, he commanded a grave to be made before his face, and
gave a measure therefore according to the just proportion of his body: and
therewith, if any pieces of marble stone might be found about the house, to be
laid in order: That water also and wood should be gotten together for his dead
body to be washed anon therewith: weeping at every word he spoke, and

word he yielded up his breath, with his eyes staring out and set in his head,
to the great fear and horror of all that were present. He had requested of
the company which attended upon him, no one thing more earnestly than this.
That no man might have his head severed from the body but that in any wise he

complet height. His body full of specks and freckles, and foul of skin
besides. The hair of his head somewhat yellow: His countenance and visage
rather fair, than lovely and well favored. His eyes gray and somewhat with
the dimmest. His neck full and fat. His belly and paunch bearing out: with a
pair of passing slender spindle shanks: but withal, he was very healthful.
For, being as he was so untemperate and most royotously given, in 14 years
space, he never fell sick but thrice: yet so, as he neither so: bare drinking
of wine, nor any thing else that he used to do. About the trimming of his
body and wearing of his clothes so nice, as it was shameful: in so much as
he would always have the bush of his head laid and plaited by curles in

neck he went abroad in the Streets, ungirt, untrussed, and unshod.

52 Of all the Liberal Sciences in manner, he had a taste when he was but a
child. But from the Study of Philosophy his mother turned his mind; telling
him, It was repugnant to one who another day was to be a Sovereign: and from
the knowledge of ancient Orators, his Master SENECA withdrew him, because
he would hold him the longer in admiration of himself. And therefore, being
of his own accord readily inclined to Poetry, he made verses voluntarily and
without pain. Neither did he (as some think) set forth other men's Poems as his
own. There have come into mine hands writing tables and books containing
verses very famous and well known abroad, written with his own hand: so as a
man may easily see they were not copied out of other books, nor yet taken from
the mouth of any other that indicted them, but plainly penned as a man would
say, by one that studied for them, and as they came in his head, so put them
down: so many blots and skrapings out, so many dashes and interlinings were in
them.

No small delight he had beside in painting; and most of all in forging and
moolding 53
counterfaites. But above all, he was ravished and lifted up with popularity
and praise of men: desirous therefore to imitate and equal them, who by any
means plea sed the humors and contented the minds of the common people. There
went an opinion and speech of him, that after he had gained the Coronets for
his musical fears performed upon the stage, he would at the next five years
revolution, go unto the Olympicke games, and contend for the prise among the
Champions there. For, he practiced wrestling continually. Neither beheld he the
Gymnicke games throughout all Greece otherwise, than sitting below within the

Or couples matched.
paires of them drew to far back out of the appointed place, to pluck them
with his own hands into the middle again. He had intended moreover (since he
was reputed to have equalled APOLLO in singing and matched the Sun in
charioting) to imitate also the worthy acts of HERCULES. And men say, there
was a Lion prepared, which he, all naked should either with his club brain, or
else with straight clasping beetweene his arms throttle and crush to death
within the Amphitheatre, in the sight of all the people.

54 Certainly, a little before his end he had openly made a vow, That in
case he continued still in good and happy estate, represent he would likewise
at the games, in his own person after victory obtained, an Organist and player
upon water instruments, upon the flute also and hauthors, yea and a bagpiper,
and on the last day (of the said games) an actor of Enterludes: what time he
would aaunce and gesture Turnus in Virgill. And some write, that PARIS the
actor was by him killed, as a concurrent that stood in his way and eclipsed his
light.

55 A desire he had, (foolish and inconsiderate though it were) of aeternity
and perpetual fame. And therefore, abolishing the old names of many things and
places, he did upon them new, after his own. The month April also he
called Neroneus. He meant moreover to have named Rome, Neroes City.
Neropolis.

All Religions whersoever he had in contempt, unless it were that only of the

obscure person, as a remedy, forsooth, or desensative against altreacheries
and secret practices: and thereupon straight ways chauncing to discover a
conspiracy; he held it for the sovereign deity above all, and persisted
honoring and worshipping it every day with 3 sacrifices. Nay he would have men
believe, that he foreknew things to come by advertisement and warning given
from her. Some few months before he lost his life, he took regard also of the
Skill in prying into beasts entrails. Which he observed in deed, but never
sped well therewith, nor gained thereby the favor of the Gods.

not some, who a long time after decked his Tomb with gay flowers that the
Spring and Summer do affourd: and who, one while brought forth his Images clad
in robes embrodred with purple gards before the Rostra: otherwhile published
his Edicts, as if he had been yet living and would shortly return to the
great mischief of his enemies. Moreover, VOLOGESUS King of the Parthians, when
he senthis Ambassadors unto the Senate for to treat about the renewing of
league and Alliance with them, requested this also very earnestly, That the
Memorial of NERO might be still solemnized. To conclude, when twenty years

THE HISTORY OF Servius Sulpitius Galba,
written by Caius Suetonius Tranquillus.


THE Or line:
Progeny of the CAESAR'S ended in NERO. Which, Chap 1
that it would so come to pass, appeared verily by many signs, but by two of
all other most evident. As LIVIA in times past immediately after her marriage
with AUCUSTUS, went to see a Manor house and land of her own in the
veientane Territory, it fortuned that an Eagle soaring over her head let fall
into her lap a white hen, holding in her bill a Laurel branch even as she had
caught it up. And thinking it good to have both the foul kept, and the said
branch set in the ground: behold there came of the one such a goodly brood of

whole grove of bay trees withered to the very root, but all the hens there
died every one. And anon after the Temple of the CAESAR'S being strucke^ with
lightning, the heads with all of their Statues fell down all at once, and the
Scepter of AUGUSTUS was shaken out of his hands.

his own family will I briefly touch. The first of all the SVLPITII, why? and
whereupon he bare the surname of GALBA? there is some doubfull question. Some
think it came by occasion of a Town in Spain, which after it had been a
long time in vain assaulted, he at length set on fire with burning brands

he had, he used continually Galbeum, that is to say, a cure with remedies A

For when all men besides, abhorred this foul and monstrous prodigy, he alone
took it to be most fortunate: calling to remembrance the fore said sacrifice

salute him with a good morrow, and in the eueninge take their leave likewise
with a farewell and also good night.

Among the liberal Sciences he gave himself to the study of the (Civil)

He entered also into the state of wedlock, but having buried his wife LEPIDA,

very grievously) the day appointed for to set forth in the British expedition
was differred. He governed Africa as Proconsul two years: being elected

warning and direction given him in a dream) fetched out of an inward and
secret vault of the Temple, delivered them likewise by a maiden which had the
spirit of prophecy. The meaning and effect of which verses was, That one day

every Province, counselling and persuading all and some to join with him in
these designements: and (proportionally to the means that every one had) to
help and promote the common cause. Much about the same time, in the
fortification of a town which he had chosen to be the Capital seat of the
war, a Ring was found of Antique work, in the Gemm or stone whereof was
engraven the express resemblance of ( a) victory together with a ( b)

received as a present at the hands of a freed man of NERORS, missed but little

11 Besides these dangers so great, there fell out (to help the matter well)
the death of VINDEX. wherewith being most of all amassed, and like to a man
utterly forlorn, he went within a little of renouncing this world and forgoing
his own life. But by occasion of messengers coming with news from the City
in the very instant, no sooner understood he that NERO was slain, and all men
in general had swome allegiance unto him, but he laid away the name of
Lieutenant and took upon him the style of CAESAR. So, he put himself on his

12 There had a rumor been raised before of his cruelty and covetousness
both: for punishing the Cities of Spain which were somewhat slack in coming
to side with him, by saying very heavy tributes and taxes upon them: some of
them also by dismanteling and rasing their walls: likewise for putting to death
certain Presidents and Procuratours together with there wives and children: as
also for melting a Coronet of gold weighing 15. pound: which the men of
Tarracon from out of the old Temple of IVPITER had presented unto him: and
commanding that the three ounces which wanted of the full weight should be
exacted and made good. This report was both confirmed and also increased upon
his first entrance into Rome. For when he would have compelled the servitours
at Sea (whom * Either by wast in melting or by the crafty conueiance of the

NERO had made of mariners and oaremen, full and lawful soldiers) to return
again to their former state and condition: when they made refusal, and
besides called malapertly for their Aegle and other military ensigns: he not
only sent in, among them a troop of horsemen and so trod them under foot;
but also executed with death every tenth man of them. Semblably, the Cohort of
Germans which in times past had been by the CAESAR'S ordained for the guard
of their persons, and by many good proofs were found most trusty, he
dissolved: and without any availes and recompense for their service sent them
home again into their Country: pretending that they stood better affected unto
CN. DOLAEELLA (nee^ unto whose Horthyards and gardens they quartered) than to
him. Moreover, these reports also (whether truly or falsely I wot not) went

for his labor five good Deniers, and those he drew with his own hand out of
his privy purse.

At his first coming therefore, he was not so welcome. And that appeared at 13
the next solemnity of public Shows. For when as in the Atellane Comaedies,
some had begun a most vulgar Canticle with this verse,

heard. The Freedom of Rome City he seldom granted to any. The privilege
and Immunitie due to those who had three children, he gave to one or two at
most with much a-doe: nor to them verily, but for a certain time limited and
set down. The Judges making suite for to have a sixth Decurie adjoined unto
them, he not only denied flatly, but also this benefit of vacation granted
unto them by CLAUDIUS. That they should not be called forth to sit in the
Winter ( a) season, and at the beginning of the year, he took from them.

15 It was thought also, that he purposed to determine and limit the Offices
belonging to Senators and Gentlemen, within the compass of two years: and
not to bestow the same but upon such as were unwilling and refused to take
them. The Liberalities and bountiful Which amounted according to Tacitus into

same should be taken from the Buiers, since that the parties who had sold the
same had spent the money, and were not sufficient to repay it. Contrariwise,
there was not any thing, but by the means of his followers, Favorites and
freed men, he suffered either to be purchased for money, or granted freely
for favor: as for example, Customs, ^posts, Immunities, Punishments of the
Innocent, and Impunitie of Malefactors. Moreover, when as the people of Rome
called upon him for Justice, and namely to have HALOTUS and TIGELLINUS
executed, the only men of all the bloud-hounds and instruments of N^RO that
wrought most mischief, he saved them from danger: and besides, advaunced
HALOTUS to a most honorable Procuratorship: and in the behalf of TIGELLINUS
rebuked the people by an Edict for their cruelty unto him.

displeasure and ill will most of the Soldiers. For, when his Provosts had
promised and pronounced unto them, (what time they swear allegiance unto him),
a greater Donative than usually had been given, he would not make good and
ratify the same; but eft-soones gave it out, That his manner had ever been to
choose and not buy his Soldiers. And as, upon that occasion verily he
angered all his Soldiers wheresoever: so, the Pretorians and those of his

indignities; namely, by removing and displacing most of them one after another,
as suspected persons, and the adhaerents of NYMPHIDIUS. But the forces of
higher Germany grumbled and fumed most of all, for being defrauded of their
rewards for service performed against the French and Vindex. They were the
first therefore that durst break out into open disobedience: and upon the
Newyeeres day refused to take an oath and bind themselves in allegiance unto
any other than the Senate of Rome. They intended also to dispatch forthwith an
Embassy unto the Pretorian guard, with these advertisements and messages from
them, Namely, That they were displeased with an Emperor made in Spain: and
therefore themselves should elect one, whom all the Armies in General might
allow and approve.

18 Many prodigious sights and those presented continually even from the
very first beginning, had portended unto him such an end as ensued. When all
the way as he iourneyed, beasts were sacrificed to do him honor in every
town on both sides, it chanced that a Bull astonished with the stroke of the
Butchers axe, brake the bond wherewith he stood tied and ran^ full upon his
Chariot; and rising up with his (fore) feet, all to be spr^inct and d^enched
it with blood. As he alight out of it, one of the guard and Pensioners about
him, with the thrusting of the throng had like with his spear to have wounded
him. As he entered also the City of Rome and so passed forward up to the
P^latium; he was welcomed with an Earthquake, and a certain noise resembling
the lowing of a beast. But there followed after these, greater Prodigies still
and more fearful. He had selected and laid by it self out of all his
Treasure, a jewel set thick with pearl and precious stones, for to beautify
and adorn his Goddess Fortune at Tusculum. This Jewel (as if it had been
worthy of a more stately and sacred place), all of a sudden he dedicated to
VENUS in the Capitol, and the next night following he dreamt, that he saw
Fortune making her moan and complaining, how she was defrauded of the gift
intended and meant unto her: threatening withal, that she her self also would
take away what she had given him. Now, being aff^ighted with this vision, when

what speed he could and go forward thither (for why? by his authority and
presence he might bear sway and prevail) he resolved to do no more but
keep close within house: to stand upon his guard, and to fortify himself
with the strength of his legionarie Soldiers, in many and diverse places
quartered. Howbeit, he put * (...).

obsequions service they could: He to meet them went forth; and that with so
great confidence as that unto a Soldier who made his boast, He had slain

wonderful thing it was, that of those who were there present not one went
about to help their Emperor: and all that were sent for, rejected the
messenger, saving only a guidon of Germane Horsemen. These in regard of his

THE HISTORY OF Marcus Salvius Otho,
written by Caius Suetonius Tranquillus.


THE Ancestors of OTHO had their beginning in a town^ Chap. 1
called Ferentinum; extract out of an ancient and honorable family, even from
the Princes of Hetruria. His grandfather M. SALVIUS OTHO having for his Father
a Gentleman of Rome, and for his mother a woman of base condition (and whether
she was freeborn or no? it is uncertain) through the favor of LIVIA
AUGUSTA, in whose house he had his rising and growth, was made a Senator, and
exceeded not the degree of a Pretour. His Father, L. OTHO by his mothers side
of right noble blood descended, and thereby allied to many great kinreds, was
so dear and in face so like unto TIBERIUS the Emperor, that most men believed
verily, he was his own son. The Honorable Offices within the City: the
Proconsulship of Asia, and other extraordinary places of Conduct and Command,
he managed most severely. He adventured also in Illyricum to pro ceed so far,
as to put certain soldiers to death, for that in the commotion of CAMILLVS
upon a touch of conscience they had killed their Or his. i. Ca^,
Captains and provosts, as authors of the revolt and rebellion against
CLAUDIUS, and verily this execution himself in person saw performed in the
Camp ( a) even before the Prin cipia: notwithstanding that he knew they were
for that service advanced to higher places by CLAUDIUS. By which act of his as
he grew in glory so he decreased in favor. And yet the same he soon
recovered again, by detecting the perfidious plot of a Roman Knight, whom by
the appeachment of his own servants he found to have attempted the death of
CLAUDIUS. For, both the Senate endowed him with an honor most rare and seldom
seen, to wit his own statue erected in the Palatium; and also CLAUDIUS when
he ranged him among the Patritians, and in most honorable terms praised him
added these words withal, He is a man, than whom I would not wish I assure
you to have better Children of mine own. Of ALBIA TERENTIA a right noble and
gallant Lady he begat two sons, LUCIUS TITIANVS, and a younger forenamed

affianced unto DRVSVS the son of GERMANICVS.

From the very prime of his youth, he was roiotous, wild and wanton: in so
much as his father swindged him well and soundly for it: reported also to use
night walking; and as he met any one either feeble or cupshorten or overcome
with drink to catch hold of him, lay him upon a soldiers gaberdine, and so (
b) to toss and hoist him up into the air. Afterward, upon his fathers
death, a certain Libertine woman of the Court, a dame very gracious (because
he would make the more benefit by following and courting her as his mistrisse)
he pretended love unto: albeit an old trot she was in manner doting for age.
By her means winding himself into the favor of NERO, he easily obtained the
chief place among his minions and favorites (such was the congruence of their
humors and dispositions) and as some write by mutual abusing also of one
another body against kind. But so mighty he waxed and bare such a side, as
that in consideration of a great piece of money agreed upon, he presumed to
bring into the Senate house for to give For pardon

3 Being now, as he was, privy and party to all the counsels and secret
dessignes of NERO: he to auert all manner of suspicion, that very day which
NERO had appointed for the murdering of his mother, entertained them both at
supper withmost exquisite, and the kindest welcome that might be. Semblably,

heart from NERO and used her body, he loved her so entirely, that he could not
endure NERO himself to be his Partner with him in love of that Mistress
Corrivall. Certes, it is thought of a truth, that not only the messengers who
were sent to fetch her, came again without her: but also that one time he kept

threats also and prayers intermingled, demanding his pledge or gage, to wit

every man a piece of 15, S. 7. D, ob, English,
gold: and no less careful was he to oblige unto him one way or other, the
rest of the soldiers. And when one of them went to law with his neigh bour
about a parcel of ground in the skirts and confines of both their lands, he
being chosen Arbitratour, bought the whole land for the said soldier and
enfeoffed him in it. So as now by this time there was scarce one, but both
thought and said that he alone was worthy to succeed in the Empire.

5 Moreover he had fed himself with hopes to have been adopted by GALBA and
that looked he for daily: But after that PISO was preserred and himself
disappointed of his hope, he turned to plain violence: pricked thereto, over
and besides the coffeehouse of his mind, by occasion that he was so deeply
indebted. For he stuck not to profess. He was not able to stand, unless he
were Emperor: And it skilled not whether he were over thrown by his enemy in
the field, or fell under his creditours hands at the Bar. Some few days
before, he had fetched over one of CAESAR'S servants in a millene of Sesterces
for the obtaining of a Stewardship: and with the help of this sum of money,
enterprised he so great a project. At the first he committed the matter to 5.

those not very many: as making no doubt but presuming confidently of this that
a number besides would be ready in the very action to second it.

6 He had minded once, presently after the adoption (of PISO) to seize their
camp into his own hands, and so to set upon GALBA as he sat at supper in
the Palace: but the respective regard he had of the Cohort, which then kept
watch and ward, he checked this intent of his: for fear least the same
should incur the into lerable hatred of the world: considering, by the guard
of that very Cohort, CAIUS had been slain before, and NERO perfidiouslie
betrayed afterward. Moreover, exception was taken against the middle time

upon a 15 lanu^rij
day appointed, after warning given aforehand unto those that were privy to
the conspiracy, for to attend him in the market place at the golden ( a)
Milliarium under the Temple of Saturn, he faluted GALBA in the morning, and
(as the manner was) being received with a kiss, was present also as he
sacrificed and heard the Soothsayers pred^ctions. Which done, a freed man of
his brought him word that the Architects were come (this was the watchword
agreed upon between the^) whereupon as if forsooth he were to look upon an house
that was to be sold, he departed, gat him quickly away through the back side
of the Palace, and hied a pace toward the place appointed. Others say, that he

himself would have and hold no more, then just that which they would leave for
him.

7 This done, as the day drew toward evening he entered into the Senate: and
briefly laying before them a reason of his proceeding, as if he had been
carried away perforce out of the market place and compelled to take the Empire
upon him (which he would administer according to the general will and pleasure
of the^ al), to the palace he goes. Now when as beside other sweet and
plausible words delivered by such as did congratulate and flatter him, he was

distressed as well with famine, as the straight wherein he was pent, yet
resolved he with all speed, to hazard the fortune of the field and to try it

straight ways in a melancholy, he conceived a resolution to make him self
away (as many are of opinion and not without cause) rather for shame, that he
would not be thought to persevere in the maintenance of his sovereign dominion
with so great jeopardie of the State and loss of men, than upon any despair
or distrust of his forces. For still there remained a puissant army whole and
entier, which he had detained with him for trial of better fortune: and
another pour was coming out of Dalmatia, Pannonia and Maesia. Neither verily
were they discomfited so much daunted and dejected, but that, for to be
revenged of this disgrace and shameful foil, ready they were of themselves,
and alone without help of others, to undergo, any hard adventure whatsoever.

related at the table the end of CASSIVS and BRUTUS, he fell a quaking and

but that he confidently thought, the quarrel might have ended without war.
Well then, upon a new accident incited he was to the contempt of this present
life, even by the example of a common and ordinary soldier: who reporting this
overthrowe of the army, when he could of no man have credit, but was charged
one while with the lie, another while for his fear and cowardice (as who was
run away out of the bat tail) fell upon his own sword at OTHOES feet. At
which sight, he cried out alowd and said, That he would no more cast so brave
men and of so good desert into danger. Having exhorted therefore his own
brother, his brothers son and every one of his friends severally, to make
what shift they could for themselves, after he had embraced and kissed them
each one, he sent them all away: And retyring himself into a secret rowm, two
letters he wrote full of consolation unto his sister, as also to MESSALLINA,

he burnt them al, because they should breed no man any danger loss, or

about him, he dealt money to his domestical sewitours.

his end, for very grief of heart ran with their weapons one at another to

he was dead highly praised him: so as it came to be a common and rise speech
abroad. That GALBA was by him slain; not so much for that ^e affected to be

some write this, others that; and all as contrary as may be: reporting it
partly to be ancient and noble; and in part now start up and obscure, yea and
very base and beggarly. Which I would suppose to have happened by means of the
flatterers and backbiters both, of VITELLIUS the Emperor: but that I see there
is sometime variance and diversity about the very condition of that family. A
little book there is extant of one ( a) Q. EULOGIUS * Extat Q. E^logij, etc.

worshipped for a Goddess) reigned over all Latium: That the offspring
remaining of them, remooved out of the Sabines Country to Rome, and were taken

his father endeavored always what he could, that no Province whiles he lived
should be committed unto him: and his mother what time he was both sent unto
the Legions and saluted Or Emperor
Lord General, straight-waies lamented as if then he had been undone for
ever. His childhood and flower of youth he spent at Capreae among the
Strumpets and Catamites that TIBERIUS kept there: Himself noted always with
the surname of A deviser of new fashions and forms of filthy uncleanness
SPINTRIA, was thought also by suffering the abuse of his own body to have
been the cause of his fathers rising and advauncement.

4 All the time also of his age ensuing stained as he was with all manner of
reproachable villainies, so he carried a principal sway above others in the
Court, grown into familiar acquaintance with CAIUS for his love to chariot
running, and with CLAUDIUS for his affection to dice-play: but in greater
favor he was a good deal with NERO, both in the self same regards
aforesaid, as also for this especial demerite, in that being president at the
solemnity called Neroneum, when NERO was desirous to strive for the prise among
the Harpers and Musicians, but yet durst not promise so to do, (notwithstanding
all the people called instantly upon him) and thereupon went out of the
Theater: he pretending that he was sent Ambassador unto him from the people
persisting still in their earnest request, had called him back and so brought
him in the end to be entreated.

5 Through the favorable indulgence therefore of three Emperors, being
advaunced not only to right honorable offices of State, but also to as high
Sacerdotall dignities, he managed after all these the Proconsulate of Africa,
and executed the charge of surveying and supravising the public works: but
with mind and reputation both, far unlike. For in his Province he demeaned
himself for two years together with singular innocence and integrity; as who
after his brother succeeded in his stead, stayed there still in quality of his
Lieutenant. But in his office within the City, he was reported to have
secretly stolen away, the oblations, gifts and ornaments of the Temples; to
have embecilled and changed some of them; yea, and in lieu of gold and silver
to have foisted in Tinn and Copper.

6 He took to wife PETRONIA the daughter of one that had been Consul, by
whom he had a son with one eye named PETRONIANUS, Him being by his Deceased:
mother ordained her heir upon condition that he were freed once out of his
fathers power, he manumised in deed: but soon after (as it was thought)
killed: having charged him besides with parricidie, and pretending withal,
that the poison which was provided to work that mischief; he upon remorse of
conscience had drunk himself. After this, bewedded GALERIA FUNDANA, whose
father had been Pretour: and of her body also begat children of both sexes:
but the male child had such an impediment of stutting and stammering, that
little better he was than dumb and tonguelesse.

professed plainly, that none were less to be feared than those who thou^ht of
nothing but their victuals only, and that his greedy appetite and hungry belly
might be satisfied and filled with the plenteous store that the Province A, V,
C. 821
did yield. So that evident it was to every man, that he chose him in contempt
rather, than upon any special grace. This is for certain known, that when he
was to go forth, he wanted provision for his journey by the way; and for the
maintenance of his family was driven to those hard shifts and extremities, that

and took from his mothers ear a pearl, which he laid to gage: and all for to
defray the charges of that voyage. As for a number verily of his Creditours,
who waited for him as ready to stay his passage: and among them, the
Sinuessanes and Formains, whose public imposts, tollage, and revenewes he had
intercepted and converted to his own use, he could not be rid of; but by
terrifying them with an action of the case: serving one of them, and namely a
Libertine (who very eagerly demanded a debt) with process upon an action of
battery, as if he had stricken him with his heel; and would not withdraw the
suit before he had extorted from him fifty thousand Sesterces. In his coming
toward the Camp, the army maliciously bent against the Emperor, and ready to
intertaine any revolt and change of State, willingly and with open arms
received him, as a gift of the Gods presented unto them from heaven above; the
son of one thrice Consul; a man in the vigor and strength of his years; of
a gentle disposition besides, and of a frank and prodigal heart. Which opinion
and persuasion, being of old conceived and settled in men's heads, VITELLIUS had
augmented by some fresh proofs lately given of himself: kissing all the way
as he went along every mean common Soldier that he met: so courteous and
affable above all measure, to the very mulitiers and wayfaring passengers, in
every Inn and baiting place, that he would in a morning betimes ask them one
by one, whether they had yet broken their fast? and show unto them even by his
belching, that he had been at his breakfast already.

8 Now when he was entered once into the Camp, no suit denied he to any man:
nay, of his own accord he took off their marks of ignominy who stood in
disgrace; dispensed with those that were obnoxious to the Laws for wearing
poor and sullied garments; and forgave condemned persons their punishments.
Whereupon, before one month was fully come and gone, without all respect
either of day or time, when the very evening was now shooting in, suddenly by
the Soldiers called forth he was out of his bedchamber: and clad as he was

amazed and in great perplexity upon this adverse and ominous accident; Be of
good cheer, quoth he, it has shined fair upon us: and no other speech at
all made he unto his Soldiers: After this, when the army also of the higher
Province, consented now by this time with the other, (that armiel mean which
had revolted before from GALBA and sided with the Senate): the surname of
GERMANICUS generally offered unto him he gladly accepted; the addition of
AUGUSTUS he put off; and the style of CAESAR he utterly for ever refused.

settled the State of Germany, he divided his forces thus; sending one part

which was sent before, there happened a fortunate and luckie sign: For on the
right hand, all on a sudden flew an Eagle toward them: and when she had
fetched a compass round about the Standerds and Ensigns, hovered softly
before them as they marched on the way. Contrariwise, as himself removed and
set forward, the Statues on horseback, erected in many places for him, all at
once suddenly brake their legs and tumbled down: and the guirland of
Laurel, which most devoutly he had done about (his head) fell from it into a
running river. Within a while after, as he sat iudicially upon the Tribunal
to minister Justice at In France within the province Narbo^.
Vienna, a Cock first settled upon his shoulder, and anon perched upon his
very head. Upon which prodigious sights, ensued an event correspondent thereto.
For the Empire which by his Lieutenants was confirmed and established unto him,
he by himself was not able to hold.

Marshals hands. As for those hundred and twenty, whose Supplications exhibited
unto OTHO he had found, such I mean as claimed rewards for their good service
in killing GALBA, he gave commandment they should be sought out and executed
every one. A worthy beginning I assure you, and a magnificent: such as might
give good hope of an excellent Prince, had he not menaged all matters else,
according to his own natural disposition and the course of his former life,
rather than respecting the majesty of an Emperor. For no sooner put he
himself in his journey, but he rode through the midst of Cities in Triumphant
wise: and passed along the great rivers in most delicate barges, garnished and
adorned with Coronets of sundry sorts: Fating at his table most sumptuously and
served with all manner of dainty Viands: observing no discipline either of
household servitour or of Soldier: but turning the outrages, villainies and
licentious prankes of them all to aiest: who, not content with their ordinary
diet allowed and provided for them in every place where they came at the common
charges of the State; look what slaves or Aliens it pleased them, they
manumised and made free: but paid as many as withstoode them with whipping

corruption of the dead bodies, he stuck not to harten and encourage them with
this cursed speech: That an Enemy slain had a very good smell, but a Citizen
far better. Howbeit to qualify and allay the strong savor and sent that
they cast, he poured down his throat before them all, exceeding great store
of strong wine, and dealt the same plentifully about, Some conclude ye former

Thus neglecting more and more from time to time, all Law of God and man, upon
the very disasterous day ( a) Alliensis, he was enstalled in the Sacerdotall
dignity of High Priest. He ordained, that the solemn assembly Or among the
Standards and other Ensigns inter sig^a et Bexilla,
for Election of Magistrates should be held every tenth year; and himself be
perpetual dictatour. And to the end that no man might doubt what pattern he
chose to follow for government of Commonweal, calling a freqvent number of
the public Priests about him in the middle of Mars field, he sacrificed to
the Spirit and ghost of NERO: and at a solemn feast openly put the Harper in

the golden Ring: notwithstanding that the very morning before, when all the
soldiers entreated in his hehalfe, he detested so foul a blot to disteine and
discredit the worshipful degree of knighthood.

own to devour much, but also as greedy a stomach to feed both unseasonably
and also grossly of what ever came next hand, he could not so much as at any
sacrifice whenever, or in any iourny wheresoever forbear but among the
altars snatch up by and by the flesh, the parched corn also and meal even
from the very hearth, and eat the same: yea and at every victualling house by
the way side, fall to viands piping hot, yet reaking and not cooled one jot;
and not spare so much as meats dressed the day before and half eaten already.

was pretended; Noble men, his school fellows, and play-feeres in times past,
(whom by all fair means and flattering allurements he had enticed and drawn to
the society as it were of the Empire with him) by sundry sorts of fraud and
treachery, he killed and one above the rest he made away with poison, which he

demanded of him either at Rome debt, or by the way as he travailed toll and

him for his clemency, he commanded the said party to be killed before his

another, he caused two of his sons to bear him company; for nothing in the
world, but because they presumed to entreat for their fathers life. There was
besides a gentleman of Rome who being haled away to take his death, cried alowd
unto him* sir I have made you my heir. Him he compelled to bring forth the

only their discharge from service after victory, but also the availes and
fees due unto old soldiers for serving out their full time, But afterward,
as the enemy came hotely upon him both by land and sea, on the one side he
opposed his brother with the fleet and young untrained soldiers, together
with a crewe of sword fencers; on the other, what forces he had about
Bebriacum and the Captains there: And in every place, being their disco^fited
in open field or privily betrayed, he capitulated and covenanted with FLAVIVS

100. millians of sesterces. And forthwith upon the very stairs of the Palace
professing openly before a frequent assembly of his soldiers; how willing he
was to resign up that imperial dignity which he had received against his
will, when they all gain said it, he put of the matter for that instant; and
but one night beetweene, even the next morning by break of day, he came down
in poor and simple array to the Rostra; where, with many a tear, he recited
the same words out of a little written skrow. Now, as the soldiers and people
both, interrupted him a second time and exhorted him not to cast down his
heart, promising also with their utmost endeavor, and striving a vie who
should do best to assist him* he took courage again and plucked up his
spirits: So that now Nihil iam metuen^, some read metuentes, to this sense,

that he not only retained still the blade with him, but also accepted the

that family. I cannot deny, that some have given out, how the father of that

find (make what search I could) any sign or trace to lead me thereto.

2 The Empe rour.
VESPASIAN was borne in the Sabines territory beyond Reate within a small
village named Phalacrine, the fifteenth day before the 17, th Of November,
Calends of December, in the evening, when Q. CAMERINVS and CAIUS POPPAEVS
SABINVS were consuls: five years before that AUGUSTUS departed out of this
world. His bringing up he had under TERTVLLA his grandmother by the fathers
side, in the land and living that she had about Cosa. Whereupon, when he was
Emperor he both frequented continually the place of his birth and breeding,
the Capital house and manor remaining still as it had been in former times,
nothing altered (because forsooth, his eyes should have no loss nor miss of
that which they were wont to see there) and loved also the memorial of his
grandmother so dearly, that on all solemn and festival, and high days, he
continued ever drinking out of a silver pot that was hers and out of none
other. After he had put on his In 17 th year of his age,
virile gown, he refused a long time the ( a) Senators robe, although his
brother had attained thereto: neither could he be forced to seek for it at last
but by his own mother. She in the end wrought perforce so much from him, by
way of reprochful taunts more than by fair entreaty or reverent authority:
whiles, ever and anon, she called him in taunting wise, his brothers huisher.
He served as Tribune military in Thra cia: and in quality of Questor had the
government of Crete and Cyrene, provinces by lot fallen unto him. When he sued
to be Aedile, and afterward Pretour he hard ly attained to the former Offices
(and not without some repulse) even in the sixth place: but presently at his
first suit and with the foremost being chosen Pretour, and upon displeasure
taken, maliciously affected against the Senate; because he would by all manner
of demerite win the favor of CAIUS the Emperor, he earnestly demanded
extraordinary plays and games in honor of him for his victory in Germany. and
gave opinion in the Senate house, that to augment the punishment of certain
conspiratours (against him), their dead bodies should be cast forth and left
unburied. He gave him also solemn thanks before that right honorable degree,
for vouchsafing him the honor to be a guest of his at a supper.

Amid these occurrents, he espoused FLAVIA DOMITILLA, the freed woman 3
of STATILIUS CAP^LLA, a Roman gentleman of Sabraca, and an Africane borne,
committed unto him sometime upon trust, and enfranchised in the freedom of
Latium: but afterward pronounced a gentlewoman born and naturalized a Citizen
of Rome, in the Court of Judges delegate, upon claim made by her father
FLAVIUS LIBERALIS borne at Ferentinum, (a man that never rose higher than to be
a Of nota^,
Scribe to a Questour) who vouched her freedom. By her he had issew, TITUS
DAMITIANUS, and DOMITILLA. His wife and daughter he overlived, and buried them
whiles he was yet in State of a private person. After his foresaid wives

freed-woman of ANTONIA, and her Or Keeper of her books and accounts.

Under the Emperor CLAUDIUS, by especial favor of NARCISSUS, 4
sent he was into Germany as Lieutenant of a legion: from thence being removed
into Britain, he fought thirty battles with the enemy: Two most mighty
nations, and above twenty towns, together with the Isle of Wight lying next to
the said Britain, he subdued, under the conduct partly of A. PLAUTIUS

acts he received trivmphall ornaments, and in short space two sacerdotall
dignities with a consulship besides which he bare the two last months of the
year. For the middle time between, even until he was Proconsul, he led a
private life in a retyring place out of the way, for fear of AGRIPPINA, who as
yet bare a great stroke with her NERO*
son, and hated to the heart all the friends of NARCISSUS, although deceased.

obtained a Senators dignity even against his own fathers will, For which he
had a sore rebuke. Whiles he travailed through Achaia in the train and inward
company of NERO, he incurred his heavy displeasure in the highest degree, for
that whiles he was chaunting, either he made many starts away out of the place,
or else slept, if he stayed there still. And being forbidden not only to
converse in the same lodging with him, but also to salute him publicly with
others, he withdrew himself aside into a small city, and which stood out of

forming immediately at his first coming the discipline of the camp, and giving
the charge in one or two battles with such resolution, as that in the assault
of a castle, he caught a rap with a stone upon his knee, and received in his
targuete some shot of arrows.

5 After NERO and GALEA, whiles OTHO and VITELLIUS strove for Soveraintie, he
had good hope of the Empire, conceived long before, by these presaging tokens
(which I will now relate) within a country ferme by the City side, belonging
to the Flavij, there stood an old Oak consecrated unto MARS, which at 3.
childbirths of VESPASIA suddenly did put forth every time a several bough from
the stock: undoubted signs fore-shewing the destiny and fortune of each one.
The first was small and slender, which quickly withered (and therefore the
girl at that time borne lived not one year to an end): the second grew very
stiff and long withal, which pretended great felicity: but the third, came
to the bigness of a tree. Whereupon SABINUS the father (of VESPASIAN) being
confirmed beside by the answer of a One of these that pry into beasts bowels

CAESAR: Whereat, she did nothing else but set up a laughter, meruailing that
her son should have a cracked brain and fall a doting now, since that his
Mother had her wits still whole and sound: Soon after, when CAIUS CAESAR,
offended and angry with him, for that being Aedile he had not been careful
about sweeping and clensing the streets, had commanded he should be all
bedawbed with mire that the Soldiers gathered up and threw into the lap of
his embrodred robe, some were ready to make this interpretation thereof, that
the common weal trodden one day under foot and forlorn by some civil
troubles, should fall into his protection and as it were into his boso^e. As
he was at his dinner upon a time, a strange dog brought into his dining room
a man's hand and laid it under the boarde. Again, as he sat another time at
supper, an Ox having been at plough and shaken of his yoke, rushed into the
parlour where he was at meat: and when he had driven the waiters and
seruitours out, as if all on a sudden he had been weary, laid him down
along at his feet where he sat, and gently put his neck under him. A
Cypress tree likewise in his Grandfathers land without any force of tempest
plucked up by the root and laid along, the very next day following rose up
again greener and stronger than before. But in ACHAIA he dreamed, That he
and his, should begin to prosper so soon as NERO had a tooth drawn out of
his head. Now it fortuned, that the morrow following, a Surgeon that came
forth into the court-yeard showed unto him a tooth of NEROES newly drawn. In
Jury, when he consulted with the Oracle of the good ( a) CARMELUS, the
answer which was given, assured him in these terms, That whatsoever he
thought upon and cast in his mind (were it never so great) it should so come
to pass: And one of the Noble men of that Country taken captive, named Who
wrote the Jewish history.
JOSEPHUS, when he was cast into prison, avouched and said unto him most
constantly, that he should shortly be set at liberty even by him, but he
should be Emperor first. There were moreover significant tokens presaging no
less reported unto him out of the very City of Rome: and namely, that NERO in
his latter days, a little before his death, was warned in a dream to take the
sacred Chariot of JUPITER Optimus Maximus forth of the Chapel where it stood,
into VESPASIANS house, and so from Inde in Circum
thence into the Cirque. Also, not long after, as GALBA held the solemn
election for Vespasians.
his second Consulship, the statue of JULIUS, late CAESAR of famous memory,
turned of it self into the ( b) East. And at the field fought before
Bebriacum, ere the battles joined, two Aegles had a conflict and bickered
together in all their sights: and when the one of them was foiled and overcome,
a third came at the very instant from the sun rising and chased the Victresse
away.

6 Yet for all this attempted he no enterprise (notwithstanding his friends and
soldiers were most pressed and forward yea and urgent upon him) before that he
was solicited by the unexpected favor, of some, who as it fell out were both
unknowen to him and also absent. Two thousand drawn out of the three legions
of the Maesian army and sent to aid OTHO, when they were upon the way
marching (albeit news came unto them that he was vanquished and had laid
violent hands upon himself,) held on their journey nevertheless as far as
to Aquileia; as giving small credit to that rumor: where after they had by
vantage of opportunities offered, and uncontrolled liberty, committed all
manner of robberies and outrageous villainies, fearing least if they returned
back again, they should answer for their misdemeanors, and abide condign
punishment therefore; laid their heads together, and consulted about the
choosing and creating of an EMPEROVR. For, worse they took not themselves nor
inferior, either to the army in SPAIN that had set up GALBA: or to the
Pretorian bands, which had made OTHO: or to the Germanician forces who had
elected VITELLIUS, Emperors. Having purposed therefore and nominated of the
Consular Lieutenants as many, as they could in any place think upon: when
they misliked all the rest, taking exceptions against one for this cause and
another for that: Whiles some again of that third Legion, which a little
before the death of NERO had been translated out of SYRIA into MESIA, highly
praised and extolled VESPASIAN; they all accorded thereto, and without delay,
wrote his name upon their flagges and banners. And verily, for that time this
project was smuddred, the companies for a while reclaimed, and all brought into
good order. But when the said fact was once divulged: TIBERIUS ALEXANDER Or

beginning of his Empire. After them, the army in Jury took the same oath
before VESPASIAN himself, the The 11 of July
fifth day before the Ides of Iulie. These enterprises were very much
farthered, by the copy of a letter that went commonly through men's hands (true
or false I wot not) of OTHO now deceased, to VESPASIAN, charging and willing
him now at the last cast, of all love to revenge his death, and wishing him
withal, to relieve the distressed state of the Commonwealth: by a rumor also
spread abroad, That VITELLIUS upon his victory meant fully to make an exchange
of the legions winter harbors: namely, to remove those that wintered in

7 VESPASIAN therefore having undertaken a civil war, and sent before him
his Capitaines and forces into Italy, pas^ed over in the mean time to
ALEXANDRIA, for to be possessed of the frontier streights and AV^NUES of
Egypt. Here when he had voided all company from him and was entered alone
into the Temple of Serapis, after he had, upon much propitious favor of that
god obtained, devoutly at length turned him self about; him thought he saw (

(as the manner is in that place. And hereupon immediately letters came unto
him, emporting thus much, that the forces of VITELLIUS were discomfited before
CREMONA: reporting besides, that himself was killed at ROME. The only thing
that he wanted; (being as one would say, a Prince unlooked for, and as yet new
come to the Empire) was Countenance, authority, and a kind as it were of
royal majesty. But even that also came on a pace (by this occasion) It
fortuned that a certain mean commoner stark blind; another likewise with a
feeble and lame leg, came both together unto him as he sat upon the tribunal,
craving that help and remedy for their infirmities which had been s^ewed
unto them by SERAPIS in their dreams: namely, Tha^ Vespasian.

strengthen the others leg, if he vouchsafed only to touch it with his
heel. Now when as he could hardly believe, that the thing any way would
find success and speed accordingly, and therefore durst not so much as put
it to the venture: at the last through the persuasion of friends, openly before
the whole assembly, he assayed both means, neither missed he of the effect.
About the same time, at Tegea in Arcadia, by the Instinct and motion of
Prophets, there were dug out of the ground in a consecrated place,
manufactures and vessels of antique work: and among the same an Image,
resembling for all the World VESPASIAN.

cassed and also chasticed very many. As for the partners with him in victory:

placed there for Ruler, a man who had been Consul. The City of ROME by reason
of old skarefires and ruins was much blemished and disfigured. He permitted
therefore any man to seize as his own all vacant plots of ground, and to
build thereupon, in case the owners and Landlords were slack in that
behalf. Him self took upon him the reedefying of the Capitol, and was the
first man that did set his hand to the ridding of the rubbish and rammell, yea
and upon his own neck carried some of it away: three thousand tables of

as, by reason that he was forbidden the Court under NERO he stood in great
fear, and was to seek what to do or whether to go? one of the gentlemen
huishers, whose office it was to admit men into the presence, in thrusting him
out, had bidden him abire Or Morbovia^ according to which phrase we say, the

ask forgiveness, he proceeded no further in heat of anger but to words
only, and to quite him with just as many and almost the very same. For, so
far was he from working the overthrowe and death of any person, upon any
suspicion or fear conceived: that when his friends admonished him to beware
of MAETIUS POMPOSIANUS, because it was generally believed that the Astrologors
had by the horoscope of his nativitie assured him to be Emperor another day,
he advanced the same METIVS to the Consulship, presuming and promising in the
man's behalf, that he would be one day mindful of this benefit and good turn
of his.

15 There is not lightly found an innocent person to have been punished, but
when he was absent and not ware thereof: or at leastwise unwilling thereto and
deceived. With HELUIDIUS PRISCUS who only had saluted him after his return
out of SYRIA, by his private name, Not Caesar nor Augustus nor Imperator
plain VESPASIAN: and being pretour in all his Edicts and Proclamations passed
him over without any honor at all, or once naming him, he was not angry and
displeased, before that he had, with his most insolent altercations made him in
manner contemptible and little better than an ordinary person. Him also,
notwithstanding he was first confined to a place and afterward commanded to
be killed, he would have given a great deal to have saved by all means
possible: as who sent certain of purpose to call back the murderers: and saved
his life he had, but that false word came back that he was dispatched
already. Otherwise he never rejoiced in the death of any but rather when
malefactors were justly punished and executed, he would weep and groan
again.

16 The only thing, for which he might worthily be blamed was covetousness.
For, not content with this, To have revived the taxes and payments omitted by
GALBA: to have laid unto them other new and heavy impositions: to have
enhaunsed also the Tributes of the provinces, yea and of some d^pled the same:
he fell openly to negotiate and deal in certain trades, which, even for a
private person were a shame to use: buying up and engrossing some commodities
for this purpose only to put the same of, afterward at an higher price.
Neither made he it straung to sell either honorable places unto suitors for
them * or absolutions and pardons, to men in trouble, whether they were
innocent or gultie it skilled not. Furthermore, it is verily thought that of
his Procuratours, if any were greedy and given to extortion more than other,
his manner was to promote such for the nonce to higher offices: to the end,
that when they were more enriched, he might soon after condemn them. And
commonly it was said, that those he used as spunges, for that he did wet them
well when they were dry, and press them hard when they were wette. Some write
that he was by nature most covetous; and that an old Neat heard upbraided him
once therewith who being at his hands denied freedom without paying for it
(which he hu^blie craved of him now invested in the Empire) cried out with a
loud voice and said, The Wolf might change his hair, but not his qualities.
Contrariwise there be again who are of opinion, that he was driven to
spoil, to pill and poll of necessity, even for extreme want both in the
common treasury and also in his own exchequer: whereof he gave some
testimony in the beginning immediately of his Empire; professing that there
was need of forty thousand Millenes to set the STATE upright again. Which
also seems to sound more near unto the truth. Because the money by him ill

liberal. The ( a) Estate and wealth of Senators he made up to the full. To
decayed men that had been Consuls, he allowed for their maintenance 500
thousand Sesterces by the year. Very many Cities throughout the World by
Earthquake or fire ruinate, he reedified better then they were before.

17 Fine wits and cunning Artisanes he set much store by, and cherished them

for all this, could he not avoid the infamous name of his former avarice.

put on his own shoes, and also apparailled and made himself ready. After
dispatch of all occurrent businesses, he took himself to ( a) gestation, and
so to rest: having one of his Concubines, lying by his side: of whom he had
appointed a great number in steed of CAENIS deceassed. From his A Secret, or

Neither was he, by report, at any time fuller of humanity, or redier to do a

THE HISTORY OF Titus Flavius Vespasianus Augustus,
written by Caius Suetonius Tranquillus.


TITUS, surnamed as his Father was, VESPASIANUS, the 1
lovely dearling and delightful joy of Mankind (so fully was he, either
endued with good nature and disposition, or enriched with skillful cunning, or
else graced with fortunes favor; and that (which is hardest of all) in his
Imperial State; considering that whiles he lived as a private person under
the Emperor his Father, he could not avoid the very hatred and much less the
reproof of the world.) This TITUS, I say, was borne the 30 of December.

for the death of CAIUS the Emperor, near unto the ( a) Septizonium, A, V, C.

within a poor ill favored house, in a very little Chamber and dark withal:
For it remains yet to be seen. His Education he had in the Court together
with BRITANNICUS, trained up in the like Arts and Disciplines, under the same
teachers. At which time verily, men say, that a Metoposcop^.

He, but TITUS who then stood hard by, should surely be Emperor. Now were
these two so familiar, that (as it is verily thought) of the same cup of poison
whereof BRITANNICUS drank and died, TITUS also sitting near unto him, tasted:
whereupon he fell into a grievous disease, that held him long and put him to
great pain. In memorial of all which premises, he erected afterward for

him one Statue of gold in the Palatium; as also another of Ivorie on
horseback (which at the Circeian Games is even at this day carried before in
the Solemn pomp) he dedicated, and accompanied accordingly.

At the very first, even in his childhood, there shone forth in him, the gifts

years: A goodly presence and countenance, wherein was seated no less

stature was not tall: but his belly bare out somewhat with the most. A singular
memory: and aptness to learn all the Arts, in manner, as well of war as of
peace. Most skillful he was in handling his weapon, and withal a passing good
horsman: For his Latin and Greek tongue, whether it were in making Orations
or composing Poemes, prompt and ready even to the performance thereof ex
tempore. Neither was he un^eene in Music as who could both sing and also play
upon instruments sweetly and with knowledge* I have heard also many men say,
That he was wont to write with Ciphers and Characters most swiftly, striving by
way of sport and mirth with his own Clerks, whether he or they could write
fastest? to express likewise and imitate what hand so ever he had seen: yea,
and to profess many a time, that he would have made a notable forger and
counterfaiter of writings.

also 3

practice. At which very time, he wedded ARRICIDIA, the daughter of TERTULLUS a
Gentleman of Rome, but Captain sometime of the P^aetorian Bands: and in the
room of her deceased, he took to wife MARTIA FLAVIA: and from her when she
had borne unto him a daughter, he divorsed himself. After this, upon his
Questureship, being Colonel and Commander of a whole A V. C. 820

of his daughter, with so great joy and favorable applause of all his
Soldiers: that in their gratulation they saluted him Emperor: and soon
after, when he was to depart out of that Province, detained him: in humble
manner, yea and ^ft-soones in threatening wise instantly calling upon him, To
stay, or else to take them all away together with him. Whereupon arose the
first suspicion, That he revolted from his father, and had attempted to
challenge the kingdom of the East parts for him self. Which surmise himself
made the more, after that in his way to Alexandrea, as he consecrated at
Memphis the Ox Apis, he wore a ( a) Diadem: Which he did in deed according to
the custom and rites of the ancient religion there. But there wanted not
some, who construed it otherwise. Making have therefore into Italy; after he
was arrived first at Rhegium and from thence at Puteoli, embarked in a
Merchants ship of burden; to Rome he goes directly with all speed and most
lightly appointed: and unto his father looking for nothing less, I am come
quoth he, father, I am come: checking thereby the rash and inconsiderate rumors
raised of him.

5 From that time forward he ceased not to carry himself as partner with his
Father, yea and Protector also of the Empire: With him he triumphed: with him
A, V, C, 824 825, 824
he jointly administered the Censureship: His Colleague he was in the Tribunes
authority: his Companion likewise in seven Consulships. And having taken to A,
V, C, 823 825. 827, 828 829, 830, 832
himself the charge well-neere of all Offices, whiles he both endited letters
and penned Edicts in his Fathers name: yea, and read Missives
Orations in Senate, and that in the Questours turn, he assumed also the
Captainship of the Guard, an Office never to that time executed but by a
Gentleman of Rome. In this place he demeaned himself nothing civilly, but
proceeded with much violence: For ever as he had any in most jealousy and
suspicion, he, by sending secretly and underhand certain of purpose, who in
the Theaters and Camp should require for to have them punished (as it were
with his Fathers consent) made no more a do but brought them all to their end.
As for example, among these, he commanded AULUS CAECINA, a man of Consular
Degree, and a guest by him invited to supper, when he was scarce gone out of
the Banqueting parlor to be stabbed. I must needs say, that driven he was to
this violent proceeding upon an extremity of danger: considering that he had
found out his handwriting bearing evidence of a conspiracy that he plotted
with the Soldiers. By which courses, as he provided well and sufficiently for
his own security another day: so, for the present time he incurred very much
displeasure and hatred of the world: In so much, as no man lightly, when so
adverse a rumor was on foot, and that which more is, against the wills of all
men, would have stepped to the Imperial throne.

6 Beside his cruelty, suspected he was also for roiotous life: in that he
continued banqueting until midnight with the most profuse and wastfull
spend-thrifts of his familiar minions: For wanto^ lust likewise, by reason of a
sort of stale Catamites and guelded Eunuchs that he kept about him: and the
affectionate love that he was noted to bear to The sister as some think of
Agrippa, and wise for a wh^e of Polemon King of Lyci^, others ^ay* she was the
wife first of Aristo^ulus after wards of A^ipater.
Queen BERENICE, unto who^ also, as it was said he promised marriage. Suspicion
there was moreover of his pilling and polling. For certain it was, that in the
(...),
co^missio^s and hearing of causes which his father held, he was wont to sell
the decision of matters, and to make a gain thereby. After this, men both
reputed and also reported him to be even another NERO. But this name that went
of him proved good for him and turned to his greatest commendation: considering
that no gross vice could be found in him, but contrariwise many excellent
virtues. The feasts that he made were pleasant meriments, rather than lavish
and sumpteous. He chose for his friends such, as in whom the Emperors also his
successors reposed themselves, and whom they used especially as necessary
members both for them and also for the Commonwealth. As for Queen BERENICE,
he sent her quickly away from the City of Rome; but full loath they were both
of them to part a sunder. Certain of his minions and dearlings whom he
favored and fansied most, albeit they were such artificial Dauncers, that
within a while after they carried the greatest praise and prise upon the stage,
he forbear quite not only to huggle and embrace long together, but to behold
so much as once in any public meeting and assembly. From no Citizen took he
ought: and from aliens goods he abstained, if ever any did. Nay, he received
not the very contributions granted and usually paid. And yet, being inferior
to none of his predecessors in munificence, as having dedicated an At which
solemnity 5000 wild beasts were killed. A^ Eusebius Chronograph^s and
Eutropi^s write

expedition, he exhibited a Spectacle of Sword-fencers, with all kinds of
furniture thereto belonging in most plentiful manner. He represented also a
navall fight in the old Naumachia; In which very place he brought forth
likewise his sword-fencers to play their prises: and in that one day he put out
to be baited 5000 wild beasts of all sorts.

7 Furthermore, being of his own nature most kind and gracious; whereas by a
constitution and order that TIBERIUS began, all the CAESAR'S his Successors
held not the Benefits granted by former Princes good and in force, unless
they also themselves made new graunts of the same again: he was the first,
that by virtue of one sole edict, ratified and confirmed all that had passed
before: neither suffered he any petition to be made unto him for them. In all
other Suits and Requests, he ever more held most constantly men's minds at
this pass, that he would send none away without hope. And when his
Domestical Ministers about his person, would seem to tell him, That he
promised more than he was able to perform: What! quoth he, there ought no man
to depart from the speech of a Prince, sad and discontented. Calling to mind
one time as he sat at supper, That he had done nothing for any man that day,
he uttered this memorable and praiseworthy Apophthegme, My friends, I have
lost a day. The people especially in general he entreated in all occasions,
with so great courtesy, that having proposed a solemn Sword-fight, he made
open profession, that he would set it forth, not to please him self but to
content the beholders. And verily, even so he did: for, neither denied he
ought to them that would call for it: and of his own accord, willed them to
ask what their minds stood to. Moreover, showing plainly, that he stood
well affected to the manner of the Thracian- Who were opposite to the
Mirmillones, y^ were armed after the french fashion.
swordfencers fight and their Armature, he would many times even with the rest
of the people both in word and gesture (as a favourer of that kind) jest and
make sport: yet so, as he kept still the majesty of an Emperor: and withal
judged with equity indifferently. And because he would pretermit no point of
popularity, sometime as he bathed in his own baines he admitted the Commons
thither unto him. There fell out in his days certain mischaunces and heavy
accidents: as, the burning of the mountain Vesaev^s in Campania: A Skar-fire
at Rome, which lasted three days and three nights; as also a Wherein there died
ten thousand a day, E^ses.
pestilence, the like whereof had not lightly been known else where at any
other time. In these calamities so many and so grievous, he showed not only a
Princely care, but also a singular fatherly affection: sometime comforting (his
people) by his Edicts; otherwhiles helping them so far forth as his power
would extend. For repairing the losses in By the burning of Ves^ which consumed
many towns and much people.
Campania, he chose by lot certain Commissioners to look thereto* even out of
the rank of those that had been Consuls. The goods of such as perished in the
said mount, whose heirs could not be found, he awarded to the reedification
of the ruinate Cities adjoining. And having made public protestation, that in
the said skare-fire of the City, there was no loss at all but to himself:
Look what ornaments were in any of his own In the Country, as Columns,
statues painted tables* etc.
Palaces and royal houses, the same he appointed to the City buildings and
the Temples: For which purpose he made diverse of Knights degree Supravisors,
to the end that every thing might be dispatched with greater expedition. To
cure the sickness and mitigate the fury of those contagious Diseases, he
used all help of god and man; having sought out what soever kinds of
Sacrifices and remedies might be found: Among the adversities of those times,
may be reckoned these Promoters and Informers, with such as under hand set
them a work, occasioned all by old licentiousness and impunitie. And those he
commanded to be whipped and beaten with cudgels ordinarily in the open Market
place: and last of all, when they had been brought in a Show through the
Amphitheatre, partly to be sold in port-sale for slaves: and in part to be
carried away into the roughest and bleakest Islands that were. And because he
would for ever restrain such, as at any time should dare to do the like: he
made an Act among many others, prohibiting* One and the same matter to be
sued by virtue of many Statutes and Laws enacted in that behalf; or to make
inquisition as touching the estate of any man deceased, after the term of
certain years limited.

8 Having professed, that he took upon him the High Priesthood in this regard,
because he would keep his hands pure and innocent, he made good his word.
For, after that time, never was he the principal Author of any man's death,
nor privy and accessarie thereto; (albeit he wanted not sometimes just cause
of revenge) but swear devoutly, That he would rather die himself, than do^
others to death. Two noble men of the Patritian rank, convicted for affecting
and aspiring to the Empire he proceeded against* no farther than to admonish
them to desist and give over, saying, That Sovereign power was the gift of
Destiny and Divine providence. If they were Petitioners for any thing else, he
promised to give it unto them. And verily; out of hand, to the mother of the
one* who was then far of (woeful and pensive woman as she was) he dispatched
his own coursitours and foote-men to carry word that her son was safe: As
for themselves he not only invited them to a familiar and friendly supper
that night: but also the next day following, at the sight of Sworde-fencers
placing them of purpose near about his own person, the As their armor,

could never endure either to kill or to sequester and confine, no nor so much
as to abridge of any honor: but, as he had always done from the first day of
his imperial dignity, persevered to testify and declare, that Partner he was
with him in the Sovereign government, and his heir apparent to succeed him:
otherwhiles secretly with tears and prayers beseeching, That he would
vouchsafe him yet at length, mutual love and affection

9 Amid this blessed course of life, cut short he was and prevented by death,
to the greater loss of mankind than of himself. After he had finished the
solemn Shows and Games exhibited to the people, in the end and upshot
whereof, he had shed tears abundantly: he went toward the Sabines territory
somewhat more sad than usually he had been: by occasion, that as he
sacrificed, the beast brake loose and gat away: as also because in fair and
clear weather ( a) it had thundered. Hereupon, having gotten an ague at his
first lodging and baiting place, when he was removing from thence in his
Licter, it is said that putting by the Curtains of the window, he looked up
to heaven, and complained very piteously, that his life should be taken from
him who had not deserved to die: For there was no fact of his extant, of which
he was to repent, save only one. Now what that one should be, neither uttered
he himself at that instant, neither is any man able readily to guess thereat.
Some think, he called to mind the over-familiar acquaintance that he had with
his brothers Domitia
wife. But DOMITIA devoutly swear, That he never had such dealing with her: who
no doubt would not have denied it, if there had been any folly at all between
them: nay, she would rather have made her vaunt thereof: so ordinary a thing
it was with her to glory in all naughtiness and shameful deeds.

10 He departed ( a) this world, in the very same Country House wherein his
father died before him: upon the 13 of September.
Ides of September, two years, two months and twenty days after that he
succeeded his father, and in the two and fortieth year of his age. Which being
once notified and known abroad, when all men throughout the A, V, C. 834
City mourned no less than in some domestical occasion of Sorrow and
Lamentation: The Senate before they were summoned and called together by any
Edict, ran to the Curia, finding as yet the doors fast locked: but when they
were set open, they rendered unto him now dead so much thanks, and heaped upon
him so great a measure of praises, as they never did before, at any time,
whiles he was living and present among them.

In the Vitellian troubles he fled into the Capitol with his Vn^le SABINVS, and
part of the forces which were then present. But when the adverse faction brake
in: and while the Temple was on fire; he lay close all night in the Sextaines
lodging and early in the morning disguised in the habit of a priest of Isis,
and among the sacrificers belonging to that vain superstition, after he had
passed over Tiberis accompanied with one only person, to the mother of a
school fellow of his, he lurked there so secretly, that a beit the serehers
traced him by his sooting yet could he not be found. At last after victory
obtained he went forth and showed himself; and being generally saluted by
the name The Empe* rours son and heir apparent of the Empire.

authority, he took upon him in name and title only: the jurisdiction
whereof he made over to his next Colleague. But in all power of As being a

Lordly rule, he carried himself so licentiously and without controlment that
he showed even then betimes, what a one he would prove hereafter. And not to
handle every particular. having with unclean hands offered dishonor to many
men's wives, he fled a way and married also DOMITIA LONGINA the wedded wife of
AELIUS LONGINVS: and in one day gave and dealt above twenty offices, within
the City and abroad in foraine provinces: in so much as VESPASIAN commonly
said, That he marvailed, why (...) sent not one also to succeed in his place.

2 He enterprised moreover a voyage into Gaul and Germany, Notwithstanding
the same was needless, and his fathers friends diswaded him from it; only,
because he would equallize his brother both in Operibus. i. deeds and exploits.
works and reputation. For these prankes of his rebuked he was: and to the end
he might the rather be put in mind of his young years and private condition,
he dwelt together with his father: in a licter he attended the (Curule)
chair of father and brother, whenever they went forth of doors: and being
mounted upon a white Courser accompanied them both, in their triumph over

ordinary; and the same by occasion that his brother TITUS yielded unto him his
own place and furthered him in his suite. Himself likewise made wonderful
sembla^ce of modesty. But above all, he seemed outwardly to affect Poetry,
(a study which he was not so much unacquainted with before time, but he
despised and rejected it as much afterward) and recited his own verses even
in public place. Yet never the less, when VOLOGESVS King of the Parthians
required aid against the Alanes, and one of VESPASIANS two sons to be the
General of those forces, he labou red with might and maine, that himself
before all others should be sent: and because the quarrel was Peace con cluded
between the a, nations
dispatched already to his hand, he assaied by gifts and large promises to
solicit other Kings of the East, to make the same request. When his father
was dead, standing in doubtful terms with himself a long time, whether he
should offer unto the soldiers a donative duple to that of his brother TITUS,
he never stuck to give out and make his boast, That left he was to be
partner with him in the Empire, but that his fathers will was very much
abused. Neither would he give over from that time forward both to-lay wait
secretly for his brother, and also to practice openly against him, until such
time as he gave commandment when he was stricken with grievous sickness,
that he should be left for dead before the breath was out of his body: and
after he was departed indeed, vouchsafing him no other honor but his
Canonization for a God.
consecration, he carped also at him many a time as well in glauncing
figurative speeches as in open Edicts.

3 In the beginning of his Empire his manner was, to retire himself daily into
a secret place for Horarium or for a certain time of the day: some say three
hours.
one hour, and there to do nothing else but to catch flies, and with the sharp
point of a bodkin or writing steel prick the^ through: In so much, as when
one enquired, whether any body were with CAESAR within? VIEIVS CRISPVS made
answer not impertinently, no, not so much as a fly. After this, DOMITIA his
own wife, who in his second Consulship had borne him a son, and whom two
years after he had saluted as Empress, by the name of AUGUSTA, her I say,
falling in fancy with PARIS the stage player and ready to die for his love,
he put away: but within a small while after (as impatient of this breach and
divorse) took her home, and married her again, as if the people had instantly
called upon him so to do. In the administration of the Empire he behaved him
self for a good while variablie, as one made of an equal mixture and temper
of vices and virtues, until at length he turned his virtues also into vices:
being, (so far as we may conjecture) over and above his natural inclination,
for want coverous and greedy; for fear bloody and cruel.

4 He exhibited ordinarily magnificent and sumpteous shows not only in the
Amphitheatre, but in the Cirque also. In which, beside the usual running of
Chariots, drawn as well with two steedes as four. He represented likewise
two battles of horsemen and foot men both: and in the Amphitheatre a Navall
fight. For, baitings of wild beasts, and sword fencers, he showed in the very
night by cresset and torch lights; and he brought into the place not men only
to fight, but women also to encounter wild beasts. Furthermore, at the games of
swordfight set out by the Questours (which having in times past been
discontinued and forlet, he brought into use again) he was always present
in person, so as he gave the people leave to choose two pair of swordfencers
out of his own school, and those he brought in, royally, and courth^e
appointed in the last place. And at all sights of sword players, there stood
ever at his feet a little dwarf arraied in skarlet with a small head that it
was wonderful: with whom he used to talk and confer otherwhiles of
serious matters. Certes, over heard he was, when he demanded him of what he
knew? and what he thought, of the last dispose of the Provinces? and namely of
ordaining METIUS RVFUS Lieutenant general of Egypt? He exhibited navall
battles performed in manner, by full fleetes and complete navies: having
dug out a great pit for a lake, and built a stone wall round about it, near
unto Tiberis: and those he would be hold in the greatest storms and showers *

that were. He set forth also the Secular plays and games making his
computatio^ from the year, not where in CLAUDIUS, but AUGUSTUS long before
had made them. During these, upon the day of the Circentia^ solemnities, to
the end there might be an hundred Missus. every of which ordinarily confists of

courses the sooner run, he abridged the races of every one, to wit, from 7.
to 4. He ordained moreover, in the honor of IVPITER CAPITOLINVS, Quinquennall
Games of three fold Maisteries, music, horseriding, and Gymnicke exercises:
and in the same, rewarding victours with Coroners, more by a good many then now
they be. Herein the concurrents strove also for the prise in Prose, both Greek
and Latin: and besides single harpers, there were Setts of those also that
played upon the harp, yea and consorts of such as sung thereto, in a quire. In
the running place, Virgins also ran for the best games. At all these masteries
and solemnities, he sat as president in his Pantofles, clad in a robe ( a) * Or

of purple after the Greekish fashion, wearing on his head a golden Coronet;
with the Image of JUPITER IVNO and MINERVA: having the priest of JUPITER and
the College of the religious, called FLAVIALES, sitting by him in like habit;
saving that in their Coronets there was his Image also. Semblably, he
celebrated every year upon the Albane mount, the Quin quatria of MINERVA. In
whose honor he had instituted a Society, out of which there should be chosen
by lot, Masters and Wardens of that solemnity who were to exhibit peculier
and especial Beastbaitings and stage plays, yea and contentions for the
prise, of Orators and Poets besides. He gave a Congiarium
largess to the people thrice: to wit, three hundred sesterces a piece: and at
the Xiphilin
show of the swordfight a most plenteous dinner. At the solemn So, Called of

to encounter. Of the stone that was about which, the greatest Cirque of al was
afterward built, by occasion that both sides thereof had been burnt down.

6 Expeditions he made, some voluntary; some upon necessity. Of his own
accord that against the Catti: upon constreint one, against the Sarmatians; By
occasion that one whole Legion together with their Lieutenant fell upon the
sword: two against the Daci, the former, because OPPIUS SABINVS a man of
Consuls degree was defaited and slain; and the second, for that CORNELIUS
FVSCVS, Captain of the Praetorian bands (unto whom he had com mitted the
whole conduct of that war) lost his life. Over the Catti and Daci (after sundry
feilds fought with variety of fortune) he triumphed twice. For his victo ry of
the Sarmatians, he presented only IVPITER CAPITOLINVS with his Laurel
guirland. The civil war stirred up by LUCIUS ANTONIUS governer of the higher
Germany, he dispatched and ended By N^rbanus Appius who ^lew the said (...).
in his absence: and that by a wonderful good hap: when, as at the very hour
of conflict, the Rhene swelling and overflowing suddenly stayed the Barbarians
forces as they would have passed over to ANTONIUS. Of which victory he had
intelligence by pre^ages, before the news by messengers came. For upon that
very day when the battle was fought, an Eagle after a straung manner having
overspred his statue at Rome and clasped it about with her wings, made a great
flapping noise in token of much joy; and within a little after, the bruit was
blown abroad so rife and common, of ANTONIES death, that many avouched
confidently, they had seen his head also brought home (to Rome,)

7 Many new orders besides in matters of common use, he brought uppe. The dole
of Viands given and distributed in little baskets in lieu of a public supper,
he abolished: and reduced the ancient custom of* complete and formal
suppers: Unto the * 4 factions in former time, of several crewes running with

Circean games, he added twain; to wit the golden and purple live^y. Players

immoderate care employed upon Vineyards, tillage was neglected he made an
Edict, That no man in all Italy should plant any new young Vineyardes: and
that in ( a) foraine Provinces they should cut them all down reserving at the
most but the one half. Howbeit, he continued not in the full execution of
this Act: Some of the greatest offices he communicated indifferently between
Libertines and soldiers. He prohibited, that there should be two Geminari

Camps of the ( b) legions. Item that any man should lay up more than a

bestowed in stock. He added a fourth stipend also for soldiers, to wit, 3.

pieces of gold by the poll.

8 In ministering justice precise he was and industrious. Many a time, even in
the common place, sitting extraordinarily upon the Tribunal he reversed the
definitive sentences of the Centumuirs, given for favor and obtained by
flattery. He warned eft^oones the commissioners and Judges delegate, not to
accommodate themselves and give ear unto persuasive and Rhetorical Of such
bond men, as against their Lorde^ and Masters Right claimed freedom and used

Assertions. The judges that were bribed and cor rupted with money he noted
and disgraced every one, together with their Assessours upon the bench. He
moved also and persuaded the Tribunes of the Commons to accuse Iudicially for
extortion, and to force unto restitution, a base and corrupt who by taking
^oney exercised his office otherwise the be ought.
Aedile: yea and to call unto the Senate, for to have a Jury ^mpannelled upon
him. Moreover, so careful was he to chastise as well the magistrates within
Rome as the Rulers of Provinces abroad of their misdemeanors that never at any
time they were either more temperate or just in their places. The most part of
whom after his days, we our selves have seen culpable, yea and brought into
question for all manner of crimes. Having taken upon him the censuring and
reformation of manners, he inhibited that licentious liberty taken up in
Theaters, of beholding the plays and games pell-mell one with another in the
quarter and ranks appointed for gentlemen. Diffamatorie libels written and
divulged, wherein men and women of good mark were touched and taxed, he
abolished not with out shame and ignominy of the Authors. A man of Questours
degree; because he took pleasure in Pu^pet-like gesturing and dancing, he
remooved out of the Senate. From women of dishonest carriage, he took away the
privilege and use of their Licters: he made them incapable also of Legacies
and inheritances. A gentleman of Rome he rased out of the Roll and Tables of
Judges, for receiving his wife again into Wedlock, whom he had before put
away and sued in an action of adultery. Some of both degrees, as well
Senators as Gentlemen, he condemned, by virtue of the law Against the filthy
sin of Paederastie or Sodomie.

called into question again and convicted, should be buried quick: and the

Comitium: except on alone a man of Praetours degree; unto whom whiles the
matter remained yet doubtful, and because he had confessed and bewraied
himself (upon his examination by torture which was uncertain) he granted the
favor of Exile. And that no religious service of the Gods should be
contaminated and polluted without condign punishment, the monument or Tomb,
which his freedman had built for a son of his with the stones appointed for
the Temple of JUPITER CAPITOLINVS, he caused his soldiers to demolish: and
the bones and relics therein he drowned in the Sea.

9 At the first he abhorred all bloodshed and slaughter, so far forth, as
that (while his father was yet absent) calling to rememoraunce this Verse of
Virgil.

to the last word ( Ante,) in the verse pr^cedent.

He purposed fully to publish an Edict, Forbiddiuge to kill and sacrifice any
Ox. Of Cupiditatis quoque atque avarit^ By cove tousnesse he means the
greedy de^re of other men's goods: by avarice, in this place the pinch ing
expense of his own.
Covetousness also and avarice, he gave scarcely the least suspicion; either
at any time when he led a private life, or a good while after he was
Emperor: but contrariwise rather, he showed great proufes oftentimes, not of
abstine^ce only but also of liberality. And whenever he had bestowed gifts
most bountifully upon those that were about him, he laid upon them no charge
before this nor with more earnestness, than to do nothing basely and beggarly.
Moreover, one Legacy put down in the last Will of RVSCIUS CAEPIO who had
provided therein. That his ^eire should give yearly unto every one of the
Senators, as they went into the Caria, a certain sum of money, he made
void. Al those likewise, whose suits had hung and depended in the Chamber of
the City, from before five years last past, he discharged and delivered from
trouble. Neither suffered he them to be sued and molested again, but within
the compass of one year and with this condition, that the accuser (unless
he overthrew his Plaintiff.
adversary by that time) should be banished for his labor. The Scribes and
Notaries beelonging to the * Defendant.
Questours, who by an old custom, (but yet against the Law Clodia) used to
negotiate and trade, he pardoned only for the time past. The (...) ends and

Exchequer he repressed: and sharply punished such Informers. And this (by men's
saying) was a speech of his, The Prince that chastneth not Promoters, sets
them on to promote.

10 But long continued he not in this ^aine, either of clemency or of
abstinence. And yet fell he somewhat sooner to cruelty than to cove^ousnesse.
A Scholar of the cunning player and counterfeit Paris, being as yet of tender
years, and at that time very sick, he murdered: for that, both in skill and

friends and freed men that were most inward with him; who together with his
wife conspired his death. The last year and day of his life, the very hour
also and what kind of death he should die, he had long time before suspected.
For when he was but a youth, the Chaldaean Astrologers had fore-tolde him all.
His Father also one time at supper, when he saw him forbear to eat
Mushromes, laughed him to scorn as ignorant of his own destiny, for that he
did not fear the sword rather. And therefore being always timorous and
stricken into his pensive dumps upon the least suspicions presented, he was
beyond all measure troubled and disquieted: In so much as it is credibly
reported, that no other cause moved him more, to dispense with that Edict which
he had proclaimed for the cutting down and destroying of Vineyards, than
certain Pamphlets and Libels scattered abroad with these verses.

In the same fearfulness he refused a new honor and that which never was
devised before, offered by the Senate unto him, (though otherwise most eager and
greedy of all such things) whereby they decreed, That so often as he was
Consul, the Gentlemen of Rome, as it fell by lot to their turns, should in
their rich and gay coats and with militare Lances march before him among the
Lictours and other Sergeants and Apparitours. When the time also of that
danger drew near which he suspected, he became perplexed every day more than
other: and therefore he garnished the walls of those galleries wherein he was
wont to rome himself and walk, with the stone Phengites; by the images
rebounding from the brightness whereof he might see before his face whatsoever
was done behind his back. The most part of prisoners and persons in duresse,
he would not hear but being alone and in a secret place, taking hold first
of their chains in his own hand. And because he would persuade his household
servitours, that no man should be so hardy as to lay violent hand upon his own
Patron to kill him, no though much good might ensue thereof; he condemned
EPAPHRODITUS the Secretary of NERO, for that it was thought, his Lord and
Master (after he was forlorn and forsaken of all) had his helping hand to
dispatch him out of the world.

To conclude, his Uncles son ( a) FLAVIUS CLEMENS (a man for his lithernesse

and negligence most contemptible) whose sons being yet very little ones, he
had openly ordained to be his Successors: and abolishing their former names,
commanded the one to be called VESPATIAN and the other DOMITIAN, he killed
suddenly, upon a slender and small suspicion, even when he was scarce out of
his Consulship. By which deed of his most of all, he hastened his own end and
destruction, For 8 months space together, so many lightnings were seen and

always the same, now in this last year, delivered one mostwofull, and not
without mention of blood. He dreamed, that ( b) MINERVA, whom he worshipped
superstitiously, departed out of her Chapel, and said, She could not protect
him any longer, for that she was by IVPITER disarmed. But with no one thing
was he so much disquieted, as with the answer of ASCLETARIO the Astrologer;
and the accident that chanced unto him thereupon. This ASCLETARIO being
informed against, and not denying that he had delivered what by his art and
learning he foresaw, he questioned with and asked, what his own end should be?
and when he made answer and affirmed, That his destiny was to be t^rne in
pieces with dogs, and that shortly after; he caused him presently to be killed
but to reprove the rashness and uncertaintie of his skill and profession, he
commanded with all, that he should be buried with as great care as possibly
might be. In the doing whereof accordingly, it fortuned that by a sudden
tempest, the corpse being cast down out of the funeral fire, the dogs tare and
rent peecemeale, when it was but half burnt and the same happened to be reported
unto him among other Fabulus narrations to make Princes merry
tales and news, of that day, as he sat at supper, by LATINVS the player and
counterfeite iester, who as he passed by, chanced to see and mark so much.

16 The day before his death, when he had given commandment that certain
Mushromes set before him should be kept against the morrow, he added moreover,
if I may have use of them and turning to those that were next him he said; The
day following it would come to pass, that the Moon should embrue her self

skared he was, that he started out of his bed. Hereuppon in the morning
betimes he gave hearing unto the Soothsayer sent out of Germany, who being
asked his opinion about the lightning, had foretold a chang in the state: and
him he condemned. And whiles he scratched very hard at a were in his forehead
which was festered and grown to be sore, seeing blood run out of it, would God
quoth he, this were all. Then asked he what was a clocke^ and insteede of the

5th. hour which he feared, word was brought for the nonce that it was the
6th. Being ioious hereupon that the danger was now past, and hastening to
cherish his body and make much of himself, PARTHENIUS his principal
Chamberlain turned him an other way; saying there was one come who brought
tidinges (I wot not what) of great co^seque^ce and of a matter in no wise to be
deferred. Voiding therefore all persons from him, he retired into his
bedchamber, and there was he murdered.

17 As touching the manner how he was forlaide and of his death, thus much (in
manner) has been divulged. Whiles the conspiratours were in question with
themselves and doubtful, when, and how, they should set upon him? that is to
say, whether he bathed or sat at supper? STEPHEN the procuratour of Whom
Eus^bius reports to have been n^ipce by the sister of Flavius Clement and a
Christian, therefore confined to the Island Ponti^.
Domitilla, and at the same time in trouble for intercepting certain moneys,
offered his advise and helping hand, who having for certain days before bound
up and enwrapped his left arm (as if it had been amiss) with wool and
swaddling bands, thereby to avert from himself all suspicion, at the very
hour interposed fraud and made a lie. For, professing that he would discover
the conspiracy, and in that regard being admitted into the chamber, as
DOMITIAN was reading of a bill which he preferred unto him, and therewith
stood amazed, he stabbed him beneth in the very share near unto his privy
parts. When he was thus wounded and began to struggle and resist; CLODIANVS
a Certain soul diers were so termed,
Co^icularius, and MAXIMUS afreed man of Parthenius, and SATVRIVS the Deane or
Decurion of the Chamberlaines with one out of his own swordfencers school,
came in upon him, gave him seven wounds, and killed him out right. A youth and
page of his, who stood by (as his wonted manner was) because he had the charge
of his bedchamber ( a) LARES, and was present at this murder committed, made
this report moreover, that DOMITIAN, at the very first wound given, immediately
bad him reach the Or rapier
dagger, that lay under his pillow, and to call in his ministers and
servitours: but at the beds head he found nothing at al thereof save the haft
only: and as for the doors besides, they were all fast shut: Also, that
DOMITIAN in this mean space, took hold of STEPHEN, bare him to the ground and
wrestled with him a long time: That he one while assaied to wrest his sword
out of his hands, another while (albeit * 17* th. of September,
his fingers were hurt and mangled) to pluck out his eyes. Well, killed he
was, the 14th day before the Kalends of October, in the 45th year of his age,
and the 15th of his Empire. His dead body was carried forth upon the common
bierre by the ordinary bearers: and PHYLLIS his nource burned it in a funeral
fire, within a country manor of his own near unto the City, situate upon
the high way Latina. But the relics thereof she bestowed in the Temple of
the FLAVIAN family, and blended the same with the ashes of IULIA the daughter
of TITUS, whom she had reared and brought up.

Of Stature he was tall, his countenance modest, and given much to ( a) rednes:
his eyes full and great, but his sight very dim. Besides, fair he was and of
come ly presence especially in his youth: well shaped all his body throughout,
excepting his feet: the toes whereof were of the Restrictiores drawn inward
shortest. In process of time, he became disfigured and blemished with
baldness, with a fat grand-panch and sclender shanks: and yet they grew to be
so lean upon occasion of a long sickness. For his modesty and shame facednesse
he so well perceived himself to be commended, that one time before the Senate
he gave out these words, Hitherto certainly ye have liked well of my mind and
of my countenance. With his bald head he was so much yrked, that he took it
as a reproach unto himself, if any man else were either in board or good earnest
twitted therewith: albeit in a certain little book, which he wrote unto a
friend of his, concerning the nourishment and preservation of the hair of the
head, he by way of consolation both to that friend and also to himself,
inserted thus much.

palm of a child's right hand, standing far of and holding it forth stretched
open for a mark, as they should all directly pass through the void spaces
beetweene the fingers, and do him no harm at all.

he took order to repair the Libraries consumed with fire, to his exceeding
great charges: making search from all parts for the copies of books lost, and
sendinge as far as to In Egypt.

Tribune military was CAESAR in this place.

( a) Caesar envying such an honor unto Catulus, as 14
to reedifie and dedicate the Capitol consumed with fire, a piece of work that
Sulla the Dictatour took in hand but finished not, and the only thing whereby
his felicity was not complete, would have put him by it and conferred it upon
another: and therefore put the matter in question, before the body of the
people, there to be discussed and debated, whether it were their mind and;

whether they were Burgesses of Free Burroughes, yeomen of the Country following

causes, they were reckoned in the number of Optimates. On the other side, as
many as aimed only at this, to please and content the multitude, were they
never so well borne or otherwise qualified, they went in the rank of
Populares; so that it seems, that Populares were the Forensis factio, that
LIVIE writes of, and whom Q. FABIVS reduced all in to the four Tribus
urban^s; and Optimates, the Tribus rustic^, wherein was (...) po^ulus, fauto^

likewise it appears, that CAESAR began his Pretorshipp.

was called in Greek (...). And not only citie-Magistrates, but Priests and
children of (...) birth used the same. Setting a side the border of purple, it
was otherwise while.

( f) By Curia simply without any adiunction, is me^t Curia Hostili^, as
witnesses Alex. ab Alexa^dr^ ^. A statly place built by ^. TVLLIVS HOSTILIVS
in the Forum Romanum, near unto the Rostra: where, as in the Parliament house
assembled the Senators ordinarily to consult upon the affairs of State. For,
other places there were, under the name of CVRIA, wherein likewise the Senate
met together, as CVRIA POMPEII, in which CAESAR was murdered, Dr^ Augusti etc.
but then they had their addition. I am not ignorant, that other CVRIEA there
were for the Pontifies and Priests. To say nothing how the people was divided
into CVRISA. id est, Parishes, and in every of them was a CVRIA, and a
superintendent or Curate called Curio.

( g) Superior Magistrates, be the Consuls Pretours and Censors, the rest as
Aediles, Questors, were accounted inferior. etc.

( a) CRASSVS is named for one, who entered into 18
a bond for him of 830. talents, what time CAESAR deeply indebted, said, his
millies and q^ingenties centena millia nullu^ sibi ad^sse oportere, ut nilid
haberet, id est, that 250. millions of sesterces would but set him clear with
the world.

( b) By the Laws, none might make suit for a triumph, but whiles they
remained absent without the city, nor for a Consulship ^cept they were present
as private persons within the city. In these streights, CAESAR made choice to
be Consul, and gave over his right to a triumph, for the victory obtained in
Spain over the Calleci and Lusitanes. 19


( a) THE manner was at Rome, that they who sved for Magistracies should for
the obteining of the peoples voices and suffrages make promise of certain
sums of money to be distributed among them and such as were appointed to
deal the said Largess, they called Divisores. Now, for that the Election of
Consuls passed by Comitia centuriata that is, by the assembly of the people, by
their centuries or Hundreds according as Ser^. Tullus first ordained them,
therefore was this money to be divided amongst them, as they gave their voices.

( b) Provinces signify three things, the countries conquered or yielded, and
the same governed by Roman Deputies: and this is the proper and primative
signification thereof. also the Region wherein any Roman General by commission
from the state makes war: and last of all, what public function or affairs
soever is to be administered. In which sense it is here taken.

( c) Either for the cutting down of trees for the best commodities: or else
for a guard to be kept near unto them, to suppress the outrage committed by
thieves, haunting the same and robbing and spoiling passengers.

( d) To amend the ways and beaten paths, where, either wayfairing men or
beasts should pass with more ^ase. And verily these were base mattes and
requiring no great forces to be performed: and so by consequence, the Consuls
employed therein could compass no great projects and therefore less to be
feared.

( e) This society bred the Civil war that after ensued, between CEASAR
and POMPEIVS unto which the Poet Lucan alluded writing thus.

T^ causa malorum
Facta tribus dominis communis Roma. 20

( a) As well to avoid tedious canuassings and consultations as to provide for
the history and memorial of every matter.

( b) One of the Consuls only had the twelve Lictors going before him, with
the rods and axes: to wit, each of them their months, by turns one after the
other, Ne si ambo fasc^s baberent duplicatus terror videretur. As LIVIE
writes: An ordinance as ancient well near, as the first institution of
Consuls.

( c) ACCENSVS, an officer attendant upon Magistrate, so named ab acciend^, id
est, of giuingsummons to any for appearance, or of calling any to the
Magistrate.

( d) Great indulgences, immunities and privileges were granted by the R^anes
unto those that had j^ trium liberorum: but as APPIAN writes more particularly
to the explication of this place, there assembled 20000 together, craving
maintenance and food every man, for three children and more that they had.

( e) Publicanes were they that either for a certain rent took to ferme the
public revenewes of the City, whether it were corn, pasturage, customs,
impostes, etc. or undertook by the gross to make provision for the state, or
to build and repair any citie-workes. etc. 2^


( a) THIS was not more maiorum, for then his sentence should have been
demanded first, that by the Censors was elected Princeps Senatus. id est,
President of the Counsel: but extraordinarily, as appears by Aul. Gel. Noct.
Attic. lib. 4. cap. 10. and lib. 14. cap. 7. 2^


( a) FOR as LIVIE testifies lib. 38. The Romans triumphed oftener over the
Gauls, than ever all the world beside.

( b) Which VATINIVS a Tribune of the Commons proposed in the behalf of JULIUS
CEA SAR, that for five years together, he should (without casting lots, and
the Senates decree), govern CISALPINE Gaul, together with Illyricum:
contrary to the Law Sempronia, which provided that such Provincial
Governors, or LL. Deputies, should yearly be chosen by the Senate. Carol.
Sigon. lib. 2. cap. 1. de antiquo (...) provinciarum.

( c) CISALPINA GALLIA, is that, which lay between Italy and the Alps,
divided into CISPADANA and TRANSPADANA, according to the site thereof, either
on this side, or beyond the river PO: it carried the name likewise of TOGATA,
either because it was much inhabited by the Romans, or for that unto this
Province the Roman Robe TOGA was granted, or el^ in regard that the said
Province was more civil and peaceable, than the other called TRANSALPINA.

( d) COMATA GALLIA, a part of GALLIA TRAHSALPINA, lying beyond the Alpe^, from
Italy toward Spain: so called for the long haite that they wore: and (...) put
for the whole TRANSALPINE Province, like as BRACHATA, one part of the said
Province, so called of a certain kind of apparel, is taken for the whole and
confounded with Comata.

( e) This term, which they commonly use, who threaten such as they contemn,
may be^ drawn to an obsceene and filthy sense, not here to be named: and
albeit CEASAR hereby was galled to the quick, as privy to himself, of the
passive abuse of his body with K. NICONEDES, yet in his answer thereto, he
turned it to another signification.

( f) Warlike women, so called (as some write) of their paps which they did cut
off and fear, thereby to be more expedite and nimble in fight, and to shoot at
greater case. See Strabo, Justin. Q. Curtius, Herodo^us etc.

( a) FOR, if his Questour or Treasurer had been 23
condemned, it would have been a shrewde precedent for his conviction also in
the same cause.

( a) WHO stood in Election for the Consulshippe: 24
so called of the whited robe, which they put on* who sued for such
Magistracies and places of Honor. For whereas the ordinary gown that Roman
citizens daily ^ore, was white of it self, against such a time they made it
whiter with chalk: so that a difference there was between Toga a^ba, and
candida, whereupon they were called Candidat^, as appears by Macrobius, and
T. Liuius, lib. 4 ab ur^. condita

( b) Supplication, was a solemn Honor done unto the Lord General of a
Province upon some notable victory For the manner was, that LL. Governors,
after they were by their Soldiers salute by the name of Emperor. 1 Sovereign
commanders, should send them Letters dight with Laurel unto the Senate, wherein
they required both to be styled by the said name, and also to have solemn
processions made by the people in the Temples, and thanksgiving unto the Gods
for their good success, which solemnity, at the first continued but one day,
as T. LIVIVS reports in the 304. year after the foundation of Rome: but
process of time, it grew to 4* and 12. And at length, CEASAR obtained it for
15. yea and 20. days together, as PLVTARCH testifies in his life, and
himself in his own Comentaries, of the Gauls war.

( a) Super HS. millies. This character HS. stands ^6
for a Silver coin in Rome, which is the three half pence, farthing, cue, the
4. part of Denarius: and is called Sextertius quasi sesquitertius: as one would
say, valuing two brazen Asses and the half of a third: so common a piece of
money there, that Numus put absolutely alone, stands for it and no other
coin: so that Millies sestertium and millies nummum, are both one. Now if the
Roman Denier be valued at vij d. ob. with us, and 100. Deniers arise to one
pound starling: this sum here set down, that is to say, a Sesterne
multiplied by the Aduerbe Millies, amounts by just account unto 25000. li.
starling* And thereto for the overdeale or surplufage ducenties sestertium,
which is one 5. part of the former sum, it makes up ^70000. li. sterling. A
thing that may be thought incredible, but that we read that CEASAR himself
said, he was 250. millions in debt when he went into Spain, and P. CLODIVS,
whom MILO slew, dwelt in a house, the purchase whereof cost him almost 15.
millions. No marvel therefore, if so many houses, which CAESAR must needs buy
for the plot of ground aforesaid and in so populous a city, cost not so little
as a hundred millions*

( a) THE dole given by a Prince or great man 27
unto the people, was properly called a Congiarie, which word took name of the
measure Congi^ among the Romans, consisting of 6. Sextarij, and is answerable
to our gallon: by which Oil or wirie was given. Howbeit (...), any such
public munificence, in money or otherwise is so called: and in this place, by
it are meant other gifts bestowed upon private persons.

( a) IN some copies, we read, Quando nec 28
plebisicito POMPEIVS postea abrogasset. To this sense. That CAESAR being
absent, was not eligible by virtue of an Act made by POMPEIVS to that effect,
considering he had not abrogated the same by any ordinance of the people, but
only of his own authority corrected it after it stood upon record in the city
chamber. 30


( a) THIS has reference unto his violent dealing with his fellow Consul
Bibulis. See before in the 20. chapter.

( a) THE fourth finger next unto the little one 33
honored especially with a gold ring, for that there is an evident artery
from the heart reaching unto it. GELLIVS. But PLINY alleges another reason.

( a) He would do any thing rather than his soldiers so well deserving at his
hands, should not be satisfied: such a credit carried the ring upon a Romans
finger.

( c) Which is the State and worth of a Roman knight or gentleman according
to this verce of Horace Si quadringintis sex, septem millia desint, P^ebseris
etc, and amounts to 3125. li. starling.

( a) As if Petreius, Afranius, and Varro had no skill in martial feats. 34


( b) He means C^. Pompeius, for his military knowledge and warlike
exploytes surnamed Magnus. i. the Great* whose principal power was now
overthrown at Ilerda in Spain.

( a) LYCH^VCHOS Gestantibus, bearing either 37
young men that carried Linckes, Torches, and ^esset lights: or else branches
and candle sticks, resembling them, and holding the said lights: Some read,
Lychnos gestantibus. 1. bearing lights: but to the same affect.

( a) Super bina HS. i. Sestertia: that is to say, 15 li. 38
125. 6 d.

( b) Quaterna Sestertia. 1. 31. li. 5 s.

( c) VICENA quaterna millia. 187 li. 10 s. By which reck^ing, he gave unto
horsemen four times as much as to footmen. Look in the marginall note to the
text, and you shall find this donative much more: which may seem incredible:
but consider what provinces he spoiled, and what pillage he made, in regard
whereof he was called of the Greeks (...).

( d) Denos modios, in round reckoning may go for ten peckes or hoopes with us.

( e) Totidem libras. 1. so many pynts, with the better

Which being put together, make 100. Denarij or Drachemes, that is. one Mina,
and amount in all to 3. li. 2 s. 6.
( f) Trecenos nummos. 1. 46. s. 10 d. ob. ( g) Centenos. i. 15 s. 7 d. ob.
( h) Bina millia nummorum. 1. 15. lib. 12. s. 6 d.

( i) Quingenos sestertios. i. 3. l. 18 s. 1 d. ob.

( a) Regionatim urbe tota. Rome, as PLINY 39
witnesses, was divided into 14. regions, and every one of these had their
several Stage Plays by themselves.

( b) The Games Circenses, I take to be so called of the Greet Cirque or
Shewplace, wherein they were performed: and not of swords, wherewith they were
environed, as one would say, Circa enses. Indeed these games resembled the
Olympic in Greece by ELIS, where the runners with chariots were he^med in of
the one side with the running river, and of the other with swords pitched
pointwise, that they should hold on the race directly, and not swerve aside
without danger. Herein were performed running with horses and chariots,
Iusting, ult, and Turnement: baiting and chasing of wild beasts, etc.

( c) Pyrrhica: Of some, thought to be the same that ENOPLIA, was a kind of
Moriske dance, after a warlike manner in harnois, devised in Creta first by
Pyrrhus. Plin. lib. 7. Not. Hist. cap. 56. In which young gentlemen were
trained to exercise all parts of the body by sundry gestures as well to avoid
all venues and defend themselves, as to annoy and (...) the enemy.

( d) This DECIMVS LABERIVS was a Poet also, that kind which wrote wanton Poems
or Iasciviovs Comoedies called Mimi. For, howsoever in all Stage Plays, there
is represented a lively imitation in gesture and voice of others, yet in these
Mimi, these same are done after a more licentious manner and without all
modestreverence, even in unseemely and filthy arguments: as OVID testifies in
these words, imitante, turpia Mimi. It seems therefore, that as well the
Poemes as the Authors and Actour^ be called Mimi

( e) Orchestra, is here taken for the most commodious place in the Theater,
wherein the Senators and Nobles of Rome were allowed to sit and behold the
Stage Plays, apart from the people. For so the Poet IVVENAL understands it
in these words, Similem que videbis Orchestram and populum.

As torching this Orchestra and the Poet LABERIVS above named, SENECA in his
second book of Controversies, and third controversy reports thus. JULIUS
CAESAR at the solemnity of his Plays, brought LABERIVS forth to act upon the
Stage: and when he had made him a gentleman, or Knight of Rome, willed him to
take his place among them of that degree, but as he came toward them, they all
sat so close and near o^e another, that there was no row ^e for him. Now by
the way, you must understand that CICERO then in place, (...) (...) himself an
ill name, for that he was no fa^t and faithful friend, either to POMPEIVS, or
to CEASAR, but a flatterer of them both. Again, CAESAR at that time had chosen
many unto the range of Senators, partly to supply and make up their number,
which during the late civil wars was much diminished, and in part to
gratify those who had well deserved of him and the side CICERO therefore
alluding to the extraordinary number of new Senators, sent unto LABERIVS as
he passed by, this word merrily, Recepissem te nisi anguste sederent* i. I
would have taken you to me and give you a place, but that I* sit my self very
straight. Then LABERIVS returned this pleasant answer back unto him, Atqui
solebas duabus sellis sedere. i. And yet you were wont to sit upon two stools,
skoffing at him for his double dealing with POMPEIVS and CEASAR.

( f) The Troy fight, was in warlike manner on horsbacke, brought by Aeneas
into Italy. The manner whereof is described by Virgil Aeneid. 5.

( g) These Goales called in Latin Met^s, about which the horses and chariots
ran, were in fashion broad beneath and sharp above, in manner of Pyramides,
Steeples or cocks of hey, and for their matter, of wood first, or of ^oft
gritstone, but afterward of marble and laid over with gold. Concerning this
Cirque why CAESAR enlarged it and brought water round about it, Read PLINY 8.
lib. cap. 7. and 36. lib cap. 15. Natural Hist.

( h) To try maisteries in footemanshippe, leaping, flinging the coit or
hammer,, darting and wrestling: which Game was called Pentathlon, of those five
kinds of exercises.

( i) In minore Codeta, which was a place on the further side of TIBERIS so
called of certain plots of young springs or shootes there growing which
resemble horsetailes, Some read In more^ cocble^, that is, narrow beneath and
broad above, like to the shell of a periwincle or such like fish. 40


( a) This day is called Bissextus, and falls out to be the fifth day before
the end of Rebruarie, to wit, the sixth before the Calends of March, by
interposing whereof, we say twice Sext Calend Martij, of which day our leap
year has the name Bissextilis.

( a) Which by the first institution were 300 and 41
by occasion of the late troubles much impaired.

( b) Patritios allegit: For those that were Plebei generis, might be
Senators: or else, as so ne expound it, he advanced diverse to the degree and
rank of the Patritij.

( c) All but Consuls, Praetors and Censors, were counted inferior Magistrates.

( d) For the Censours with the public Notaries ordinarily took this
reviewe, and that in Campus Martius, and Villa publica.

( e) By reason of so great a number receiving corn from the State, the
purveyance hereof stood the citiy yearly as Plutarch writes in a thousand
two hundred and fifty talents.

( f) For they might discontinue out of Italy eleven years. Plutarch.

( g) Such were called Conites, or quasi ex cohort^ Praetoria, as it were
gentlemen of the privy chamber.

( h) Nova^ ta^larum. To w^t, when the old^ bonds being cancelled, and thereby
former debts r^mitted, new obligations were made.

( i) Parricid^ i. Parenticid^, such as kill father, mother, brother, sisters
and such like, nere in blood* as also, any other man or woman wilfully,
according to the Law of K. NVME, Si quis hominem liberum sc^s ^onti duit
parricida est^.

( a) (...) convictos. Such governors as by way of extortion pilled and polled
the Provinces ^
which they ruled: who after their time expired, were many times called
judicially to their answers.

( b) Many Laws there were called Sumptuaria and Ci^ariae, to restrain the
excess at the table, as namely ^nia, Licinia, (...), Iulia etc. Read. Aul.
Gell. Noct. At. lib. 2. c^p. 24. Macro. Saturnal. lib. 3.

( a) Of whom TERENTIANVS writes thus, ^ir doctissimus unde^que Varr^.

( b) Ist^ is a narrow strait or foreland by Corinth, ^
fue miles over, lying between the two ^eas L^mium and Aegeu^, or as PLINY
writes. lib. 4. cap. 4. between the two Gulfes Corinthi^s and (...). The
cutting through whereof, was attempted before by K. DEMETRIUS, and afterward
by C. CALIGVLA and NERO, but without effect.

( c) Which CRASSVS before him had not done; and therefore was overthrown. 45


( a) COMITIALI MOREO, so called, for that the assemblies of the people called
Cemitia, were dissolved and broke up by occasion thereof, in case any one among
them fell down of that disease, according as Q. SERENVS SEMO^ICVS has
testified in these verses. cap. 57.

Est morbi species subiti, cui (...) ab illo est,
Quod fieri nobis suffragia justa recusant.
S^pe etenim membris ac^i (...) caduci^,
Concilium populi la^es horrend^ (...).
As also for that, they who were subject thereto, fell into a fit thereof
ordinarily at such assemblyes, if they were crossed in their suites and
businesses there, CORNELIUS CELSVS calls it Mor^um ma^rem, i. a great
sickness. It is named likewise (...) i. the sacred disease, either because it
affects the head, which is the most honorable place of the body and the
^eate of the Soul, or in regard of the greatness thereof, which the Gracians
expect by the word (...). Also ^pilepsia, for the sudden invasion of it.
HERCVLEVS MOR^VS, either for the strength of the malady, whereby a man is
forced to fall, or because HERCULES was troubled therewith. PLINY names it,
S. uticum, for the hurt that it does unto the body: Others (...), ^or that
upon it, men fall to the ground: it is called Moreover Lunati^, of the Moon:
because it keeps time with the course of the Moon, or apprehends them that
are borne in the change thereof, as the same SEREN^S reports in these verses.

Huc quoque (...) dubiae pertempora (...)*
Conceptum talem, quem saepe ruina prof^it.
Lastly HIPPOCRATES names i^ (...). i. puerilem morbum, for that children be
subject thereto: whereupon some term it, Maier puerorum.

( b) This manner of going so loosely girt, might signify a dissolute and
(...) wanton. Hereupon CICERO made cl oyce in the civil war to take part
with POMPEIVS against CEASAR: And when one asked him how it came to pass, that
in siding with POMPEIVS he was so much overseene, for that he had the worse,
this answer he made Praeci^ctura me decepit: i. deceived I was by that loose
guiding of his.

( a) CAESAR derived his pedigree from IU^LVS 49
the son of AENEAS whose m^er was VENUS.

( b) The grace which is in the Latin cannot be expressed well in English,
because the word, Subegit carries a double sense, the one signifies the
conquering of a nation, and so it is taken in the former place, as it is
applied to Gaul: the other, the wanton abuse of the body: in which acception
it is to be understood in reference to CEASAR, abused by K. Nich^edes. 50


( a) In the two fold sense likewise of these two words, Tertia and Deducta
lies the pleasant grace of this conceipted speech.

By the one, may be understoode, that a third part of the price was deducted:
by the other Cicero meant, That her daughter TERTIA was brought by her to his
bed. 51


( a) THIS Distichon, or ^j verses, which his soldiers after their licentious
manner in the Triumph chaunted may thus be Englished.

Look to your wives, ye cytizens, a l^cher bald we bring.
In Gaul Adultery cost thee gold, heere'tis (...) borrowing.
For, as he borrowed of other men, so he lent or paid as much again, in
that his own wife POMPEIA, as is thought, was kept by P. 52
CLODIVS.

( a) SVCH a vessel as this named here Thelameg^s, and by Seneca 7. lib. ^e
Peneficijs ^lata, (...) (...), as witnesses ATHENEVS had, which carried in
length (...) d^u^.
half a furlong, in breadth. 30. cubits, and in height little less then 40.

( b) Impudicitiae, I observe, that both in this Author and also in other
approved writers, Impudicitia, is properly and peculiarly taken for that
abominable uncleanness only, which is named Sodo^e: Like as Pudicitiae, for
the integrity of the body, and clear nesse from that detestable filthiness.
And so, Pudic^s and Impudicus are to be understood.

( a) WHICH comes to 23. pound, 8. shillings, 54
9. pence, and is not much more than half the worth. According to Bude^s it
was 7. pound dim of Silver for one of Gold.

( b) For it was esteemed a great honor to be called Allies and Associates, or
styled Kings, by the people of Rome.

( c) ANTICATONES. Whereas CICERO 56
had written in the praise of CATO [VTICENSIS] he wrote two books against the
said CATO, which he called Anticatones.

( a) VENUS surnamed Genitrix i. Mother, CAESAR honored, as the goddess from
60
the which he was descended, by IU^LVS or ACANIVS her nephew.

( b) The principal ensign or standerd of the Roman Legion was an Aegle of
Silver, reared upon a Spear top, the point whereof beneath was sharp, and
fastened into the ground: and the same stood within a little shrine, not to be
remooved, but when the Army was on foot.

( a) DION, lib. 42. and APPIAN. Civil. 2. report this otherwise: namely, that
he forsook the said Coat armor (it clogged him so much) and so the Egyptians
got it.

( a) EVIATICO suo. Albeit riaticum properly 6^
signifies the store and provision set by for a journey, yet here it is put
for the wealth and substance of a soldier: like as in Horat. lib. 2. epist. 2.

Luculli miles collecta v^atica multis Aerum^is, etc.

In which sense, (...) likewise in Greek is taken.

( b) PLINY calls it Lapsana. lib. 19 cap. 8. Natural. Histor. A kind of
wild worte or cole.

( c) To be tithed, i. every tenth man to suffer death. Appian.

( d) Which ordinarily consisted of 550. footmen, and 66. horse, whereof ten
went to a Legion. Some, I wot well had more, some fewer. But for this place it
may suffice, that it was the tenth part of a Legion.

( a) QVIRITES. i. Roman Citizens. As 70
freed now from their allegiance, which by their military oath they were bound
unto.

( a) WHICH was a great abuse offered, among 71
the Barbarians, who set great store by their beards, and suffered them to grow
very long.

( a) THENSA or Tensa and ferculum a Chariot 76
of Silver or Yvorie with a frame in it sustaining the Images of the gods,
which was drawn in most solemn and stately manner unto the Pulvinar.

( b) Pulvinar. A bed lost, or place where certain rich beds were made for the
said Images to be laid upon.

( c) FLAMIN. A certain priest, bearing the name of that god, for whose
service he was instituted. As Dialis of IVPITER, Martialis of MARS, Quirin^lis
of ROMULUS, etc. Cic. 2. Phil. says that M. ANTONIUS, was Flamen to Julius
Caesar.

( d) Luperci, were certain young m^n, who at the Licentions feast, Lupercalia
instituted to the honor of PAN LYCA^VS, otherwise called IVNVS, by ROMULUS and
REMVS, ran up and down naked in the City of Rome. A new kind of these Luperci
ordained CAESAR, of his own name called IVLIANI. At this feast Lupercalia, M.
ANTONIUS played the part of a Lupercu^, at which solemmue, when CAESAR sat in a
Throne of Gold, arrayed in a purple robe, the said M ANTONIUS attempted to do
upon his head the royal Band, called a Diadem* Cicero.

( e) Whereas, before it was called (...), he named it Julius.

( f) This was Caninius Rebitus: of whose Consulship, there go diverse ^estes,
as namely these, whereof CICERO was the Author, a vigilant Consul we have had
of CANINIVS, who in all his Consulship never slept wink. Also, a consell we
have had so severe and Censar-like, as that during his Consulship, no man
dined, no man supped, no man so much as once slept. Likewise PI^HALVS said of
him* Heretofore we had Flamines Diales, and now we have Consuls Diales,
playing upon the aequivocation or double sense of the word Dialis, which being
derived of (...) Jupiter signifies his Flamin: but of Dies. i. a day,
betokens a day Consul or Flamin.

( a) ACCORDING to LVCANA. Omnia 77
Casar era^. Caesar was all in all.

( b) Well known it is that SVLLA was passing well learned both in Greek and
Latin. But in that he resigned up the absolute power of his Dactatorship,
which he took upon him, for an hundred and twenty years, that is to say, for
ever. CAESAR said he was no Gramarian, quia nescivirit dictare, quod munus est
Grammatici: alluding to the word ambiguus dictare i. to endite, or give
precepts as Grammarians do to their scholars, as also, to command
absolutely, whereof it may seem that Dictator took the name*

( a) WHO were in number. 10.

( b) Or, if I may for Pontius Aquila: spoken by 78
way of a scornful Ironia.

( a) PLEBEIO, and not Plebi, for the commens 79
could not endure that name, as may appear by CICEROES words in his second
Philippica or invective against M. ANTONIUS. Thou show the Diadem. The
people all over the common place gave a groan thereat. Thou were about to set
it upon his head, to the great grief and sorrow of the people, he rejected
it, with as great joy and applause of theirs.

( b) The name OPTIMVS, MAXIMUS, wherewith the ancients styled Jupiter,
signifies most bountiful and most powerful: wherein it is observed that
Bounty goes before Power: because as M. TVLLIVS writes, it is better and
more acceptable to do good v^o all, then to have power over all.

( c) In Egypt: A renowned City, built by King ALEXANDER the great: for the
pleasant site much commended, and therefore might be affected by CAESAR: at
which, there is no day almost through the year, but the Inhabitants behold the
Sun shining clear upon them* And which AMMIANVS calls Verticem omnium
civitatum, i. The chief of Cities.

( d) Ilium, a City where Tr^y stood: The Citizens whereof, as STRABO writes,
CAESAR in memorial of his progenitots from thence descended, and namely, from
IVLVS or ASCANIVS the Son of AENEAS, had endowed with many franchises and
immunities, and therefore it carried some likelihood, that he meant there to make
his abode.

( e) These Quindeeim-viri, or fifteen men, were instituted in the days of
CORNELIUS SYLLA with this addition Sacrorum: unto whose charge it appertained
to see that Sacrifices and Divine service, that supplications, and processions,
expiations, and ceremonial rites should be duly performed, as also to pervse
the books and prophesies of SIBYLLA: At first they were but two, called (...),
afterward x. under the name of Decemviri sacris faciendis. Alex ab Alex. lib.
3. Genial. dierum. cap. 16.

( a) BONVM factum. A form of preface 80
which in old time they use boni omnis causa, before their Edictes and
decrees* etc. so commonly, as that these two Capital letters B. F. did betoken
the same as ordinarily, as S. C. stand for Senatus consultum. It had the same
use, as In nomine Dei with us.

( b) Some take these Brachae, whereof Brachata Gallia, a part of Transalipine,
Gaul took name, For frize rugges striped with sundry colors, which may
resemble Irish mantles; but I suppose them to be a kind of course breches,
much like to the Irish trousses, but that they are more full.

( c) By rising up unto him, and shouting or applauding as he passed along*

( d V^inam viveres.

( e)

Brutus quia Reges ejecit consul primus factus est:
Hic, quia consules ejecit, Rex postrem^ factus est.
( f) Certain bridges there were for the time made, upon which the Tribes
passed when they gave their voices in Lampus Martius, at their solemn Leets
and assemblies for Election of Magistrates.

( a) Some take it to be the same that REGVLVS, 81
or TROCHILVS. Thought to be the Wren, and is likewise named King of Birds, in
Greek (...), OMINOVS therefore unto CAESAR, seeking to be king.

( b) This is diversely reported by authors the occasion of which variety
arises upon the affinity of these names CASSIVS and CASCA. For as there were
two CASSII at this action, so likewise were there two SERVILII brethren, both
surnamed CASCA. By, ALTER CASSIVS or CASCA therefore, you may understand one of
the two brethren, or the second of them. For some write, that the one CASCA
gave him in the neck a wound, but not deadly, whereupon CAESAR caught hold of
his dagger crying out, Scelerate CASCA quid agis? i. What meanest thou, O
wicked CASCA, and then CASCA called unto his brother for help, who came in,
and gave him his deaths wound, in the breast under the channel bone, PLUTARCH.

( c) Albeit, Graphium does signify a writing punch, (or steel or wier),
otherwise called Stylus, wherewith they wrote in hard matter, as wood, or
bark, before the use of our parchment and paper, as also our pen made of a
quill or other substance, as brass, etc. in which sense it is taken in that
verse of OVID. (...). lib. 1. Eleg. 11:

Quid digitos opus est graphium l^ssare tenendo?

And probable it is that CAESAR sitting in counsel was not without such a
writing instrument: yet both DOMINICVS MARIUS upon the foresaid verse, and
PEROTTVS also the author of CORNVCOPIA, expounding this place of SVETONIVS,
takes Graphium, pro pugiunculo, i. A little poyniard, poinado, or pocket
dagger. And hapely therewith CAESAR wounded CASSIVS or CASCA (whether you will)
being more ready at hand, hanging at his girdle, than the style or steel
aforesaid, which by all likelihood was yet in the case or sheath, called
Graphiarium, considering CAESAR was but new set. But I leave the exposition of
this place, in medio.

( d) VALERIVS MAX. under the title of VERECVNDIA, commends this maydenlike
modesty of CAESAR, who notwithstanding that he was masakred with 23. wounds,
for manhood sake forgot not to hide his nakedness, and to die in decent
manner: but as EURIPIDE^ writes of the virgin Lady Polixena.

(...)

Where, by the way it may be noted, that the Romans wore not trusses or
breches, as we do, to cover those inferior and secret parts.

( e) This may have reference to that which is reported before, how in his
youth, he loved SERVILIA, the mother of this BRUTUS: For his age falls out to
agree fitly with that time: in so much as he was commonly thought to be a son
of his. And yet this attribute Fili, may sort well with the familiarity that
was between them.

Some read (...). i. And art thou one of them?

( a) VIRGINI Vestali Maxim. That Nun or Vestall 83
virgi^, who in age and dignity excelled theres^ and was the Mysteries as ^
were, and governesse of them, they called MAXIMA: much like unto the Lady
Ab^esse or Prioresse in our days.

( a) The (...) whereof w^ the deciding of the contention between AJAX and
ULYSSES, about ACHILLES Armor.

( b) FOR some of these who took part with POMPEIVS, 84

ANNOTATIONS UPON Octauius Augustus Caesar.
( a) INTER divisores, operasque Compestres. This was thought to be but a base
occupation, namely, to give among the Tribes, such sums of money, as the
Candidats, or those that stood in election for offices promised and pronounced
for the buying of voices. The name also grew to be odious, howsoever PLAVTVS in
A^lul. calls them Magistros Curiae. Likewise all such servitours as otherwise
gave attendance in Campo Martio, and thereby g^t a living, whom he terms here
op^ras campest res, were but of mean reckoning.

( a) Regione P^tij. In old time Rome was divided into four principal regions
or quarters. Suburrana, ^quiline, Collina, and Palatina.

( b) The manner in old time was, that the new borne babe should be set up on
the bare ground to cry and call upon the Goddess Ops, who so gently had
received it. And the Goddess forsooth, that helped to lift it up again, was
called Levana. i. a Levando. Augustine. (...).

( a) THE Virile robe was the ordinary Roman gown, all white without purple,
which they wore when they came to be past. 16. years of age.

( b) To wit, bracelets, chains and collars, Spear sta^es without iron heads,
trappings, chaplets and guirlands, etc.

( c) This was the Triumvirate, so much spoken of: during which, M. ANTONIUS,
M. LEPIDVS and AUGUSTUS ruled jointly together.

( a) MARCUS BRUTUS.

( b) He means CICERO, as appears by an Epistle of D. BRUTUS unto CICERO
in these words, Narrav^t mihi etc. ipsum Caesarem. (Augustum) nihil san^ de te
q^stum nisi (...) quod di^ret, te dixisse ^dum adolescen^, ornandum, tollendu^:
se non commissu r^m ut tolli possit In which words, as also in this place of
TRANQVILLVS, there is an aequivocati^n or doubtful sense in this Verb
Tollendum: which in one signification, is in manner aequ^val: ^t with laudandum
and ernandum; and betokens, to be advanced, extolled, or lifted up: and so
is to be taken in good part: but in another, it is all one with tollendum de
medio, or occidendum, id est, to be dispatched out of life: or killed. In which
sense CICERO meant it, and AUGUSTUS took it, namely in ill part. Much like to
this, you shall read in Nero, sustulit l^c matre^, sustulit ille patrem. The
grace lies in the ambiguitie of the Latin word tollendum, which cannot in
English be so well delivered.

( a) The Eg^ij, as APPIAN witnesses.

( a) Which by the Law IVLIA THEATRALIS, and ROSCIA, were allowed for the
knights or Gentlemen of Rome, whose estate was valued not under 400000.
Sesterces. The laws abovesaid, were promulged by AUGUSTUS CAESAR, and L.
ROSCIVS OTHO a Tribune of the Commons. And these 14. Seats named Equestria,
were the next unto the stage after the Orcestra arising by degrees and stairs,
as it were higher and higher, and so farther of. Above which in the upper and
more remote scaffolds sat the common people, and thereupon they were called
POPVLARIA. Howbeit, for all the law Roscia, many Commoners of good wealth and
credit, used to sit indifferently in the said 14. foremost seats, until the
other Law IVLIA was enacted, which distinguished the orders more precisely.
Carol. Sigon. De Antiq. Iur. Civ. Romans lib. 2. cap. 19.

( a) When in stately Pomp, the sacred chariot Thensa, with the images of the
Gods in it, was devoutly drawn according to the solemn manner.

( b) A coast-towne of Italy affronting Sicile, from whence it is a very short
cut over sea ^so called by the Greeks, as if even there a breach was made by
the sea, dividing Italy from Sicilie which before time was a part of the
continent or maine land: And no mervaile of that Name* since that M^itine
Region, wherein Locri stood, was in times past called Magna Gracia.

( c) In that he put down in his will the children which he had by CLEOPATRA
a stranger and Barbarian horn, which also were begotten in bastardie, as well
as if they had been natural Romans and legitimate, he faulted in common
civilitie, but much more, when he proceeded to call the sons that he had by
her, Reges Regum. i. the King of Kings. As absurd also and immodest he showed
himself, when having by her at one birth two twins, the male infant he
surnamed Sol. i. the Sun, and the Femall, Luna 1. the Moon.

( d) In the custody of the Vestall Nuns, or Votaries, as IVLVS C^SAR had
done before him: of such integrity and so good conscience they were thought to
be, as things of greatest weight were committed unto them in trust.

( e) This forename, TITUS cannot truly be given to any of the Domitij, if that
be true which is written of them afterward in Domitius Nero. cap. 1.

( f) But in the behalf of M. ANTONIUS, considering he was their Patron and
Protector. For other forain States and Cities usually were ^hrouded under the
favor of Gentlemen at Rome. In which regard, he laid not to their charge that
they had not sided with himself, but rather taken part with their Patron
ANTONII: considering that nere bond wherewith such Protectors and Clients or
Dependents were linked together: which DION^SIVS supposes to be almost as
ancient as Rome it self, and almost aequall to that of Allies, yea and
kinsfolk in blood.

( g) A Promontorie or Cape in EPIRVS, shooting into the way Ambracium, in the
view whereof the sumptuous Armada of (...) and Cleopatra was defaited.

( a) THESE Psylli are people in Affricke supposed 17
to have bodies of a singular virtue to kill Serpents, as also a special skill
in sucking forth venom out of the wound made by their sting. Yet CORNELIUS
CELSVS. lib. 5. cap. 27. is of opinion, that they have no principal gift or
cunning in this feate above other men, but more boldness rather, confirmed by
use and practice: For the venom of a serpent, says he, hurts not by being
tasted, but as it is infused by a wound, which he proves by those poisons that
the French use especially in ^siting. And therefore a very Snake or Adder it
self, may be eaten safely, how ever the sting is deadly: and if whiles it
lies astonished or benumbed (the cast whereof these Monte-bankes or juglers have
by means of certain medicines) one put his finger into the mouth thereof, and
be not bitten or stung withal, there is no spettle or slimie humous there to
do harm. So that whosoever else, by example of these Psylli shall suck a
worem and inflicted by a Serpent, he shall do it safely, and cure besides, the
party that is stung. Provided always, that he have no sore ^r ulcer, in
gummes, palate, or any part of his limbs.

( b) Some think this kind of Aspis which (...) used, was P^yas, (...)*
others Hyp^le; for that the sting brought drowsinesse upon her: and Luc^
called it Aspida (...). But (...) is unto all the so^es to kill by sleep and
stupefaction without pain, some sooner, some later: but all within the space
of 6. hours: So that Hypnale may seem to be a general attribute to them all.

( a) As if he counted those Ptol^ees dead, 18
who left no memorable acts behind them. And Alexander, a King still, or
worthy alone to be called King, whose memorial was yet so fresh and lively.

( a) FOR that one of his parents was a Parthine, 19
that is to say, a stranger of Illyircum, and the other a Roman.

( a) WARS take the name of those that be 20
vanquished. As, Gallicum bellum, Germanic^, Dalmatuum, etc. in which Ga^le,
Germany, and Dalmati^ be subdued.

( b) Some take this bridge to be a kind of Fabric or skaffold reared for the
assault of the town Metulium, and not an ordinary bridge built over some
river.

( a) THIS temple, as appears afterward, he 21
had vowed in the Philippian war, which he undertook in revenge of his
Father JULIUS CAESAR'S death, and therefore dedicated it unto MARS, Revenger.

( a) THE Temple of IANVS QV^VS, o^ 22
QVIRINI, because it was first founded by Romulus, N^a Po^pilius his successor
ordained to be set open in time of war, and shuite when there was peace.
Whereupon IANVS was termed under a two-folde name, Patuci^ and Clausi^s. Once
it was shu^ in the said N^a his reign; and a second time, afte^ the first
Punick war ended, when M. At^lius, and T. M^lius, or M^llius, were Consuls.
At all time^ before and after it stood open, until AVOVSTVS CAESAR'S days.
During whose Empire it was thrice shut. First, upon the defeature of ANTONIUS
and CLEOPATRA before ACTIV^* Secondly, after his victory in Spain over the
Cantabri: Last of all, when all Nations (in manner) of the earth by occasion of
his victories, grew to an universal peace. About which time our Savior JESUS
Christ, IMMANV^L, that True Peace maker between God and ^e, was borne. Thus
OROSIVS reputeth, and reads, ter, not tertio. Howbeit LIVIE seems to
acknowledge, but once, namely, upon the Actiack victory.

( b) Ovation was a kind of petie triumph: wherein the Captains victors rode
not in a Chariot, nor wore a Coronet of Laurel, but of the Myrtle. It took
the name ab ovibus. i. Sheep Sacrificed, or rather all the voice, Ov^, which
the Soldiour in their acclamations resounded.

( a) THE Roman Army consisted of Legions, 23
who were all Romans, and of Auxilia. i. aids and those were of Allies and
confederate notions.

( b) This day, was Ante diem quart^ (...). Sextil. 1. the second day of
August. Which was also that very day of the month, wherein the Romans in
times past suffered the desasterous overthrow at Canna.

( a) BY which the people of Rome won their immortal 24
fame, and conquered the whole world as Ci^ro says: Pro Mur^na.

( b) December, January, and February.

( c) Thereby disabling them for being serviceable soldiers.

( d) These Publicanes, so called for that they fermed their Cities revenewes,
as Customs, ^olles, ^mposts, etc. were likewise Knights or Gentlemen of Rome,
and by being so earnest to buy out one of their own sort, were thought to
favor him, and minded presently to dismiss him at liberty: which was contrary
to his intent.

( a) FOR his Uncle and Predecessor JULIUS 25
CAESAR, had taken up that familiar term of COMMILITONES, by occasion of so
many troubles that followed him, and therefore was driven to speak his
Soldiers fair.

( b) Libertines were those who having been bond were made free or manumised:
and these were not capable of Militia Romana, but in time of great extremity
and desperate cases.

( c) It seems by this, that these vallare and Murell coronets were made of
some other matter than Silver and Gold. Yet Aul. Gell. lib. 5. cap. 6. writes
that both these, as also the Nauale, were of gold. Now, the VALLARE or
CASTRENSIS coronet, (for they were both one) resembled vall^ 1. the Rampire a
palaisade about a Camp, made ex vallis. 1. stakes or pales sharpened at the
head, wherewith the bank or mure was the better fortified* and he received it
as an honorable reward, who first mounted the said palaisade, and entered the
Camp of his enemies: The Murell, was fascioned like to the battlements of a
wall, given likewise unto that soldier, who approached the enemies wall first,
skaled, and climbed over it into the City. As for these Phaler^, albeit they
be commonly taken for the ornaments or trappings of horses, yet it appears
that they be the ornaments of the men themselves: And as well they as TO^QVES
were, Tralatitia militum dona. 1. Ordinary and common gifts bestowed upon good
soldiers. See Iuvenal. Satyr. ult. Vt l^ti phaleris omnes, and torquibus omnes.

( d) Such as he called before MANIPVLARES and GREGARIOS: although in other
authors, Caligati stand for all manner of soldiers.

( e) In Latin Festina lent: much to this sense in our English tongue. No more
have then good speed: For, The soft fire makes sweet malt. This proverb the
same AUGUSTUS expressed also in his coins, wherein he stamped together with
lightning or a thu^derbolt, the God TERMINVS, representing by the one,
Celeritie; and by the other, Strayednesse. Like as TITUS VESPASIANVS the
Emperor joined an Anchor and a Dolphin together in his coin, to the same
purpose.

( f) A verse of EURIPIDES, in the Tragedy Phoeniss^. 1. A wary Captain is
better than a venterous.

( g) It was the Apophthegme of CATO* Soon enough is that done, which is well
done. 26


( a) BY the law A^aria, that L. JULIUS, or VILLIVS rather promulged, required
it was, that a Consul should not be under the age of 43. Yet for their
worthiness and demerits, some attain to that dignity, under 30.

( b) Like unto this was the speech of that Centurion, who being lent by JULIUS
CAESAR Dictator, for to h^e the time of his government and conduct of an Army
in the province p^oroged, standing before the door of the Senate house, and
taking knowledge that it would not be granted, shook his sword hilt with his
hand and said, Hic prorogabit. 1. This then shall proroge it.

( a) THREE such Halles there were in Rome, 29
wherein Judicial courts were held, and causes pleaded. 1. Romanum, which was
so much frequented with Lawyers and their Clients, that CATO CENSORIVS
delivered his opinion, that it should be paved with Calthrops, to k^epe-out
that rabble which ha^ted it. 2. Caesareum, That CAESAR Dictator built, and
adjoined thereto the Temple of VENUS Genitrix. 3. AVGVSTI* whereto was annexed
by him one Temple of MARS Re^enger. For, another he erected in the Capitol,
after he had regained from the Parthians, the Roman Standerds and military
desoignes, which they won from CRASSVS.

( b) An Aphitheater, and a Theater, differs as ^he full Moon from the half,
or a complete rou^d^e from a semicircle.

( a) PLINY writes, that Rome was divided into 30
soureteene Regions, or wards, and into more than a thousand streets.

( a) Augurs were certain Priests employed about the observation of Birds, and
from them out of their learning gave directions. In number at first they were
but three belonging unto the three ancient tribes of Rome. In process of time
there was a College or covent of them to the number of 24. namely, in the
days of SVLLA Dictator: So that I doubt not but among these were some
appointed for this ministry either about the Goddess SALVS. 1. Health or
safety, unto whom there was likewise a Temple built, or else in the name and
behalf of the people, Captare Augurium salutis, which as DIO makes report,
was in this manner: That they should call unto God for safety, if he would
permit: as if it were not lawful to crave it at the Gods hands, unless they
first granted it. And one day every year was chosen for this buisinesse, in
which no Army did set forth to war: no man war against them, nor took
weapon in hand to fight. A thing that could not be, during the late troubles
and civil wars. No ^erveile therefore, if this function being forelet, was
now taken up again by AUGUSTUS, when by ^ccasion of peace, he did shut the
Temple of IANVS. And as this function was called Augurium, so I see no reason
but the very Augurship or Sacerdotall dignity it self in this place might be
named Augurium, in the same form, that presently after, the Flamenship or
Priesthood belonging to IVPITER, is named Flaminium: And this I take to be the
meaning of our Author.

( b) Which were solemnized once in an hundred, 31
or as some say, an hundred and ten years.

( a) BY which addition, there were in the year 32
230. Law-daies or pleadeable.

( a) MORE majorum ordained it was, that a Paricide, 33
should first be beaten with rods, and then* sowed within a lether male or
budge together with a dog, a coc^e, a viper, and an Ape, and so thrown into
the sea or some running water.

( b) Whereof CORNELIUS SYLLA was the Author entitled: de falsis, or
Testamentaria.

( a) MANY laws went under the title Sumptuariae, 34
to repress the immoderate expense in apparel, and belly-cheere especially:
as namely, Fa^ia, Di^ia Oppia* Cornelia, Iulia, as well Caesaris as Augusti,
But in the time of TIBERIUS CAESAR, notwithstanding he did what he could to
keep them in force, yet they were all abrogated.

( b) Lex Iulia, Caesaris and Augusti, de Adulteriis and Pudiciti^. For albeit
the law Sca^tiiia
Scatinia, provided against the later, to wit Paederestie, yet the penalty
thereof by virtue of the said law was but Pec^iaria, i. a money matter. Whereas
by Iulia it was Capitalls, i. worthy of death. And, that AUGUSTUS established
and enforced this law against Incontinencie, it may appear by this, That
Sextus Aurelius reproved him: because being himself given to lasciviousness,
yet he was a most severe and sharp chasticer of that vice: as also by that
answer of a young man, who^ he for committing adultery with his daughter Iulia
smote with his own hands. Who thereupon cried out (...). i. Thou have made a
law O CAESAR. Now as touching the foresaid law Scatinia, it was so called (as
VALERIVS MAXIMUS writes by occasion of one Scantinius
Scatinius a Tribune of the commons, who against kind had abused a son of
MARCELLVS, and was therefore condemned accordingly.

( c) De a^bitu. Of which there were divets, namely Acilia Calpurnia, A^fidia,
Baebia Aemilia, Cornelia Fulvia, Maria, Pompeia, Paetilia, Tullia and Iulia,
Caesaris and Augusti.

( d) Lex papia poppaea, de maritandis ordinibus, whereof, there were many
branches and chapters, not only respecting this conjunction of the Gentry and
commons: but also concerning penalties to be laid upon those that neglected
marriage, and rewards due to such as lived in wedlock and begat children, etc.

( a) The badges that distinguished Senators from 35
others, were their Robes purfled or embrodred or with broad studs of purple
like nail heads, called thereupon Laticlavi, and shoes with ^peakes resembling
the horned tips or pointed ends of the moon, named therefore Calcei lunati, in
token of their ancient Nobility, as some interpret it.

( b) These solemn feasts at which Senators were allowed to be present, were
Epulum ovic otherwise called Cana Dialis within the capitol: Likewise Cana
Trivmphalis Pontificialis, and Auguralis. i. the sumptuous suppers to the
honor of IVPITER, at triumphs, given by the Pontifies and Augurs.

( c) The first day of every month. The 13 of March, May, July, and October,
the 15 of the rest.

( a) A judicial court there was at Rome called 37
Cent^vir alia Hasta, for that it consisted of certain Commissioners or Judges
named Cent^viri, i. The Hundred-men. Before whom were debated civil matters
and causes between citizen and citizen, of no great importance. Chosen these
were out of eve^le Tribe thr^. And those were in all 35. which number does
arise to 105. but in round reckoning they went for an hundred.

( a) What these or naments and badges were. T. 38
LIVIVS reports in the 30 book of his Roman history: to wit, A crown of
Gold, and a fair golden B^ll: A curule, I vorie chair, with a staff likewise
or scepter of Ivory: A long Robe embrodered of sundry colors, and a rich
coat of Needl^ work^ representing the Date tree.

( b) This solemn show or Riding of Roman Gentlemen, was upon the Ides i. the
15 day of Quintilis alias July yearly: Instituted first by FABIVS RVTILIANVS
in the honor of CASTOR and POLLVX, who appeared unto the Romans, at the
battle near the Lake Regillus, what time they atchived a noble victory. They
rode from the Temple of Honor, as some write, or as others, of Man without the
walls, through the Forum, and by the Temple of Castor, up into the Capital,
dight with chaplets of Olive branches, as PLINY writes lib. 15. Nature. Hist.

( a) BY this it appears, that ordinarily he might 4^
not be a Tribune of the commons, who was not a Senator: For albeit this be a
Plebian Magistrate, yet might a commoner be a Senator.

( b) Whereupon, SVIDAS thinks, Annenas to take their name, quasi (...) i.
because corn was wont to be dealt among the people, upon the Nones of every
month, namely, the seventh day of March, May, July and October, and the fifth
of the rest: Whereas indeed Annon^ is derived ab a^o, i. the year, quasi
annalis alimonia. i. the years provision of food.

( c) It seems that AUGUSTUS held of two Tribes: to wit, Scaptia, unto which
the Octarij belonged, and wherein he was borne: and Fabia, by his adoption into
the family of the Iulij.

( d) For, howsoever the Roman habit was the Gown, yet permitted were they,
upon necessity, namely to save the said gown in foul wether, or to defend
themselves from cold, to cast over it a cloak in any frequented place of the
City, as were the Forum, i. The common pleading court, ward, or Market place,
and the Circus, i. The Show place.

( a) FOR the ordinary Roman Gowns were 44
white and fair kept.

( b) Of these spectacles and games, some were Matutini, some Meridiani, and
other Pomeridiani: according as they were exhibited, In the morning, at Noone,
and afternoon.

( a) These were called likewise sacred Games, as 45
Stage Plays, Gymnicke Exercises, and Masteries in Music, in NEROES time.

( b) They took that name of a spacious Gallerie or walking place called
Xystos, wherein they were wont to exercise in winter time.

( a) COLONIES, were Towne-ships in Italy and other Provinces planted with
Roman Inhabitants. 46
In which, Decuriones as one would say Aldermen, had the same authority as
Senators in Rome.

( a) HEREUPON, some Provinces were called 47
Caesari^, or Praesidiariae: namely which were ruled by the Emperors sole
appointment, and had strong Garrisons placed in them: others, Populi, and they
were named (...), Consulares, or Proconsul^s, governed by Pretors, Consuls, or
their Vice geren^. 50


( a) There is a kind of Munkey or Marmoset in Aethi^pia, going under the name
of Sphinx, in PLINY The Poets also feign, that a certain monsterous beast so
called, sometimes did haunt the City of Thebes and the Te^torie about it:
Which from a rock proposed ridales unto the passengers. This monster by their
report, carried the resemblance of three creatures, to wit, a Foul, A Lion, and
a maiden, according to these verses of Ausoni^.

Terruit Aoniam volucri^, Leo, virgo, triformis
Sphinx: volu^ris penna, pedibus fera, front puella. Le^.

A three-shap'd Sphinx, Bird Lion-Maid, Aonian land did fright,
In wing a foul, in feet a * beast, Lion
In face a virgin [bright].
PLINY writes in the last book of his Natural History. That AUGUSTUS used
at the beginning to sign with this Sphinx engraven upon his Signet. And verily
quoth he, in the casket of his mothers lewels two of these he fouud, so like,
that one could not be discerned from the other. And as he was wont to wear
the one wheresoever he went, so in his absence during the civil wars with
A^thonie, his friends that menaged his affairs at Rome, sealed with the other,
those missives and edicts which passed in his name. And from hence it came,
that those who received any such letters or edictes containing matter of
difficulty, were wont merrily to say, that the said Sphinx came ever with some
hard riddle or other, which could not be a^oiled Whereupon AUGUSTUS to avoid
the obloquit that arose by his Sphinx gave over sealing therewith, and signed
always after with the image of King ALEXANDER the Great, etc.

( a) This humanity and affable courtesy termed by SVETON. CIVILITAS, was
reproved in 51
ALEXANDER the Emperor by his mother and wife both, as not beseeming the
Majesty of a Prince* For they told him many times, that thereby he caused his
Imperial power and digniue to be the more contemptible: Yea, but it is by that
means quoth he both surer, and like also to last the longer Lamprid in
Alexandro.

( a) THIS name Dominus among the Romans, 53
like as S^r with us, was d^uersly used. In the sense of imperious and Lordly
command, as we sometime take [Lord] it was odious: as having a relation to
SERVVS a slave or villain. To moll^fie therefore the ha^shnesse of the word,
they used to term householders or masters of families, patre^familias, in steed
of Dominos, as also household servants familiare^, and not serv^s. Otherwise
they used it by way of flattery or fair speech* as appears in the chap. 21.
of CLAUDIUS following. Hence it is, that lovers call their sweet hearts, Do^ i.
Mistresses. Also if a man speaks unto one, whom he either knows not, or
has forgotten he says, Do^ine. i. Here you Sir, according to that Epigram in
Martial.

Cum te non nossem, Dominum Regemque (...),

Al while that I you kenned not, I called you L* and King Or sir.


Last of all, by way of scorn and derision. And so, the same Martial
testifyeth in this Distichon.

Cum voco te dominum ^litibi, Cinna, placere,
Sepe etiam servum sic resalut^ meum.
When I O Cinna call you ^ir joy not, I you address,
For even my servant I salute often times no otherwise.
In which manner we speak unto our servant, or any other in contempt, by this
term firrha: to say nothing of sir knave. No mervaile therefore, if AUGUSTUS
could not abide this word Domin^ so doubtfully taken, and seldom in good sense.

( b) If you read, [ adoperta] i. close and shut, it may have reference to
this, That he took not state upon him, not sought the peoples applause: which
accords to his other behavior reported before. If, [ ad aperta] ^* open, it
shows likewise his courteous carriage and affability: as who was ready to
accept of petitions and requests: a thing right commendable in a Prince, as it
is written of King ARTAXERXES surnamed MNEMON, how riding in a Carroch with his
Queen, he commanded her to draw open the curtains thereof, That he might the
better attend upon his subjects. And this agrees as well with that which
follows of AUGUSTUS. And hereto I rather incline.

( c) He looked not for their attendance at home in his own house, neither
would he be thought to have conferred with any one privately, as touching the
public affairs.

( d) It is generally a received opinion, that within seven natural days such
voluntary abstinence from food is not mortal, as PLINY writes in his
eleventh book, who reports also, that many have con^nued tasting more than
eleven days. Which I easily beeleeve. For, in mine own knowledge I may be
bold to report, that a Bitch lived so long, and yet died not, nor miscarried the
whelps within her. Some meloncholicke persons therefore, may within the
Latitude of Health endure so long, yea and those likewise who are fraught
top-full with a balla^se of cr^d and cold humors, which may engender a
quartaine ague as well as melancholy does. For, I doubt not, but in such
chronicke diseases occasioned and maintained by gross matters, one may abide
above eleven days without all manner of food. Yet AVLVS GELLIVS says, that
beyond seven days wilful abstinence, a man is not able to live.

( a) For, as Vlpian testifyeth. l. 18. de Testa^nt. 55
A law there was, that whosoever to the infamy of any person published a
Libell either in his own or another man's name, yea without name at all. If he
be convict thereof, shall be Intestabilis. i. disabled both for making a will
himself, and also for to be a witness unto another man's.

( a) By these Candidates, ^e means either such 56
as himself recommended unto the people for any office, as CAESAR his
predecessor did before him, and those were called Caesaris Candidati, or else
his especial friends whom he labored for.

( b) PLINY lib. 35. cap. 12. writes, that Cassi^s his accuser charged him to
have killed 130. guestes, with one platter of poisoned meat.

( c) Certain soldiers there were going under the name of Scutarii, as PAVLVS
DIACONVS witnesses in his supplement upon (...) writing that Valentinian of a
Tribune or Colonel over these Scutari, became Emperor.

( a) GERMANICVS was the son of Drusus, 64
and Antonia the younger. Now, had Drusus for his mother, Livia the wife of
Augustus and Antonia for hers, (...) the sister of Augustus.

( b) In all bargains of sale, and alienations, the solemn and ceremonial
form at Rome was this, that five witnesses at the least, Roman Citizens and
of lawful age, with one other beside, of the same condition called Libripens,
(because he held a pair of balances, etc.) the chapman or buyer should come
with a piece of Brass coin in his hand, and say, (for example sake, if it
were a bondslave to be bought and sold) these words, This man or woman,
Iavouch by the law of the Romans to be mine, and bought I have him or her, for
this piece of brass, and with this brazen balance, and therewith, sttiking
the said balance give the brazen piece unto the other party that is the
seller, By which imaginary kind of chasse* ring, things were alienated, and
their property changed.

( c) So ordinary it was to train up youth in swimming, reading and writing.
and in * Grammar, of which the one had relation to the exercise of the body,
the other of the mind, that of such as had no bringing up at all, arose this
proverb, (...).

( a) CAIUS was sent by AUGUSTUS with an army to suppress the troubles and
insurrections in the East-parts: where he was stabbed treacherously, with a
knife or short skeene, by one who presented unto him a supplication, of which
wound he died afterward. A. LUCIUS likewise he sent into Armenia, reco^mending
him unto the Gods in these words, that they would vouchsafe him as welbeloved
as Pompeius, as ^alorous as King Alexander, and as fortunate as himself.

( a) These he adopted, because they were out of the tuition of their fathers
deceased) in the common Hall or Forum, before the high priests, and with
consent of the people, by virtue of the law Curiata, And this was properly
called Adoption. Whereas, suff^cient it was to adopt others above named with the
assent of their fathers, by the formal bargain of sail called Mancipatro.

( c) Certain questours there were named also Candidati Principis: whose
Office it was to read such missives or letters in the Senate.

( d) Happily, this he did to know thereby, whether she had been naught of her
body with them or no? considering we learn out of natural Philosophy, that
commonly children resemble their parents in complexion, favor, and marks.
Howbeit, this Iulia is reported to have brought forth children, all like unto
M. Aegri^pa, her husband so long as he lived, notwithstanding she was known to
be a common strumpet But beside her answer to that point, unto those who made
a wonder at it, which ye may see in Ma^rob. Saturnal. li^. 2. cap. 5. read the
pleasant and witty Epigram of Sir Thomas Moore, upon the like example.

( e) Alluding to a place of Homere, Iliad. 3. wherein Hector curses his
brother Caris, and after some approbrious terms says thus,

(...).

Would God, thou ha^'st of women never be^e borne:
Or else had died thy wedding day befor^e.
Which verse, by inversion of words and using one of them in a contrary sense,
AUGUSTUS transferred unto his own person. For it is to be noted, that (...)
here in Ho^er has a passive signification, and sounds, as much, as (...),
i. not borne, whereas AUGUSTUS takes it in the active, for one that is
childlesse, or * has begotten no children. or is unable for (...)


( f) These Cancers be certain tumors or swellings, hard and unequal of their
nature which he called Scirrhes, and of an ugly, aspect, as arising from
unnatural melancholy, breeding, as CORNELIUS CELSVS writes, for the most part
in the superior region of the body, about the face, nose, ears, lips, and
women's breasts. Which our Author here and the Greek writers name Carcinomata,
for the resemblance of the Crab-fish crooked cleies, which the black or swart
veins all about them do represent, or because they be hardly or uneth
remooved, if they once take to a place, no more than the said fish when it
setleth to a thing and claspeth it, Untoward to be healed, and commonly the
worse for all the cure done unto them. These Cancers, if they become ulcers
once are termed Wolves. In regard of which properties, aptly compared AUGUSTUS
those ungracious Impes of his breed, unto them, as being foul Eyesores,
disteining his honor, and by no discipline of his corrigible.

( a) According to that sage precept of Selon, (...). 66
i. Be not hasty making any thy friends and the saying of Hecuba in Euripides,

(...).

No friend, I say,
Who loves not eye.
Which two rules Properti^s elegantly comprehends in one verse, Amare.

Noc cito desis^o, nec temere i^cipio

Late ere I love, as long ere I leave.

( b) AESOPE gave this lesson, (...). i. Commit no secrets to a woman. And as
for this M^cenas, he was noted to be Vxorius, more than he should, and one, who
(albeit his wife was a shrew and ready to go from him every day soon
admitted attonements and reconciliations. Whereupon Seneca in his moral
Epistles said, That having but one wife, yet he married a thousand times.

( a) EVERY word almost in this verse carries a 6^
double construction without the understa^ding whereof, all the grace is lost.
For, Cyn^dus in one sense, betokens one of the Galli, Priests of the Gods
Cybele named also, Ops Matter deum, and Tellus, even the very Earth. Which
priests were gelded or disabled for generation, and took that name of the
river Gallus, the water whereof drunken, caused men to be evirate and
effeminate. Now, the manner of these priests in the divine service of the said
goddess, was to beat the Taber or tamper upon the Timbril, which is expressed
here in these words, Orbem digito temperat. For that the Timbrill is round and
circular, to signify the Globe of the earth symbolyze by Cybele. And in this
sense, may the verse literally be interpreted: But, beside this signification,
Cyn^dus betokneth a wanto^ Pathick or (...), who suffers himself against
nature to be abused Orbis also is put, for the habitable world, and digito
temperat, is as much to say, as He has the world at a beck, or at his
comma^nd, as if the same were ruled by AUGUSTUS CAESAR, who was noted for that
abominable filthiness. And in this latter sense did the people of Rome
expound the said verse, and apply it unto him. 70


(a) OF twelve Gods and Goddesses together: Alluding to those six select Gods,
and as many Goddesses whom antiquity in heathenesse honored above, the rest:
whose names ENNIVS the Poet comprised in these two verses,

I^no, vefia, Minerva, Ceres, Diana, Venus, Mars,
Mercurius Jupiter.
Iovis, Neptunus, Vnlcanus, Apollo.
Answerable to which number he entertained six young women attired like
Goddesses, and six boys ( lataemites) in habit of Gods, as his guests at this
Supper.

( b) I doubt, the first verse of this Hexasticon is not perfect, for, I do
not please my self in the translation of it.

( c) Neither is it certain what this Mallia should be? Some read Manlia, as
if it were the name of a chamber within the Lastell or Citadyll of the
Capital, which this banqu^ting place of his did counterfeit, and then we must
admit the figure (...). Others take Mallia to be the name of some woman, im
ploied in the furnishing and setting out of such a supper

( d) For AUGUSTUS not only sat here among the rest in the person of Apollo,
but also would sometimes be thought Phoebus, otherwhiles Phoebus his son.

( e) For, it is not unknown what adulteries the Poets talk of, between
Jupiter and Arm^nia etc. between Mars also and Venus.

( f) No marvel, if Jupiter Capitolinus, with other Gods and Goddesses, being
before possessed of the Capital, abandoned their shrines and chapels, when
they saw such in place.

( g) Wherein Tormentors whips and scourges were to be fold: and there-upon he
took that name of Tortour (like as before he is surnamed Sandaliarius, and
Trag^dus) which, AUGUSTUS seemed now to verify in himself, whipping and
plauging the people with hunger, as he did.

( a) IN which month the feast Saturnalia was 71
kept, and much liberty tolerated of gaming, feasung and ^eveling.

( b) In this game called in Latin Lusus talorum, or Talarius, there is some
resemblance of our dies, but that the Tali have but four faces or sides, and
therefore yield four chances and no more. Of which the first is named Canis
or Can^cula, answering as some think to our Ace, and is the worst of all. The
opposite unto it, they termed Venus or Cous, and is accounted the best, as
which may stand for our (...). The third bare the name of Chius, proportioned
to Trey with us and the last S^nio, and is as much as Quatre. For in these Tal^
or cockall bones threre is no chance of Deux or Cinque.

( c) Quinquatrus or Quinquatria, were certain festival holidaies held for
five days together in the month March to the honor of Minerra. See Ovid d^
Fast. Var. Macro. Aul. Gell.

( a) FOR pleasure therein he called it Syracus^, 72
comparing it to that beautiful City in Sicily, and because it served his
turn for meditations and invetions, he gave it the name (...).

( a) Employed, as it should seem in his civil 74
wars. Certain soldiers there were attending upon the Prince under the name
of (...), whole service he used, in spying and listening, In Greek such were
named, (...) and (...). Also in doing execut^on upon cond^mned persons, and in
sending of letters unto the Senate, as (...) Torrentius has observed very
well in his Annotations upon CAIUS CALIGVLA. 66


( a) Sabbatis Ieiunium servat. If Sabbats be but for weeks, as the manner of
the Jews was to speak, according as the Publicane says in the Gospel after
Saint Luke, (...), and as it appears in other places of the Evangelists, true
it is, that SVETONIVS or AUGUSTUS reports of the Jews, as also if by
Sabbaths are meant other of their festival and solemn days. But if you take
i^ for the seventh or last day of the week, it is altogether untrue, and to be
imputed unto the (...) and ignorance of SVETONIVS and the Romans, in the
Jewish rites and ceremonies. For seeing them religiously to keep the said
seventh day or Sabbat holy, whereupon they were commonly called Sabbatarii, and
observing withal their fasting, generally it was thought of strangers that
they fasted upon the Sabbat. Also for their devout fasting against the feast of
the Passover, called by themselves sometime the great Sabbat, as also by
forainers, as it appears by Horat us lib. 1. sermon. sat. 9. in this piece of
verse Hod^e trices^ma Sablata, etc. they imagined that the Jews fasted every
Sabbat. And in truth, reckon from September (at which month the Jews in one
computation begin their year) 30 weeks forward, you come unto their Cascha:
According to which (...) we Christians also do celebrate our feast of Easter.
This only is the difference between us and them, for that they observe the
Neomenia or new moo^e at the spring Aequinex, and solemnize their passover in
the next full moon, and we, the Lords day or Sunday after the said full.

( a) It seems, he took but a light repast: not 78
putting off his shoes, as the manner was, at full meals.

( b) Some copies have, retectis pedibus, making ( re) to be (...), as if he
meant, very well covered (contrary to the use of that word retegere, which
otherwise signifies, to uncover) like as rec^ndere, i. to lay up very safe
and sure. Others, retractis i. with his feet somewhat drawn or pulled up to
him: in the same sense as CORNELIUS CELSVS uses paulum reductis, qui fere
jacentibus babitus est, as he says, which is the ordinary form of lying,
when as men be in health. Lastly, some read, re^ectis i. Let down or stretched
out to the full (...).

( c) CASABONVS interprets, ^ Lecticulam lucubratoriam] a pallet or low bed
made for the nones, to rest and study upon.

( a) BY whose report, he wanted not much of the full height of men, to wit,
nere six foot, according to Vegetius. 79
Above which Stature the grouth is somewhat giantlike. 80


( a) AD Impetiginis formam. The second kind whereof, as CORNELIUS CELSVS
writes, (for willingly do I often cite him as the Roman Galene, in explication
of a Roman writer) Varias figuras habet i. resembles many and sundre forms.
lib. 5. cap. 28.

( b) This infirmity of his was a kind of gout, which the Greek writers call
Isch^as, and is commonly named Sciatica. As for the (...) or palliatiue cure
rather (for easement o^ pain) with sand: It may be meant either of some
^omentations with linen bags wherein was sand. For, Cornelius Caesar
writes, That (...) seed, salt, and sand, or any of them put within a linen
cloth, and so applied to the affected place, cure the said disease: or of
walking in sand by the sea side, or elle of tumbling and wallowing therein:
Which remedy Q. Serenus (...) in this verse: Nec non and tepidis conuoluere
corpus arenis, etc. has prescribed and experience verified.

( ^) CATO in his Husbandry, and PLINY lib. 17. cap. vltimo, makes mention
of cu^ing the Sciatica with a clift of agreen cane or reed, but there must be
forsooth, a charm go with all, and so, it reposeth (...) or bones out of
joint. Indeed, both Di^, and also (...), attribute unto the rind or bark of
Cane roots, and to their as^es (...) desiccatiue virtue: Whereby, they are
found good for such dislocation^, and ^o may cure the Articular disease
likewise, called Sciatica, which differs not much from a dislocation, of the
huckle-bone.

( d) PLINY reports 3. cap. lib. 25. That the (...) of the bladder, and
especially the Strangurie, i. (...) drop-meale, occasioned by gravel, (which I
take here to be meant) is of all others most dolorous.

( a) THIS accords to an observation of Cornelius 81
Cells. Qui secundis aliquando frustra curatus est, contrariis aliquando
restituitur. 1. The patient whose cure devised by art, and according to the
rule of Physic, sometime speedeth not well, recouereth otherwhile by a course
of means quite contrary.

( b) Which the Greeks call Periodicall: As the Quartane Ague and other (...)
fevers be so termed because their fits return upon certain da^es. The falling
sickness likewise, keeping time with the moon, whereupon some name it Lunat.
cus. And gouts, which are most busy in the spring and the fall, etc.

( c) Toward the end of September. An unequal season of the year, wherein
commonly, the mor^ings and evenings be cold, and the Noone (...) hot, whereby
many diseases are occasioned. But as touching the Birthday here mentioned,
Valerius Max and P^inie report. That Anti^ater S^donius the Poet every year
upon the day of his Nativitie only felt the access of an Ague. Whereof he
died in the end, after he had lived to a great age.

( a) No marvel (...) in cacochymicall bodies, such as his was, the humors
which lay still and quiet all Winter, began to spread and swell in the spring
causing Distentions and Ventosities: especially in that place where they were
gathered and laid up as it were in store, to do a mischief when the time came.

( a) FAEMINALIEVS and tibialibus. In steed 82
of our Breeches and Stockings, the Greeks and (...), used ^n those days
certain loose clothes in manner of (...) hands to cover and lap their (...).
And long it was, ^re they took to any such, (...) it were upon occasion of

to let down his upmost garment for to hide his shame* JULIUS CAESAR (...)
himself, being deadly wounded, was careful to let fall the lap of his which
usually was cast over the shoulder.
gown for to cover his privy parts when he should fall. In process of time
they took to wearing the clothes aforesaid in lieu of (...). 1. Breeches,
which the French and other barbarous Nations used: but they did so in Winter
only. For, otherwise they went ordinarily in those parts without t^usses:
covering all as mannerly as they could with their loose upper garment, which
upon a small occasion were ready to fly open.

( b) Partly, to make a noise, and so to procure sleep, and in part to refresh
and cool the Air.

( c) As well to cool him as to drive away gnats, for want of curtains or a
canopie, which thereof took the name in Greek (...) or (...) Now the manner
of this (...) or making wind was for the better and daintier sort, with plumes
of peacocks tails, much like to the (...) of feather^ used in these days as
well as in old time, but for the meaner, with beasts tails.

( d) From Rome to Praeneste or T^bur, is about one hundred Stadia if then, you
reckon 125. pases to a Stadium, it comes to 12. miles and an half. CATO
CENSORIVS was of another mind, who said he Repented when soever he went to any
place by water if he might, by land.

( e) The abstinence whereof in some measure is good for those that have feeble
joints, and be remembered otherwhiles with any gout, as AUGUSTUS was yet a thing
that Physicians in old time could hardly bring their patients unto, so
ordinary it was in those days to both.

( f) Which, the wanton and delicate Ladies of Rome, as PLINY writes, used of
silver. 83


( a) AD pilam. Whereas there were diverse kinds of bals to play with, it
seems, that he means in this place that, which of all other was least and
hardest, as being stuffed with hair, whereupon it took the name: the same no
doubt that our Tennis Ball is sent to and fro with the Racket. Named likewwise
it was Trigonalis, of a Tennis court within the baines, three square walled:
from which walls the ball did rebound. Of this ball, and the exercise thereof,
GALEN wrote a Treatise.

( b) Folliculum. By Folliculus is meant a kind of wind hand ball covered with
lether: having within it a bladder puffed up with wind, the softest and
lightest of all others, smitten, not with a racket as the other, not with the
palm of the hand, as that which they called Paga^ica, filled with woole,
flocks or yarne, but driven with the dutched fist, whereupon it took the name
PVGILLATORIA.

( e) So TVRNE^VS expounds it. But ISAACVS CASAVEONVS understands thereby,
Segestrie or Segesirium, in Greek (...), a light blanquet or quilt.

( d) By this, is meant a play, that children used, and not that game of hazard
resembling dice, at which, he said before, they played (...).

( ^) For ought that I can gather out of the sundry conjectures of expositours,
these Ocellati made of silver or Iron, resemble the game of young Gentle women
called of some Trol-Mad^e: or else that pastime of boys named nin^ holes.

( a) BESIDES the pretty allusion unto the fabulous 85
history of AIA^, TORRENTIVS has observed in the word Spongia, a double
signification: to wit, a sponge called Deletilis, which writers had at hand,
either to wipe and wash out what misliked them, or to blur^e and blot the same,
according to these of the Poet AVSONIVS.

Aut ^ctis parit^r ^erfibus obli^at
Futram lacticolor spongia sepiam.
Whereupon Martialis says of it, Vtilis h^c quoties scripta novare voles. and
also a sword. Which adds the better grace unto the conceit, considering that
AJAX fell upon his own sword. But in this latter sense, I have not yet found
Spongia taken, in any approved author.

( a) AUGUSTUS taxed MAECENAS for being 86
Cacozelos, and found as much fault with TIRERIVS, because he was Antig^arius.

( b) By these words (...) Cincinnos AUGUSTUS noreth the affectate forced
phrases, and curious ynkehorne terms as it were, of MAECENAS, Cuius oration, as
SENECA reports of him Epist. 94. aeque soluta est, ^c ipse discinctus. His
manner of style might be compared to those hairs of his, curled with crisping
pins and besmered with odoriferous oiles, which CICERO calls cap^lles
calamistrates and delibutes. Neither do I think that AUGUSTUS rereprehendeth
MARCENAS for using these words, (...) cincinnos, because it is his own manner
in writing to enterlace Greek with Latin, and besides, Carozel^ is therein to
be found. But his over curious terms and new devised phrases he so calls,
for that MAECENAS was wont in trimming and tricking up himself to be somewhat
womannish.

( c) AUGUSTUS in a certain Epistle unto Macenas by expressing his own nice
and delicate phrases, after a sort derideth them, and dehorteth him thereto, in
these words. Vale ^el (...) Medulli^ ebur ex Hetruria, laser Aretinum, adames
supernas, Tiberinum Margaritum, Cilniorum Smaragde, Iaspi figulorum, Berylle
P^rcenne, carbunculum Italiae, (...) Maecharum. In which words, as in a mirror
he might see himself.

( d) As if he should say, Never a barrel better herring. There was neither of
them better than other, as offending both ways. The Asiatick Orators were
Cacogel^, Ci^ber Atticus and V^ranius, Antiquaris. So that, it was mere folly
and vanity to make any doubt, whether of them to imitate, being all stark
naught.

( a) This SPHAERVS was a deep Scholar and great 89
Humanitian as we speak, and whom the Greeks call Philologo^. Under him
AUGUSTUS became (...) i. skillful in history, Antiquities etc. like as, under
A^EVS he learned Philosophy.

( b) The principal Authors whereof HORATIVS comprised in this verse.

E^polis atque Cratin^ Aristophanesque po^ta.

In this manner of Comedy the vices of men and women were represented and
taxed upon the stage over-boldly, and bravely to their discredit. For which it
grew to be offensive, and was laid away a long time.

( c) Who was Censor in his time, and persuaded in his orations that al men of
what degree soever should be compelled to marie for procreation of children. 90


( ^) PLINY lib. 2. cap. 55. Not. Hist. writes, that it never ligh^neth above
five foot within the ground. Fearful persons therefore think such deep caves
most safe. 91


( ^) BY this custom and gesture, as the Argument and circumstance of the
place naturally imports, he thought to entreat the goddess Ne^isis for to
spare him: N^esis I say, whom the Hea^ en^n agined to attend with an envicus
eye, upon all excessive prospori^ie. To avoid therefore adverse afterclaps,
which this sp^tefull goddess might bring upon him, unless they were pacified,
AUGUSTUS thus debased himself superstitiously, and in some sort, seemed to
abridge his own felici^e. Much after the manner of POLYCRATES that rich tyrant
who to be excused from this Nemesis, fl^ng into the sea a lewel, with a
precious stone of inestimable price. 92


( a) NVNDINAE among the Romans were those days in every month. Whereon they
kept fayres and markets. It should seem therefore, that he held the day after
them ominous and of unlucky presage, as we say in our proverb, A day after the
fair, or else because he had sometime not sped very well, when as he did set
out in his journey upon such a day.

( b) No^is, quasi, non is, which literal^y osseth as much as, you go not. Much
like to that in Pliny 15. lib. cap. 19. When M. Crassus was ready to embarke
in that unfortunate expedition into Parthia where he was slain, a fellow cried
certain figs to be sold with this note Cauneas, Canneas (for of that kind
were those figs) which ossed thus much unto him, as if in short speech he had
cried cave ne eas, cave ne eas, 93
i. Take heed you go not this voyage.

( a) AN Idol resembling an Ox, which the Egyptians worshipped as a God for
Serapis.

( b) He did this, as it should seem in policy, because he would not be
thought addicted to the Jewish sect. For otherwise it appears as well by
hisgracious Indulgences granted unto them, as his own testimony in Edicts and
commissio^s, wherein he gives unto their God [the true and only God] the
attribute of (...), and instituted for ever certain Holocausts, or whole burnt
offerings, to wit, two lambs and one bull, to be offered unto that sovereign
and most high Diety. 94


( a) SOME have expounded this of our Savior Chist, King, not of Rome only,
but also of all the world, who took our nature upon him, and was borne in the
days of Augustus Caesar.

( b) The like conception by a serpent is reported of Olympi^s the mother of
king ALEXANDER the great, of POMPONIA likewise the mother of SCIPIO AFRICANVS.

( c) This broad seal wherewith were signed letters Patents and other public
Instruments, carried a stamp representing the City of Rome: and beingthus put
into his bosom, prefigured that he one day should have the government of the
state and commonweal.

( d) Symbolizing thereby, that the Citizens of Rome, who before time mightnot
lawfully be scourged were in danger to loose their liberty in that behalf.

( a) Or, when he stood the first time for to be 95
Consul. For, the manner was of the Candidats or Competitours of the
Consulship, the night before the Election day to lie without the City abroad
in the open air: and afterward early in the morning to sit in a chair made
of one entier piece within the precinct of a certain place therefore appointed
(which thereupon was called Templum) and there, to wait and expect until some
God presented unto them a good and fortunate sign.

( a) CVM a^geri bostias imperasset.] The manner 96
was of the Pain^s if they could not speed of their Gods favor at the first
sacrifice, to kill more beasts still, until they saw some tokens thereof:
which in the Southsayers learning was called Lit^. Thus did PAVLVS AENILIVS for
20 together, and obtained no warrant of happy success before he had slain
the one and twentieth. Yet some write, that Sacrifices are then said Augeri,
when together with the beasts, there is use of Salsa ^la, i. meat and salt.
Which kind of Oftes be called Macta, quasi, magis auct^.

( b) Significant names both, and osses of victory. EVTICHVS, imports Luckie
or Fortunate: Nicon Victour or Conqueror.

( a) This solemnity of purging the Army every five years was instituted by
King SERVIVS TVLLVS, 97
and celebrated with the Sacrifice of a Swine, a Sheep and a Bull, named there
upon Suo^taurilia. Hereupon, the revolution of five years, they called
Lustrum. This function or office belonged afterward to Generals of the field:
like as the Expiation and purging of the people unto the Censours. And this
manner of Lustrum is here meant. Carol. Sig^. Asc^n.

( b) Writings or Instruments signed, containing the said vows: whereby they
bound themselves, as it were, by obligation to pay and perform the same.
Oftentimes also they fastened them with wax unto the knees of those Gods or
Idols unto whom they nuncupated those vows, according to that verse of
I^renal. Satyr. ^

Propter qu^ fas est genu^ incerare Deorum.

( c) Praeter consuetudine^.] SVETONIV^ seems here to forget himself,
writing that Augustus contrary to his old wont embarked by night, having
reported before, that it was his manner so to do. Torrentius would salve all,
expounding it thus, that his hasty and long journey (for it was a good stretch
from Astura to Beneventum) was contrary to his wonted manner. But to speak,
what I think, his journey now by night, was occasioned by a gale of wind that
served well for Benev^ntum, and has no reference at all to his accustomed
travail. Some would read, ( pro consuetudin^) i. after his usual manner, but
they respect not the scope of our Author, whose purpose in this place is to put
down certain particulars that were ominous and presaging his death. Among
which, this may be reckoned for one, That he did a thing now, repugnant to his
ordinary guise. A point, I wis, observed too much even now a days by those
that are superstitiously given. Although, I am not ignorant, that of this
observation, in sick fo^ke, there may be a natural reason tendered out of
Physic.

( a) DE naui Alexandrina. By Navis he means 98
as I suppose, ^assis (by the trope Synecdocie) i. the whole fleet, like as by
the same figere, ciassis signifies a ship. For one vessel alone arrived nor
into that haven of Pute^li, fraught with merchandise, considering that the same
is by other (...) named (...), and Co^eatus. Yea, and by the figure (...),
Martial calls is Niliacus (...), which properly betokens the fleet when it
is arrived. Neither is it like that Mariners and Passengers out of one ship
only saluted AUGUSTUS in this wise.

( b) Quadragenes (...). Every such piece was worth fifteen shillings starling
and better, aunswerable to our Spur Roials.

( c) These commodities were thought to be Drugs and Spices of all sorts, webs
or clothes in Say, Books, Paper, Glasses of sundry fashions, teere of flax,
hirds, or Tow, sindall or fine l^nen, twisted yarne and thread of diverse
colors, Babylonian and Egyptian cloth, well favored bondslaves, and of good
education, etc.

( d) Vicinam capreis insiclam.] Yet some read otherwise, Vicinam capreas
insulam ^. The Island Caprea near adjoining, as if AUGUSTUS had abode all this
while in the skirt and coast of Campania, or in some other of the neighbor
Islands. But I incline rather to the former exposition.

( e) The City of Ease and Idleness.

( f) This MASGA^AS, seems by his name to have been an Africane, whom
AUGUSTUS had made Constable as it were of that place, and ruler over a
Company, that he sent thither to dwell, after he had purchased it of the
Neapolitanes. And for that AUGUSTUS had in mirth given him the name of Founder,
he was so reputed, and his years mind after his death solemnized accordingly.

( g) Morbo varia^te. I take it, he means that which C^lsus calls Alvum
variam, and other Physicians Egestiones varias, namely when in a flux the
excrements and humors be of diverscolours, an argument that nature is not able
to concoct them being so irrigular, and therefore, sometimes a deadly figure. Or,
it may be expounded thus, That other whiles he seemed to be better and on the
mending hand, and thereupon more ven^erous. Then read, Mor be variante tamen,
etc.

( h) Celebrated every five years after the Grecian manner, and called
Gymnicke, because the mastenes therein, were performed by Champions for their
better agilitie well near naked.

( a) This was a special honor and indulgence 100
granted by a singular privilege, for otherwise it was against the custom and
laws of the Romans to bring a dead body into a sacred place, or into the
City, for fear of polluting and profaining it.

( b) The Senators and Gentlemen of Rome wore rings of Gold, the Commoners of
Iron

( c) The chief Colleges and Societies, at this time were compted four, that
is to say. The Pontifies or chief Priests, the Augures, the Septe^-virs, or
seven wardens called Ep^lones, for that to the^ belonged the charge of
providing the sacred feasts, the sumptuous suppers of the Pontifies, named
Coe^a adjiciales, as also the stately Tables, in the honor of Jupiter and
other Gods, and fourthly, of the Quind eci^virs, sacris faci^dis. i. Fifteen
overseers of the Sacrifices. Afterward adjoined there was to these a fifth,
Augustalium Sodalium, erected by order from AUGUSTUS, and others in process of
time by his precede^.

( d) This Rostra was the public pulpit for Orations, standing in the common
Market place, called Forum Romanu^: so called for that it was beautified with
the beake-heads of ships (named in Latin, Rostrae) which in a memorable fight
at Sea, the Romans won from their enemies. Near unto which were certain
shops called Veteres Tabern^: and absolutely veteres, for distinction of
others, known by the name of Nouae. i. the new shops. Yet some are of opinion,
that in this place our Author means Rostra veteres. i. the old pulpit: to
put a difference between it and another named Novae i. the New.

( e) You must think, That the dead body to be burnt in a funeral fire, was
set therein so, as the ashes and bones thereof remained a part by themselves
from the rest. Otherwise, the ashes of wood, the bones likewise of horses and
other beasts sometimes burnt therewith, should have the honor due unto the
said dead corpse. Some are of opinion that it was lapped in a linen sheet of
the f^axe called Asbeston, which would not be consumed with fire.

( f) The sumptuons Tomb that Queen Artemis^a built for her husband MANSOLVS
King of Caria, and reckoned one of the seven wonders of the world, was called
Mansoleum, after his name. Whereupon, at such costly and stately monuments are
so named; and more particularly, that of AUGUSTUS. Of which you may read more.
5. Gergrasti Strebonis, for the better explanation of this place.

( a) DEPOSITVM apud se.] Some read, apud 101
se, se^ v^gines vestiles, as if fix of these Vestail virgins had the custody
thereof, or at least wise brought the same forth, being committed to them all,
and the seventh, named Maxima, the Pr^oresse as it were, and governesse of the
rest, were left behind.

( b) This has a reference unto the As, or pound weight Roman consists of
12. ounces. which stands for the base and rule of many other things: and
namely here for the entiere inheritance that AUGUSTUS disposed of by his last
will and Testament. For, two third parts of 12. he gave unto TIBERIUS: and
another third part unto LIVIA, which made up the whole.

( c) That against the law (...), which expressly provided, That no man should
endow a woman in more the^ the fourth part of his goods. So that if a man died
seized of one hundred thousand pounds, his wife might not enjoy the thirds, but
only 25000 pounds and no more. Howbeit AUGUSTUS had a special Indulgence and
dispensation for this Law.

( d) Albeit TIBERIUS had been long before adopted his son, and thereby may
be thought to have assumed the names of his civil father, into his style: yet
this surname only of AUGUSTUS, would not he communicate with him, but left it
as here ditarie after his decease; as apeareth in Tiberius. As for Livia, after
Augustus his death she was commonly called Iulia Augusta: how ever some writers
retain her old name Livia, and others again in Augustus his life name her
Iulta: by the figure Prolepsis because she carried that name after he was dead.

( e) In most copies of SVETONIVS you find this reading, Legavit populo Romano
quadringentis, tribubustricies quinquies. In which words there may be thought a
Tautologie. For that the people of Rome and the Tribes (which were in number
135) be all one. Therefore, some learned men have thought good to leave out the
later clause wholly, or at leastwise, the word Tribulus. Others again would
have here two legacies to be implied, the one of four millens given generally
in common to the whole body and people of Rome, the other of three millenes
and one half, to be distributed among the Tribes in particular, or to the
poorest persons in every Tribe according to the discretion of their
Vicin^agistri. And these, put a distinction between populus and plebs, which
plebs is here understood under the name of Tribulus. But I leave it
indifferent, although I am not ignorant, that sometimes Populus and tribus be
confounded and put the one for the other, as also that tribus stand of the
vulgar and meaner sort of the people only, expressly distinct from populus,
Equites and Senatores, which the Poet terms Sine nomine turbam: and T. LIVIVS
not unaptly, Ignota captia. ^

( f) Which amounts by the computaion of BVDAEVS to three thousand and five
hundred Myrigdes.

ANNOTATIONS UPON Tiberius Nero Caesar:
IT seems that in 1
his own Native country, where the Inhabitants, before time were descended
from the Greeks, he had to name Atta Clausus: and being once incorporate among
the Romans, changed it, into APPIVS CLAUDIUS. Now, Atta ^auoreth of the Greek
word (...), which is in going, not to set the sole of the foot firmly upon
the ground, but rather lightly to tread as it were, on uptoe. Hereupon, as
FESTVS no^eth, they that have that imperfection in their fe^re, whereby they
can go no better, be called Attae. Which was the occasion, that one of the said
house took that name first, and so his poster^ie after him. Like as among the
Romans, of another accident, arose the name Agryppa first. For that one was
borne into the world with his feere forward. And these additions, whether they
were forenames or surnames in the beginning, it ski^leth not For surnames in
continuance of time came to be forenames, and contrariwise.

( b) If you have recourse unto the Original, NERO is as much as (...), or
(...) i. Nervatus or Nervosus: that is to say, well compact of nerves and
sinews: and such are strong.

( a) SENECA reports in his book Debrevitate 2
(...), cap. 12. That this CLAUDIUS persuaded the Romans first, to go to ^ea,
and embarke: Whereupon he was styled Caudex, which in our Latin is as much to
say, as the framing, and joining together of many plants or ribs of timber,
which is the very Periphrases of a Ba^ke.

( b) One if his predecessors who had a Jurisdiction there, gave it that name,
as having built likewise a Forum or Hall of Justice there. whereupon the
In^tonts of it and the territour thereabout, owing service to that court, as
Clients and dependants to that (...) a^forded this CLADIVS a meet place for
him of Innovation and usurping unlawful dom^ion.

( c) Observing Ignes from Birds, by their feeding, flying or otherwise, that
might give him warrant to go forward with the favor of the Gods, in his
Enterprise.

( d) Adoptions by order of Law, should follow the course of Nature, whereby
the son, cannot be elder than the Father. The cause why he sought thus
extraordinar^ to be adopted a commoner, ^as that he might be chosen Tribune of
the law.

( e) The usual manner in Rome was, that those persons who were arrested for
criminal causes, during all the time of their trouble and trial, should
change their apparel, and instead of gowns which were fair and white, put
on others sullied and foul, thereby to moove mertie and compassion of the
people. Whereupon such, Rei were called Sordidati.

( f) These Tribunes of the commons as may appear in T. LIVIVS were
sacrosancti. i. Vnviolable, and such as no violent hands might be laid upon.

( a) So called, of Salinae, the salt pits or salt houses. 3
For being Censor ^e set an impost upon salt, and thereby augmented the
revenewes of the State, little to the benefit or contemment of the people.

( a) FOR the manner was, that Governors of 4
provinces, who (as they were) so would be counted also, more courteous than
others, should unrequested allow some of their lectors unto all Roman Senators
that repaired unto them, for to do them honor: Ci^. ep. ad carnificium.

( a) IN token of his nativitie there which as they gave out, was borne to the
good vrbis and orbis. i. Of 5
Rome and the whole world besides, for so, by way of flattery they magnified
their Princes.

( a) Some read, Luctuosam. i. sorrowful, in regard of many hurts and dangers.
6


( b) When a chariot is drawn by a teeme of four steeds all in one rank or
affront, as we may see them pourtraited upon diverse coins, it must needs be
that the two middle a^e joined or yoaked as it were to the spi^e pole running
between them: and these be called (...). The other two then are without, the
one on the left, and the other on the right side, called (...) in Greek, and
in this place by our Author Funales, because they are guided and ruled by a
cord or some reins or cheine in lieu thereof. And say, that these quadrigij or
four steeds draw two by two in files, one pay re before the other: those
which be next unto the ^hariot be aptly called I^ales, and those before them
beyond the spire, Funa^es, of which, TIBERIUS rode upon one and MARCELLVS upon
the other.

( a) ACCORDING to the vulgar speech, (...) 10
samiliarit as paerit contemptum.

( a) THESE days were called Tali, because at 14
first they used with such cockall bones named Tali to play: but afterward
they were made of Ivory, gold, etc. Among many sorts of sorceries and
divinations, one there was by these bones or dies, and the wisards that
professed their cunning in it, were termed (...).

( b) For the greater light to this place, and better proof of Thrasillus
skill, Di^n reports, that when TA^RIVS intended verily to throw him down
headlong, he perceived him by his counterance to be much troubled and
disquieted in mind, whereupon he demanded the cause thereof, and then
Thrasyllus answered, that by speculation of the Stars he foresaw some present
danger to himself, and so Tiberius durst not proceed to execute this intent
of his.

( a) SEPTA, was a place in Mars Field railed about at first like a sheep Pen:
whereupon it was called 17
Ovilia. But afterward mounted with Marble stone, beautified also with stately
galleries and walks, within which cloysture and precinct, the people oftentimes
assembled about Election of Magistrates and other public affairs: yea and
with wares which were there set out to be sold. As Alex ab Alexandro witnesses.

( a) Some read Bructers, of which name there is 19
a nation, as well as of the Rhutaine in Gaul. Others, Rutero, as if he meant
one of those horsemen or riders in Germany, which at this day be called
R^tters. 20


( a) A long robe embrodred and garden with purple, a cassocke branched with
Date tres work, a rich mantell of sundry colors. A chaplet of Laurel, a
staff and chair, both of Ivorie, Live. lib. 30.

( a) BY this aenigmaticall speech, AUGUSTUS compares the State of the people
of Rome, unto the 21
miserable case of one, whom some savage and cruel beast has gotten between
his teeth, not devouring and dispatching him at once, but there holds and
cheweth him along while in exceeding pain: alluding to the secret malice, and
dreaming nature withal of TIBERIUS.

( b) It should seem that in adopting him, he used these very words, Hoc
Reipub* causa faci^. i. This do ^ for the commonwealths sake.

( c) Alluding to this verse of E^ius in the commendation of Qu. Fabius Max,

Vnus homo nobis c^ctando restituit rem.

One man alone by sage delay
Restored our state fallen to decay.
( d) In the tenth book of his Iliads, where Diomedes in making choice of
Ulysses, to exploit a pecce of service with him, gives him this praise.

( a) The Tribunes of the commons had power to call a Senate, but not
whenever they would, 23
without a special Decree granted by the Nobles.

( a) THE cohort or band of Soldiers which were of the Princes Guard, were
called Praetoriani, taking 25
that name of Praetorium which signifies the Lord Generals Pavilion in the
camp, his Royal Palace in Rome and else where. As also the Lord Deputies
house of. Estate in any Province. Now those Soldiers that gave attendance and
served in this place about the Prince or Governor, were entertained in better
condition than the rest, because their wages was greater, and the time of their
service shorter. For AUGUSTUS had set down their term twelve years, whereas
the rest, before they could be discharged, were to serve sixteen:

( b) It may be thought, that Germaniciani as well by the Grammatical Analogy
of the letter, as also by some circumstance of this very place, import a
refere^ce unto Germanicus the son of Drusus disceased. Like as Vitellini,
Flaviani. etc. But the learned observe, that as an Army lying encamped or in
Garrison, in Germany, is properly in Latin called Germanicus, so the Soldiers
of the said Army be fitly named Germaniciani.

( a) These solemnities were exhibited about the 26
midst of November, whereas the other, named Romans, were held in the beginning
of September.

( b) It is to be noted, that the name of Imperator in the Roman History is
taken three ways: First, for him, who by commission or warrant from the State,
has the conducting of an Army, And in this sense, it has relation to
Soldiers. And is all one, with Lord General of the field, or a commander,
etc. and the same that Praetor was in old time. Secondly, for a Victor or
Conqueror, namely when such a General or chiefetaine has bv natural precesse
achieved many valiant exploits, and put to sword such a number of enemies, as
the law sets down. For then the soldiers were wont to salute him by the
name of Imperator^i. Conqueror. Lastly for a So veraigne Prince, King and
Monarch. In the first acception, it is a mere Relative In the second a
surname, In the third and last, the forename of all the Roman Emperors, to
wit, from JULIUS, CAESAR forward Who although they wore not the Crown and
Diadem, were nevertheless, absolute Princes, Sovereigns, Kings and
Monarchs. The want of this distinction may breed some troubl^ in the readers
of the Romant History.

( c) Made of Oak branches, or in default thereof, of some other tree bearing
mast: which garland by the first institution, was given to that soldier, who
in battle had rescued a Citizen of Rome and saved his life. And afterward,
it, together with the Laurel, beautified the gates of the CAESAR'S Palaces,
although some of them were bloody Tyrants, and made no spare of their citizens
and subjects lives.

( a) THE manner was, if Prince or Senator were carried in his Litter, usually
supported by eight bond-servants, and thereupon called Octophor^n, to have a
company of Citizens in their gowns going before, and accompanying him by his
side, as also certain servitours to carry his curule chairc o^ ivory behind.

( a) THIS free embassage, called Libera legatio, 30
was granted many times to such, as being desirous either to travel and see
fortaine countries, or to fly, for avoiding of dangerous troubles at home:
thereby to be better entertained abroad, and with the more honest color, to
conceal the occasion of their departure, and absence as if they were sent from
the state, about the affairs only of Commonweal.

( a) IT was not ordinary with the Emperors to accompany the corpse unto the
fu 31
nerall Fire: but only to vouchsafe their presence at the Funeral Oration in
the Forum or common place. This therefore may be attributed unto TIBERIUS his
civil humanity.

( b) It appears by Dion, that they had omitted to subscribe the clause which
went in this form, Vota facimus pro te, Imperator i. We make our vows (and
pray) for thee O Emperor.

( a) CAUSES were heard judicially, and Justice 32
ministered, either from a superior place as the Tribunal or beneath upon the
even and plain ground, de plano, as the Lawyers speak, so that there were a
Chair or seat for the judge to fit upon. And the said place of Justice
wheresoever, either pro tribunali, or de plano posita sella, is properly called
Ius: as Carolus Sigonus has observed. lib. 1. cap. 7. de Iudiciis. Whereupon
comes the usual phrase, In ius vocar^. It seems therefore, that Tiberius
would come into the Comitium or Hall of Justice, and take his place, sometime
within the Tribunal (for it was a spacious rowme) or else fit in his Curule
chair of Ivory beneath, as a moderator, which is expressed here by the term
de plano.

( a) As Marchpanes, Tarts, Gingerbreed, Custards, 34
Sugared Biscuit, and generally all manner of pastrie-conceits, wrought with
honey or sugar. The work man is called Dulciarius, and the things, Ballaria
Mellita, or Pemmata. Toves not only needless, but hurtful also to the body,
according to that in Aulus Gellius, lib. 13. cap 11. Noct-Attic. ex var^.
Bellaria ea maxim sunt millita quae mallita (...) sunt: (...) societas inside.
i. such iunkers sort Or digestion.
not well with * Concoction. 35


( a) Diverse Statutes there were sharply punishing the adultery of Matrones
or married wives. An Actt likewise passed in the Senate, that no Person of
Knights degree or above, should play upon the stage, perform sword fight, or
combat with wild beasts for hire - Providing all to preserve the honor of
wedlock entire, and to maintain the reputation of Knighthood and Nobility.
Those shameless dames therefore, of whom Suetonius writes in this place,
either because they would be thought unworthy to be reckoned within the
censure of Law, or as TACITUS writes, deemed to have abidden punishment enough
in making profession of so base a trade and life. These lewd persons likewise,
and unreblameable unthrifts suffering themselves thus to appear noted with
infamy, and that upon record, made account, both the one and the other not to
be obnoxious or liable unto the statutes and acts aforesaid

( b) The manner was at Rome, for Tenaunts to remoove and flit out of one house
into another, upon the first day of July, like as with us, at the feasts of
Saint Michaell and the Anunciation of the Virgin Marie: which are the ordinary
rent days.

( a) JOSEPHUS. lib. 18. Antiquit. Iudaic. writes 36
that Tiberius sent ^000. of them into Sardinia, an Island in Summer time
especially, very intemperate and unwholesome, as may appear by that pretty
Epigram of Martialis, wherein he opposes the healthie City Tibur, to the
pestilent Isle Sardinia.

Nullo fata loco possi^ excludere, cum ^ors
Venerit, in Medio tibure Sardinia est.
No place exempt from fatal death, for when our time is come,
Mid- Tibut, will Sardina be found of all and some.
( a) THIS (...), who gave occasion of this Byword, was a famous Stage Player,
or one of these 38
Mimi, counterfaiting other men's gestures, as Beraaldus supposes. See Plutarch
in Apophtheg La^onic,

( a) BIBERIVS, a bibendo i. of drinking. Calius, a Calda, or Cali^a. i. hot.
Mero of Merum. 39
1. strong wine. An elegant Agnonuniation: whereby is showed, that he loved to
drink wine ho^e, which is right delicate, and goes down more merrily

( b) The Italicke Amphor conteyneth 48. (...), every Sextarius 20 ounces
Mensur^les, which is a wine pint and half of our measure with the better. By
which reckoning he duke at one meal a rundlet of ten wine gallons well near.

( c) A Bird that feeds upon grapes and figs especially, whereupon it took
the name. In Autumn or the latter end of Summer it is so called: at other
times Melanocoryphus, or Atricapilla, of the black cop, or hair-like feathers
that it carries upon the head.

( d) Of this Bird for the dainty flesh of it Martial made this Epigram,

Inter aves, turdus, si quis (...) judic^ certet,
Inter quadrupedes, groria prima Lep^.
Of fethered fowls, if I may judge, the blackbirde is the best,
Among four-footed beasts the Hair surpasses all the rest.
( e) To invet and devise new pleasures.

( a) ALLVDING partly to the Isle Caprea, and in part either to Capra in Latin,
a goat, or to (...) in 43
Greek, a wild bore, and that member, Quo viri sumus.

( a) Seneca reports thus, lib. 2. de oenefic. cap. 27. 49
Quater millies sesterti^ suum vidit. i. He saw of his own, 400 millions of
Sesterces.

( b) Provided it was by an ancient law, and the same revived by IVL. CAESAR
DICTATOR, that no person should in silver or gold possess above 60 sestertia,
that is, Three score thousand sestertis. This also may have a relation to that
order set down by him a little before, That named men and usurers should lay
out two third parts of their stock in lands and houses, etc.

( a) As we say, to make him Justice of Quorum, etc. For the decuries of Judges
were they Quorum nomina, 51
were written in the Commission Roll.

( a) The Greek verse is red thus, (...) 53
(...), or (...). etc.

( b) Scaliae Gemoniae. A place at Rome upon the Aventine hill, into which the
dead bodies of malefactors were dragged and thrown with shame.

( a) THEY speak the Greek language generally throughout all Greece, yet not
after one manner. For in diverse parts were different kinds of Greek 56
called Dialects, to wit, Attick, Ionick, Acolick, etc. Like as with us in
Great Britain a common English tongue goes well near throughout the whole
Island, albeit there is a diversity perceived between the Scot tish or Northren
English, and the Southern, between the Cornish and the Ken^sh, etc.

( a) In so doing the body must needs be bared and 58
some shame discovered which being an Impiety before the sacred Images of the
Gods, was made Treason also before the Emperors Statue, unto whom divine
honors were exhibited.

( a) The last Hexastichon or 6 verses, seems to make one entier Epigram by
it self. Every Disticl^ 59
before, carries a several sense. And as for the first two, they seem to have
a reference to the time, whiles he abode in Rhodes, before he was Sui Iuris.

( a) At which times, both among the Greeks and Romans also, the manner was to
forbear Execution yea and to ease prisoners of their yrons. 61


( b) As if under his person he had offered abuse unto the Emperor Tiberius.

( c) He would say, The courage and generositys of the Romans died with them,
seeing that none arose to recover their liberty oppressed and trod under foot
by this Tyta^t T^berius.

( d) Rather, two hundred and twenty. For Tau^us lib. 6. Anual. reports,
that all the suspected accomplices of Seianus were killed, Iac^it immensa
strage^, (...) sexus, omnis (...), etc.

( e) The like hypocritical Religion was practiced during the bloody
prescription in the Triumvirate. A young Gentleman nobly borne, because he
might not be killed lawfully, praetextatis i. under age, and wearing still his
embrodered garment praetexta, he commanded to put on his virile gown, and so
he was murdered. Appian. Di^.

( a) FOR wonderfully addicted he was to the study 67
of Astrology, and such curious Arts.

( a) THE full stature of men in Italy, was six foot 68
wanting two inches, if men grew higher than six they were accounted exceeding
tall, if to seven, (and to that height men may grow, as Varro, Gellius and
Solinus do write) they went for Giants. So that in Musters young men were
chosen soldiers, five foot high and ten inches, which was called Iusta
statura.

( b) Some read subiti, and not subtiles, to signify that such pimples
continued not, but arose and felt at times, much like to those that the
Physicians call Hidroa, Sudamina, or papulus sudorum according to PLINY,
proceeding of heat or swear, if the humors be sharp.

( c) Such be termed in Greek (...). And if we may believe the Physiognomie
delivered by ARISTOTLE: they be by nature deceitful and wily, given to
circumvent, entrap and supplant others.

( d) CORNELIUS CELSVS, among other good rules and precepts of Health, writes
thus, (...) (...) qui and been valet and suae spontis est, nullis obligare se
legibus debet, ac ne ^dico neque alipta ^gere, etc. But give he what directions
he will, and let us say what we can to this point, that men and women may be
Physicians to themselves, such is there misgovernment in diet and otherwise,
that Physicians shall never want employment. And as touching thirty years, of
age TACITUS adds moreover and says, That Tiberius.
he was wont to mock those and hold them to be fools, who after the said
years had need of other men's instructions, to know what was good or hurtful
for their bodies. Whereupon might arise our English proverb, A fool or a
physiti^.

( a) SVCH as were sung to the Harp. In which 70
kind Pindarus excelled among the Greeks, and Horace among the Romans.

( b) One of AVOVSIVS [adopted] sons. Yet some read JULIUS CAESAR.

( a) A word usual with us in these days, for who 71
knows not that Monopoly is, when one man engrosseth some commodity into his
own hands, that none may sell the same but himself, or from him?

( b) It signifies in this place a piece of workmanship set upon a cup or
other vessel of Gold or Silver to garnish the same, so fitted, as it may be
put to, or taken away at our pleasure. The ancient Poets in Latin called such
devises Insertas.

( c) Contrary to AUGUSTUS CAESAR, whose manner was ever and anon in his
speeches and writings to interlace Greek words and sentences.

( a) A place near the river Tiberis, so called of a 27
Navell fight exhibited sometime there, by Julius Caesar Dictator, within a
spacious pit receiving water for that purpose.

( b) In the port high ways from Rome, the manner of the Romans, was at every
miles end to pitch down a great stone, and according thereto were the miles
reckoned, like as with us in some places there stand crosses of wood or stone
to that end.

( c) i. A creeping Dragon. Which implies, that there be others winged, or at
least wise supposed to fly, in the common opinion of men. For the attribute,
Serpens, signifies Creeping. Now, because all of them use most so to do, the
general name of Dragons, goes under Serpents. And as for the word Dragon, it
is given to the whole kind of their quick sight, coming of Draco, in Latin,
and (...) in Greek, (...) i. of seeing.

( d) Recidiva peior radice, say the Physicians. The relapse unto a former
disease is more dangerous, than it was before.

( e) It took the name of L. LVCVLLVS, the Lord thereof.

( a) A town in Campania where he took so great 75
delight, and a place infamous for the licentious life of the inhabitants,
whereupon grew the name of those lascivious and filthy Comedies, Atellan^.
Aplague I say smiting well to her beastly behavior. As if he had been
unworthy to be conveyed to Rome, the City which so long before he had
abandoned.

( b) As poor beggar bodies were wont to be served in have, by the common
bearers, and not fully burnt with leisure.

( c) Where malefactors ordinarily were burnt.

ANNOTATIONS UPON Caius Caesar Caligula.
( a) CALLED by some, Annals 1
or A^nariae: of others, Comitiales. By which provided it was, In what years
of a man's age, he was capable of Questure, Preture, Consulate, or any other
like Office of State: as also, it was limited, within what time between, one
might eftsoons bear the same Office again. Item, what the term of every
Magistracy should be? etc. And albeit the ancient Romans had no such laws,
but (as CORNELIUS SCIPIO at his petition of Aedileship made answer, when
exception was taken against him for his young age) whomsoever the Quirites
would charge to be a Magistrate, he had years enough on his back, yet
afterward, sundry Statutes were enacted in that behalf: although by virtue
of special privileges, the same were not duly observed. By the Chronology it
appears, that he was but ninteene years old when he became Questor, like as
TIBERIUS before him.

( b) Which TIBERIUS envying his greatness, wrought, thereby to expose him unto
greater dangers.

( a) WELL might this unseasonable exercise puff 3
up and fill his skin with crudities and foggie humors, but hurtful unto his
health it was, and brought upon him diseases, and namely, that, called
Cardiac^, of which, some say, he died. Let them look to it therefore, who,
because they would be fat, not only fall to bodily exercise out of time, even
upon full stomachs, but also every morning eat in their beds and sleep upon
it, yea and ordinarily take a nap at noone, so soon as their meat is out of
their mouths.

( a) By this Attribute, Civil, in our Author, ye must understand, Courtesy,
Affability, and a part not exceeding that of private Citizens, without taking
any state.

( a) As if the Gods, whose Images were shrined 5
within, were not to be honored any longer as Gods, suffering so good a man as
Germanicus was, to die. For, as in token of honor, the people used to adorn
the Statues and Images of famous persons with flowers and green leaves, so,
whom they did vilipend and despise, they were wont to cast stones at their
Images and Statues.

( b) The Tut^larie Gods of the house which ordinarily stood within a closet,
called thereupon Lararium.

( c) For, to what end should they rear children any more? since Germanicus,
grown to so good proof, sped no better, but was taken away by untimely death.

( d) In this place, the circumstance shows, that the King of Parthians is
meant, how ever the Persian King and such mighty Mo^ches, having under their
Dominion other petty Kings as Tributaries or Homagers, be so called: like as
AGAMEMNON also in (...).

( a) Which, at Rome betokened a general mourning, occasioned upon some
extraordinary calamity, or fear of public danger, even as with us, the
shutting in of Shop-windowes, etc.

( a) ABOUT the mids of this month, began the ^
feast Saturnalia, celebrated with good cheer, with revels, dances, gaming and
all kind of liber^e.

( a) For, common soldiers wore a certain studded shoe, named Caliga. 9


( a) WHICH was later than the ordinary time, by reason of Tiberius his
lingering. For, usually these 10
complements were performed at 17 years of age.

( a) IN this habit and manner of attire, counterfeiting a woman, thereby to
decline suspicion when he entered into other men's houses for to dishonor 11
them and abuse their wives, whom our author terms here Adulteria, pro
adulteris, as else where, conjugi^, pro conjugibus.

( b) The fabulous History of Phaeth^ is well known, namely, how by
misgovernment of the steeds which drew the Chariot of the Sun his Father, he
set the whole world on fire: By Ph^thon therefore is meant, a combustion (as it
were) and general confusion of the Provinces, like as by the watersnake, the
very bane and poison of the Roman State.

( ^) To do him the greater honor, they intertaine him upon the way (as the
manner was), with Sacrifices, Torches, Tapers, and wax lights. 13


( a) An opinion there was deeply settled in men's heads, that the death of one
man might be excused and redeemed, with the death of another. 16


( a) The two hundred penie.

( b) His half image downward from the head to the wast, portrayed with a
Shield or Scutchion: and the same was commonly set out with the largest.
Hereupon, M. TVLLIVS CICERO, when he saw such a demie personage representing
his brother QVINTVS in the province that he governed (and a very little man he
was of stature) My brother, quoth he, in his half part, is greater than in the
whole.

( b) A festival holiday solemnized by heardmen, in the honor of Pales their
Goddesses and Patroness. Upon which day, the foundation of Rome City was
laid. This feast they kept, the 12. day before the Kalends of May, to wit, the
20 of April.

( a) Menius, a riotous unthrift, when he had wasted ^8
his Patrimony and sold his Capital house in Rome, excepted in the sale, and
reserved to himself and his heirs, one Column or Pillar, from which he
projected and put forth into the street a jettie, and upon i^ built a gallerie:
out of which he might behold the sword-sencers in the market place, whereunto
he had a fa^e prospect from the said Pillar. Whereupon all such galleries or
buildings jetting out in the street, be called Ma^a. 22


( a) THE end of one verse, and beginning of another, cited out or Her in the
second of his Ilias. The Poet ascribes them unto sage ^lysses, in this sease.

One [Sovera^gne] Lord,
One King let there be.
( b) By exchaunging the ensigns and Ornaments of the Roman Sovereign or
Emperor, with the Regal Diadem, purple Robe and S^epter.

( c) Phoenico^us is a water foul haunting lakes and fenaes, and the river
Nilus, as H^siodus writes. The feathers be of color read, or purple. Whereof
it takes the name: and the tongue is a most dainty and pleasant mo^sell. So
said Apitius, (...) (...) altis^ gurges. Of this Bird Martial made an Epigram.

D^ ^ihi pe^a ru^ens ^omen: sed li^gua gulosu
N^stra sapit. Quid si g^ula lingua fores.
My name I take of wings so red, but unto gluttons ta^t,
My tongue right pleasing is: oh, what, if it could prate as fast.
( d) Some take them for Bistards: Birds decked, no doubt, with most beautiful
feathers: as may appear by Tertullian against Marcion, in these words: V^a
Tetraon^s pennula, ( taceo de pa^o) sordid^m artificem pronuntiabit tibi
Creatorem?

( e) They are thought to be Hens of Guinny.

( f) By the description of Clit^, they be our Turkies.

( g) The Phesant called in old time Itis, (which was the son of Terens and
Progne, transformed, as Poets feign, into this Bird) and afterward Phasia^ or
Phasiana [ A^is], took his nams of Phasis a river and City in Colch^s,
according to this Epigram of Martials,

Argiva (...) sum transp^rtata Carina:
A^te mihi not^ ^il ^isi Ph^sis erat.
In Argive ship transported first, I was to foreign land:
Fore-time, naught else but Phasis town, I knew, or Phasis strand.
( a) PHILO reports this far otherwise, and 23
tells a pitiful Narration: How, by commission from Cai^, certain Colonels
and Centurians came to young TIBERIUS, commanding him to kill himself:
because, forsooth, unlawful it was for any other to murder a Prince of the
Imperial blood. The youth, who had never seen any man killed, and by reason
of his tender years was nothing at all experienced in the world, requested
first of them, who were come thus to him, for to strike off his head, which he
held out unto them: but seeing his request would not be heard, he desired them
yet, to instruct him, in what part of his body he should stab himself for the
speediest death? And so by instructions from them he was his own executioner.

( a) ROMULUS ^avished the Sabine virgins: 25
and AUGUSTUS, by force took from TIBERIUS his wife LIVIA.

( a) Selena, in Greek, signifies the Moon. And 26
well known it is, that as M. AN^ONIVS the Tri^vir called himself BACCHVS and
OSI^IS, so, CLEOPATRA his wife, took pleasure to be named Luna. i. the Moon,
and Isis. Whereupon they gave to their son ALEXANDER be gotten between them,
the name of the sun, and to their daughter CLEOPATRA the name of the Moon,
or Selena, which is all one.

The Consuls were reputed still (in outward show) Sovereign Magistrates,
although indeed, that Caesar's carried all before them, and were absolute
Monarchs.

( c) Some read, Tesseras deci^a citius. i. Before the tenth hour, or four of
the clock after noone, for so long continued the Stage-plaies ordinarily. At
which time, the Emperors were wont to bestow their Tickets or Talies among the
people, by virtue whereof they received such and such gifts.

( d) There be learned Critics that expound this place far otherwise,
reading Pegmares, in steed of Pegmatis, and understanding thereby such
swordfencers, whose good hap it had been to escape with life, the fall from
those Frames or Pageants called Pegmata or Pegm^, which with certain vices or
Skrewes were set up, and let down, Upon which as on scaffolds, malefactors
were brought forth, either to exhibit a show unto the people, fighting one with
another at sharp, to the outrance, or to make them sport, by falling down
into a pit underneath, where either wild beasts were ready to devour, or fire
to consume them. A devise wrought by dissolving the joints of the said Pegmes
under them. And in this sense they interpret the rest that follows,
concerning Patresfamilias, i. good honest Citizens householders.

( a) HE had espied in the multitude of those prisoners 27
and malefactors, two with bald heads, distant far a sunder, and happily, as
much as from the one end of the place unto the other: all those between,
without respect of their cause, he commanded to be put to death indifferently.

( b) An ordinary thing it was at Rome, to swear by the Genius, as also by
the Fortune, the health etc. of their Emperors. And what a devout oath this
was, per Geniuns. i. the Dam^n, the spirit, or superintendent Angel of the
Prince, which I take to be as much, as by his own good self, appears by
Tertullian Apologet. cap. 28. Citius apud vos per omnes deos, quam per Geniuns
principis peieratur.

( c) Seneca lib. 2. de Ira. cap. 33. reports the like example of Castor a
right worshipful Gentleman of Rome, whose son, the same CALIGVLA, upon very
envy that the young man was a proper and beautiful person, put to death in
his fathers sight, and then invited the old man to supper, provoked him to
carouse and be merry, which the good father was feign to endure and make
semblance of contentment, for fear, least the Tyrant would have done as much
by another son, whom he had living.

( d) Catenis verberatum. Among other chasticements of the body, there is
reckoned Vinculorum v^rberatio, as Callistratus witnesses, lib. 7: de poe^is.
The ignorance whereof, has made some to read, in Catenis verberatnm. 1. bound
in chains and then beaten, others, habenis, for catenis: as if he had been
well lindged with lether thongs or halters ends, as slaves were wont to be
served by the (...).

( a) ALBEIT, the proper use of these Graphia 28
was to cut or engrave letters only, in tables of bark or soft wood: yet,
because it was unlawful to wear weapons in the Senate house, some, of a
mischievous mind, made those writing styles or Steeles so, as they might kill
therewith, Enacted therefore it was, that no man should carry about him such
writing instruments of iron or steel, but of bone only. And yet even these,
as others also of reeds and quils, were made so keen and sharp, that they
were able to give a mortal wound.

( a) For the manner of the Roman Emperors was, upon displeasure, to send men
and women away 29
into some desert Isles, and there to confine them.

( b) Ellebor, that grows in the Isles Anty cire, is of most effectual
operation. The root is that, whereof is made our sneesing powder. It purges
extreemely by vomit. Thereupon arises the Proverb, Naviget Anticyram 1. Let
him sail to Anticyra, applied to one that is melancholicke in the highest
degree, and little better than mad. See Pliny. Natural. Hist. lib. 35. cap. 5.

( a) Some conjecture very well, that this Tetrinius 38
was not surnamed LATRO, being the addition appropriate to the noble Family of
Rome, of the Portii, but a notorious thief or robber, such as in Latin is
called Latro. And of that sort commonly were they that performed before the
people this bloody fight with unrebated swords, without foiles. And no
mervaile, if he termed all the Citizens there assembled Tetrinios. i. Thieves,
considering he wished before, that he could cut of al their heads at one blow

( a) He suspected, that she had given him some lovedrinks.

( a) PRAETER aq^um.] How this can stand 33
with his pride or malice, which our author has propounded to exemplify, I
cannot see. In some copies 34
we read, praeter cum. i. beside him, that is to say, otherwise than he would
have them, or approve. And one Critic or Judicious Lawier, ^anc. Hott^man, as
also Coracius, read, prater Eccum, as if he should say, All Lawyers shall give
none other answer but this. Behold him, meaning the Emperor CAIUS, thereby
referring the decision of all matters to his will and pleasure. Lastly,
Torrentius concludes the Period thus, Ne quid respondere possint. i. That they
should give no answer at all. And for praeter aequum, etc. he puts
praeterea* i. Moreover, for a beginning of the next chapter.

( a) COLOSSEROS, seems to be a word compounded ^5
of Colossos and Eros. The one imports his tallness, resembling the stately
and Giant like personages called Col^, and the other, his lovely visage,
representing Eros, even Love, or Cupid it self.

( b) These fencers, called Threces or Thraces, so think^ Sabelli* ^s.
thought to be the same that Retiarii, were lightly appointed for armor, and
put to desperate fight, as having all parts of their bodies exposed to danger,
whereupon they were called also Tunicati, and were matched in oppositio^ with
the Mir^illones, as this verse of Ansonius implie^h,

Quis mirmilloni * componitur? aequim^nus Thrax. Whereas the other named
Hophmachi, had for their (...), co^mittitur
defense, head pieces and targuets. Senec. lib. 1. Epist. 7.

( c) The priest, called Rex N^rensis, of ^ place where Diana Ari^ was
worshipped, within a temple beautified with a grove about it, by a barbarous
custom of the Scithians, so long only held his place, until after one years
revolution, some one stronger than himself, stepped unto him and overcame him
in single fight, and so deposed him, like as, by the first institution,
himself, foyling another in combat attained thereto.

( a) Seneca writes Consolat. ad Helv. That i^ was ordinary with him, to
consume at one supper ten 37
millions of sesterces, and who studied himself, and laid his head to others,
how he might at one supper make an even hand with the revenewes and tributes of
all the provinces belonging to the state of R^me.

( b) Some read for [ ^e Cedris] Deceres, after the form of Maneres, meaning
by Dec^res a mighty ^allie furnished with ten ranks of Oars, for such ^e
Greeks call (...).

( a) Dum inculta commissa fierent.] Which may be 41
expounded otherwise thus, when as many things were forfaited and confiscate.

( a) Taking the name from Exploratores, a military 45
term, signifying the Avant-couriers and foreriders, to discover the enemy,
and to clear the coasts.

( a) Yet Di^n reports of him, that otherwhiles, 51
when it thundered aloft, he would seem to do the like beneath with a thunder
barrel, or such a kind of devise: when it lightened, to make flashes with
fireworks: and if a thunderbolt fell, to discharge likewise some stone out of
an engine.

( a) Which ornaments belonged to Jupiter and Aesculapi^. 52


( b) Resembling thereby Neptune, for it Symbolizeth his po^ ^er waters in Sea
River. Lakes.

( c) The Ensign of Mercury, betokening his Eloquence.

( a) So called, because they were exhibited in the Palatium. 56
57


( a) Capitalium, although (...), it was the stately mount or Castle of Rome,
yet it became a general name of all Citadels and strong Castles built for the
defense of any City.

( b) Meaning the murder of Caius Julius Caesar Dictator.

( c) Bearing the name of a notorious thief, or Captain rather of thieves,
crucified for his deserts.

( a) BY virtue of this Act, himself, his lands 9
and goods were proscribed and exposed to open sale, in a Table hung up by an
Edict from the masters of the Exchequer or Citie-Chamber. And if within the
time appointed, he came not in, to satisfy the debt, nor any chapman or
surety to undertake it, he and his whole state, fell by escheate as forfait
and confiscate into the Princes hands.

( a) THESE Islands are situate in the mouth of 17
the River Rhosu^.
Rhodamus: and they be so called of the order in which they lie.

( a) THE name of this Fencer Palamous, signifies 21
also in the Latin tongue a Stock-dove* which gave occasion unto him, to come
out with this od jest.

( a) PROVIDED it was by the law Papia. That 23
^o woman under fifty years of age should be married to a man three-scor
years old or upward: Item, That no man under three score years, or upward
might wed a woman, fifty yers old or above. Where, note: That these words [ a
Tiberio] as if he added the said Branch, seem to have been foysted in:
considering that as it appears by TACITUS) the Emperor TIBERIUS went about
to moderate the foresaid law, and not to make it more strict by annexing such a
clause.

( a) For fear of breaking up the pavements, if they rode in coach, wagon,
chariot, or on horseback. 25


( b) In diverse Greek and Latin writers, the names of Jews and Christians
were confounded: so as by Jews they understood Christians.

( c) Orchestra was that place in the forefront of the Theater or Scaffolds,
and nearest unto the Stage, wherein the Senators ordinarily sat, and sometime
the Emperor himself.

( d) Popularia, were seats within the scaffolds and Theater, most remote from
the Stage, wherein the common people were allowed to stand or sit. Between the
said Orchestra and these Popularia were raunged the Knights or Gentlemen of
Rome, and those ranks bare the name of Equestria.

( e) So called, of the mountain Eryx in Sicilie, where she was highly
worshipped, and where she had a Temple.

( a) As for Drusilla his wife, a Jew borne, she had 28
been married indeed before to king Azyzus, as Josephus writes: but as
touching the other two Queens, whosoever they were, he was acquainted with them
otherwise, and not in way of marriage, so far as I can find.

( b) For every man might not so do, unless he had a Knights estate, which
was four hundred thousand Sextarij, or were free borne: Neither Libertines nor
Mechanical persons living by base trades and occupations were allowed.

( a) Other writers, as Philostratus and Iulianus, say 29
moreover, That without his wife and freed men, he was (...), and (...), much

stomach, which is called (...). The pain whereof, PLINY affirms to be most
intolerable, next unto the passion of the strangury.

( a) Flatum crepitumque ventris.] By Flatum, understand that riddance of wind
downward, qui ^ares ferit, non aures. Which in English comes near 32
unto the Latin word, Visio, for that the verb Visir^, is the same, (...). As
CICERO in his Epistles has well, but covertly observed, out of the word
D^visio, Wherein he notes Quiddam Cacemphaton. Which place some interpreters,
for ignorance of the said verb Visia, have expounded very absurdly.

( a) So sumptuous were these feasts, that Pontificum 33
Caena, and Saliares Epulae, grew into a proverb, to express exceeding great
belly cheer, and most delicate fare.

expresses thus, Nervisalienis mobile lignum.

( a) For with their Grapbia, as has been noted 35
before, they might do a mischief.

( a) Irae atque Iracundiae. Ira signifies the hot 38
and momentanie passion of anger, soon enflamed and as soon quenched, and
Iracundia seems to be taken here, for the continuance of the said anger, and
an inveterate settled wrath* Howsoever our Dictionaries would teach us the
contrary. The one may be called Gall or Choler, the other spleen or Melancholy.

i. That no fool counterfaits solly.

( a) It was an inconsiderate speech of an Emperor, 40

( b) These words without all time or ^eason were rife in his mouth, which
unadvisedly he had taken up, and by use could not leave them.

( a) For, by report of Dion and Xiphili^ his stature 43
far exceeded the proportion of his years.

that he caught his bane and died in the Palatium at Rome.

( a) These were, at it plainly appears, Questors, 46
Aediles, Tribunes, Praetors, Censors and Consuls. Of all these, some one or
other died, excepting Censors, as TACITUS writes. 12. Annal.

ANNOTATIONS UPON Nero Claudius Caesar.
( a) THESE four factions or 5
crewes that ran with Chariots for the prise, were distinguished by four
colors of cloth, or liveries, and thereupon called by these names Alba. i.
White, Veneta, watchet or light blew, Prasina. i. green, and Rosea. i. Rose
colored or read. Unto which were added by Domitian Aurata and Purpurea. i.
Gold colored or yellow, and purple. The former four Sidoni^ Apollinaris has
comprised in his Hendecasyllabes, thus,

-- -- micant colores,
Albus cum veneto, virens rubensque.
Then shine these crewes and make a gallant show

In white, in blew, in green and roset hew.

Proportionate they are unto the four seasons of the year: white, to the
Autumn or end of Summer, Watchet to the winter, Green to the spring, and Red
to summer, or as some would have it, to the four Elements.

( b) Physicians have observed three kinds of dropsy. The first is Ascites,
wherein the belly does swell with much water gathered between the inner skin
or rine of the belly, and the cawle which lappeth the guts, and some wind
withal, so named of (...) in Greek. i. A bottle, because in turning of the
body to a side, the water is perceived to shog in the womb, like as liquor in
a bottle half full, when it is shaken. The second, Tympanites, wherein the
belly is hoven up with wind especially, and some water among. Whereby it will
sound like a ta^er or drnm, if one tamper upon it, and thereof it was so
called. The third Leucop^legmatias, ana sarca, Hyposarca, In Latin Inter us, or
Aquae inter cutem, in the ^er Corne^ Celsus at ^ibuteth this (...) to all,
(...) kinds.
proper signification when the body all over is puffed up with water and wind
running between the fell and the flesh. And thereof as should seem, died this
Domitius.

( a) To wit, the ninth day after he was borne, on 6
which, they used to name their sons. And as this day was called Nominalia,
so there was a goddess forsooth, president of this complement and ceremonies,
whom they named Nundina.

( a) The manner was, during these solemnities in 7
the Albane month, (where the chief magistrates were present) to leave for
Provost of the City, some principal young Gentleman of the Nobility, before
whom sitting judicially, causes of no great importance should be brought.

( a) These youthful sports Iuvenalia, or Iuvenales ^udi, were first
instituted by this NERO, privately 11
in houses or gardens, and orchards. Wherein, of all degrees, ages and sexes
they daunced and revelled.

( a) The fabulous reports of Lady Pasiphae wife 12
to King Minos, how she was enamoured of a Bull, as also of Icarus the son of
Daedalus, who would needs attempt to fly in the air, be well enough known to
them that are but meanly seen in Poetry.

( b) Iuxca cubiculum eius decidit. By Cubicul^m, he means here, a toyall
seat raised on high wit^ in that quarter of the I heater called ^rchestra,
under a rich Tent or Canopie, where Emperors were wont to sit when they beheld
(such solemnities. These Pavillions were called in Greek (...) in some sort
resembling bed chambers.

Gymnasium.

^. allowances given unto them, either in money, or ca^es, in recompense of
their ordinary salutations and attendance.

( b) As there were sundry factions or crewes favourizing this or that color
of the Chariotters, so were there likewise of Actours and players. whereupon
many r^ots, outrages Fraies and others were committed.

( a) It should seem, that for the pleading and trial 17
of causes, such Trito^nell seats, pues, benches and bars, were erected at
first, for the present occasion, and taken down again by certain persons,
who gathered therefore a rent of those that went to law.

( a) Diverse Kings of P^tus were named Pole^ones 18
as of Egypt Ptole^ whereupon the realm Pontus, is by Vopiscus called

their cost and labor came to naught: (...)

slicke and glib with sweet oils, that they shone again.

( a) For, so would he have it to be called. And Thraseas 21
Patus was iudicially convented, and deeply charged, because he had never
offered sacrifice for that heavenly voice of his. Tacit.

( b) who was with child by her own brother Macareus, whereupon her father
A^olus caused the child newborn to be cast before hungry dogs: and sent a
sword to his daughter to kill her self with.

( c) In revenge of his father Agamemnons death, by her murdered, whereupon he
fell into a furious kind of deep melancholy.

( d) who unwitting killed his own father Laius, as ignorantly wedded his own
mother Iocasta.

( e) By putting on a garment next his skin, enuenomed with the poison of
Nessus the Centaure, and so sent unto him as a token, from his wife Deia^ira.

[ a] It may be thought, that he then acted Oedipus 24
or Creon. or some other King, and therefore carried in his hand a regal
staff or Scepter: Yet some interpret this of a Laurel rod or branch, such as
Actors held in their hands whiles they sung.

( b) For, at Olimpia, were Games also of Criers, striving who could cry
lowdest, for the prize.

( c) These were called Hiero^icae, as one would say, sacred victories, to wit
at the solemn games in Greece, Ne^a, Pythia, Ist^ia, and Olimpia.

( a) Five thousadd were there of these Gallants, 25
as Xiphilinus writes, ready to applaud him when he chaunted.

( a) He means either a peruke and cap of counterfeit 26
hair, (...), Dionis thereby disguising himself: the same that in Caligula he
terms Capillamentum, or else some hood covering his head all save the eyes.
Julius Capitolinus calls it Cucullionem, wherewith the Emperor Verus played
such parts by night, in imitation of Caligula and Nero.

( b) Quintana, was a Gate or Street rather in the Roman Camp, wherein was
usually kept, Forum rerum ^tenfilium, in resemblance whereof, he termed a
certain place in his house Quintana, in which he made sale of such wares and
commodities, as he had gotten together by (...) and robbing.

( c) It appears by Tacitus, that this was Julius Montanus, who, albeit he
had not sitten in counsel as Senator, yet was Laticlavius, and wore the
Senators Robe, Such Gentlemen were called Iuvenes secundi ordinis, in
distinction of those of the Imperial blood, or otherwise near allied unto the
Emperor.

(a) The manner was in old time to employ the 17
day in businesses, and therein to take no liberal meals, putting off the
full refection, and cherishing of the body until night. Convivia de die,
argued Intemperance, much more then, feasting from noone to midnight.

( b) Ambubaiarum. These took their name (as most expositors have
conjectured), Quod circa Ba^as versarentur. Yet some learned men of later time
fetch the same from this Syriacke word (...), as if such were Syrian women, who
being otherwise naughty packes and callots, gat their living also by playing
upon certain instruments of music, which they brought with them out of their
native country.

( c) Copas imitantium. Although Copae, properly be such women as keep
victualling houses, ready not only to entertain, but also to invite and call
in guestes, yet because these commonly are very bold and unshamefaced, this
term goes indifferently for strumpets and curtesans. For seldom shall a man
see an impudent woman that is not withal incontinent, so inseparably is
modesty joined with Chastity.

( d) The corrupt text in this place, has given occasion of much obscurity,
and ministered matter enough for Critics to work upon, while some read
Mellita, others Myrtitrichila. By which are meant certain sweat junkets, as
dainty wafers, etc.

( e) This may be thought incredible, That banqueting conceits at one sitting
should cost so much, and the aspersion of rose or other odo^ferous liquors
arise to more. Where is to be noted the observation of some, who for, ab Syrt^a
rosaria, read aspersio rosaria, that is to say, the artificial besprinkling
and aromatizing (as I may so say) of banqueting rowmes, out of sponts and
pipes, conveying odoriferous waters and oils, going under the name of Rosaria.
Which spouts, if they were made of silver or gold, (as we read they were at the
feast of others, when he gave Nero entertainment) might soon amount to that
sum. To say nothing of the costly compound distilled waters, or extracts and
oils, themselves, drawn out of most precious simples and spices.

( d) Him he called, as other Authors write, Sabina 28
and Poppaa, after the name of his wife deceased.

( a) In other writers he is named Pythagoras, so 92
that it should seem he carried two names.

( a) A great Magician, whom he entertained thus 30
royally, because he would have learned magic of him. See Pliny.

( b) Whereas AUGUSTUS when he played at this game, ventured no more, than for
every Talus, which were four in all, a single deaier. For it should seem
that the game of Tals here mentioned, was Pleistoboleuda. i. who could throw
most with four T^ali' whether the same were cockall bones in deed, or made of
gold, silver or Ivorie, with four sides, every one representing a chance, to
wit, an Ace or unity and sile, a trey and quatre, opposite, one unto the
other. For they wanted deux and cinque, which the Tessera Cubus, or Die carrying
six faces, has.

( c) It is evident hereby, as also out of that verse of (...).

Vtlati phaleris omnes and totquibus omnes.

That these Phalerae, were not Trappings, and furniture belonging to horses,
but some other ornaments, wherewith footmen and horsemen both were trimly
decked.

( a) IN this verb Morari, there is couched a double 33
sense, which gives the grace unto this pleasant scoff. For, being a mere
Latin word, and having the first syllable by nature short, it signifies, to
stay or to make long abode, and taking it thus, NERO might be thought to imply.
thus much, that CLAUDIUS was now departed out of the company of mortal men,
and raunged among the heavenly wights, but take the same word, as Nero spoke
it, derived of * (...) in Greek, which fignifyeth, A (...).
fool, and has the first syllable long it imports, that Cclaudius played
the fool no longer here in the world among men. Read the little pamphlet of
Se^eca entitled (...), if ye would see Claudius depainted in his colors, and
in a fools coat: which he, as it may appear, composed of purpose to gratify
Nero in that humor of his.

( b) The Greeks call this (...). And the Romans in honor of their Princes,
were wont to compass the same all about with a wall of flint, or other durable
stone, as marble.

( a) It may be it was in the same form, that Justinius 34
Martyr cites out of Orphens.

(...).
Fortes opponite profaniss
Which Virgil in some sort has expressed thus.

Procul este prafani.

And Claudian after him.

Gressus remorete profani.

( a) THE like example is reported by Vopiscus in Aurelianus, who took
wonderful delight in a mighty 37
* Eater, that in one day before his own table, (...).
devoured a wild (...)-full and whole, an hundred loaves of bread, a wether
(...), and a pig.

( a) This (...) verse as (...) writes, was rise also in Tiberius Coesars
month. 38


( b) Alben this word, Iusula, beside the common signification of an Island, it
taken for an house standing entire by it self, a part from other, yet in this
Author I observe that it is put else where for other houses also and tenements
let out to tenements by the owners and Landlord, who are called D^mini
Iusularum. And even in this acception, it may well go in this place.

( c) This toure Horace describes. car^. lib. 3. Od. 19. in these words.

M^lem propinquam nubibus arduis, etc.

( a) WHICH number arises to ten thousand a month. A mortality nothing
comparable to that 39
which as Eusebius reports, reigned at Rome in the days of Vespasian, in
which there died of the pestilence ten thousand a day, not to that in
Constantinople, when many days, there were likewise ten thousand dead bodies
called forth Procop. lib. 2. di bello persico.

( b) Such a rumor in deed ran rife, but untruly. Tacitus.

( c) Orestes to revenge his father Agamemnons death wrought by Clytemnestra
his mother and Acgysthus the adulterer, murdered her.

( d) Alcinaeon son of Amphiarius and Eriphyle, killed her, because she had
contrived his fathers death.

( e) Aeneas carried his old father Anchises upon his shoulders out of the fire
of Trey when it burned. Here is to be noted the duple sense of the verb [
Sustulit] in one and the same Latin verse: For in the former place, it
signifies to Kill, or make away, as Nero did his mother, in the later, to take
up and carry as Nero did his father. This yields and elega^t grace in Latin,
and cannot so well be expressed in english.

( f) Apollo, was surnamed (...) of (...) in Greek, which signifies to strike,
or of (...), to case and allay paint, as being a God, that both sends
diseases, and also cures them. But commonly the Romans term him so. in this
latter and better sense. He is styled likewise Hecatebeletes in Greek, which is
as much, as shooting or wounding from afarr. In these abstruse significations
and obscure terms therefore this Epigram implies thus much: That whiles now
in the habit of Appollo plaieth upon the harp, and would seem to be a mild
and gracious Prince: the parthian King with bow and arrows representing Apollo
likewise, endaungered the Empire of Rome. and all, through the supine
negligence of Nero geven to his Music and other vanities excessuely.

( g) This is meant by that huge house of (...) building, and has a reference
to that desolate estate of Rome, when it was sacked and fyred by the French,
after the imfortunate battle of Allia, what time the Romans were in
consultation to abandon the City and depart to Veij., there to inhabte.

( h) It seems that Nero in his Poem entitled Tr^ca, had used to chaunt of
Naupli^s the father of (...), who abid many calamities himself, and in revenge
of his sons death, wrought much mischief to others. The Cynicke therefore,
notes Nero for his singing, as also for abusing his own good parts in
perpetrating all wickedness, or else for mispending his treasure so
dissolutely.

(i) (...). Artemidor. lib. 1. cap. vlt.

( k) By Orcus, or Pluto, taken for the God of Hell or the Grave, is understood
death, in this place, ready to seize upon the Senators, whose overthrow Nero
had intended. Now, well known it is, that the manner was then, among the
Romans, as at this day with us, to carry forth their dead with the feet forward.

It should seem, this answer was delivered in these words.

(...).
Of sixtieth year (I do thee reed) 40

And thirteenth more, see thou take heed.
Whereby Apollo (for his oblique aunswers rightly of the Greeks termed Loxias)
or the Devil himself, whether you will, playing with him in a twofold and
ambiguous construction, (as his manner was) deluded him. For whiles he rested
secure, dreaming still of the 73 year, which he supposed was meant of his own
age, and which he was far short of, he fell into the hands of Galba, a man
indeed of those years.

Rome was wont to be served of corn from Alexand^ 45
in Egypt, in the time of dearth especially, when (...), otherwise reckoned
Horreum populi Roman^. ^. the people of Romes Garner, 'was not able to furnish
them. Now, when in steed of corn long expected, there arrived certain sail
from thence fraught with dust and sand for the sports of his gallants: no
mervaile if all the coffeehouse and heart burning of the people conceived
against Cornmongers and such as made gain by the scarcity of grain,
redounded upon NERO and his Courtiers.

( b) (...) The end of some Trimetre or Sen^rie Ia^icke verse in a Tragedy.

( c) (...) i. Now it is high time to drive or draw. In both which Empreses, by
a most tart and bitter Sarcasmus, is taxed his excessive love of Charioting.

( d) The speech of the people, or of his mother, who could not reclayme him.

( e) As a Pa^icide or Killer of Parents, etc. whose judgment was to be sowed
quick within a lether budge, etc.

( f) There is not only an (...) in the word [ Gallos] signifying the French
Nation, and the crowing cocks,, but an Amphibole also in the sentence: whereby
it may be understood, either that NERO with his chaunting, had awakened the
French, who began now to revolt, as not able any longer to endure his songs: or
that the French awakened him, to bestirre himself and look better about him:
as if they were the Cocks indeed, to raise him out of his drowsy security.

( g) The ambiguitie of this word [ Vindex], implies both a private chastiser
of servants for their faults, and also C. JULIUS Vindex or a revenger of
public injuries, and maintained of the common liberty. Who now had taken
Arms against Nero.

( a) AVSPICIA, albeit they properly do signify presaging tokens delivered by
birds: yet the sequence and circumstance of this passage, lead us rather to
some other uncouth prodigie^ and strange sightes.

( b) NERO was semblably distained, in another 46
kind: as having murdered his Father * CLAUDIUS, his mother Agrippina, and his
two wives Octaria Who adopted him.

( a) A caelatura carminu^ Homeri. Which if we 47
strain a little, may be englished thus, for the workmanship and engraving

Nectors, described by Homer in the eleventh of his Ilidas.

( b) An half verse out of Virgil. 12. Aeneid. The words of Turnus, unto his
sister Iutur^a.

( c) Although there were diverse Praefecturae in Egypt, called No^i, as one
would say, Shires or Divisions, as appears in Plini^, 5. lib. cap. 9. Yet by
this place is to be understood the Presidencie over all Egypt, which by the
institution of Augustus, was ordinarily conferred upon some Gentlemen of Rome.
By which, it appears, he would play at small game rather than sit out.

ANNOTATIONS UPON Marcus Salvius Otho.
( a)NOT without the Rampyer and precinct 1
of the Camp, where was the ordinary place of execution: not by the
ministry of a Centurion, who by order was deputed, to see Justice done: but
in the very face and most frequented quarter of the Camp called Principia,
not far from the Lord Generals Pavilion, and where the Principal Captains
quartered and lodged: Wherein also, the maine Standard named the Aegle and
other military ensigns of the bands and cohorts were kept: even in his own
fight being General, whose manner was not to be present.

( a) THIS rude and gross kind of sport was thereupon called Sagatio, not
unlike to that pastime 2
with us in some place called the canvasing, and else where, the vanning of
dogs.

( a) FOR, after that by commandment of NERO, he and POPPAEA, were in some
sort put 3

the religious ceremony, not bestowed them quietly again in their places.

( a) SOME read Sectionibus and Suturis: 2
expounding it thus, as if his son had been not a cobbler, but a shoemaker
indeed, occupied in cutting of new shoes and sowing them together.

( b) These kind people, so double diligent about the feminine sex, be fitly
called good womens-men: and doting overmuch upon their wives, Vxorii in Latin,
as one would say Bridegroomes still. Such an one SENECA makes report he knew,
who could not endure to be without his wives company, one minute of an hour:
and if upon necessity he went abroad into the town, yet would he take with
him a stomacher of hers, and wear it ever next his heart, etc.

( c) No doubt the same was garnished with Gold, rich stones and precious
pearls. See Pli^. lib. ^9. cap. 35.

( d) It may be gathered it was Hemiplegia, which we call the dead Palsy,
taking the one side of the body, and most commonly ensuing upon an Apoplexy,
if it were not the very Apoplexy it self, (which is none other but an
universal palsy) considering the quick dispatch it made.

( a) He means the crew, o^ faction of chariotiers 7
holding of the blew or watchet color: which Vitellius and Galba both affected.

( a) So called, of an unfortunate ba^taile fought 11
that day near the river Allia: in which, the Romans were overthrown by the
French: who following the train of their victory, advanced their ensigns to
Rome, forced the City, and put it to the sack.

( b) Some read De D^minico. i. out of Dominicus, for so it may seem, was the
book of NEROES Canticles entitled, allnding to himself, who would be called
Rerum Dominus. i. Lord of the world.

( a) CORNELIUS CELSVS finds no fault 13
with Asclepi^des, who condemned vom^ng, Offensus eorum consuet^dine, qui
qua^ie ^ciendo (...) facultatem ^liuntur. i. as utterly disliking their manner,
who by daily casting up their gorge, seek to enable themselves for beastly
gourdma^dise. And to the same purpose he says: Istud luxuria causa fieri ^on
op^tere. 1. That this ought not to be put in use, for to maintain riotous
excess. He admonishes also, Ne quis qui valere and senes^ere volet, hoc
qu^idianum faciat. That no man who desiret^ to live long and in health would
make it a daily practice. But Seneca reproves such very aptly in these words,

Edunt ut vomant, vomunt ut edant.

They eat, to vomit, and they vomit, to eat.

( b) If Scarus were not the guilt head, a delicate ^ish no doubt it was in
those days, and better esteemed than the Acipeaser. i. the Sturgion. It
cheweth cud, and has plain teeth to grind withal, not indented like a comb

And not far from the said lodge, such a dog, with a chain, was usually
painted upon the wall, with these words, in great letters,

CAVE, CAVE CANEM, i. BEWARE, BEWARE THE DOG.

( a) He means that Gallus Gallinaceu^, or 18
dunghill cock, that before had perched upon his head and shoulders, alluding

were delivered by word of mouth unto those that stood next, or in writing, and
so passed through the camp, it mattereth not.

( b) It may appear, that Getulicus their former General, had allowed his
Soldiers more liberty and pastime.

viniger or Austere wine, with salt put thereto, and afterward well driven and
wrought together in manner of Felt, became so stiff, an and Armor of so good
proof, (...) i. as that it would check the dint of any dart or shot
whatsoever.

As touching the Soldier thus reprooved by GALBA, it was JULIUS ATTICVS, as
TACITUS writes, one of those who went under the name of Spiculatores. i.
Bill-men: or Speculatores rather, as some would have it, employed in Espiall,
executions, etc. as has before been noted. Here also in the clause, Dimota
paga^ turba, is to be understood the multitude of the people and common sort,
who were not Soldiers. For so Paga^ are taken, as in opposition to Milites.

THESE Aurei among the Romans, were 20
valued at one hundred Sestertii a piece, so as in round reckoning they may go
for our old EDWARD Star-Reals, or fifteen shilling pieces. For, by exact
computation, one of them arises to fifteen shillings, seven pence half
penie, The fourth part just, of the Roman pound, (containing one hundred
Deniers or Atticke Drachmes) which makes three pound, two shillings six pence
starling.

that unknowen God unto them, who reigns for ever.

( b) This sight, and the other following, betokened loveraigntie unto
Vespasian, who warred then in the East countries, Iudaea and Syria.

( a) This Basilides seems rather to have been 7
some Priest, or principal man of note, and not Libertus, i. his sreed man, as

dissignement of VESPASIAN, Nomen and omen erat,

( a) Out of the 35 Tribes of Rome, were chosen certain Judges or
Commissioners, named Centumviri, 10
to wit, out of every Tribe three, and albeit their number arose to an hundred
and five, yet roundly they went for an hundred, and so were called. These I
say, being ordained Selitibus judicandis, determined private and civil matters
between man and man, de Testamentis, Stillicidijs, and such like of no great
moment. They put forth or erected a spear in the place where they late in

battle.

( a) This is reprehended by Cornelius Celsus. lib. 2. 19

eyes, forehead, face, etc. to tell ones nature and disposition: such an one as
ZOPTRVS was, who noted SOCRATES for to be by natural inclination a wanton
lover of women: but a fortune teller, by looking on the forehead only. Such as
in these days, by the art of Palmestrie, for sooth, can assure folk, how long
they shall live, and what not? If they do but see lines in the palms of their
hands, or by feaxe in the forehead, will say, how many wives a man shall have?

( a) DOING them thus much credit in the 8
eyes of the world, as to give the allowance and approbation, or otherwise, of
the weapons wherewith they should fight. For, in this sense may Ornaments be
taken: the rather, because some copies have Ferramenta. Or this place may be
understood of other furniture, as well as ar^es, wherewith they should come
appointed into the listes.

( a) THIS has been observed in all ages, to 9
fore-runne the death of some Prince. Thus, before the end of Julius Caesar, as
Virgil writes,

Non alias lat^ c^ciderunt pl^ra (...) Fulgura, etc.

Horace likewise.

-- Per puri^ (...) Egit equos v^lueremque currum.

Our own a little before the death of king Henry the sec^d.
Chronicles also exemplify no less. To say nothing of the fresh resemblance
of that, which happened with us three years since, in July.

( a) SOME write, and (...) by 10
name, that he was poisoned with eating of Seahares.

ANNOTATIONS UPON Flavius Domitianus.
( a) THIS was some Satyricall 1
Poem, of which IVV^NALIS writes thus:

-- Improbior satyra^ scribente Cin^do. ^. Nerone

( b) A vestment of white linen, after the manner of a Surplice: for such
priests thereupon were name^ Li^igeri.

( a) TOGA Cr^canica. Which is spoken (...), 4
pro chlamyde. i. a cloak or loose cafsocke. For Toga was Romanorum.

( a) PHILOSTRATVS alleges another reason 7
of this Edict, namely for that many seditious broils and commotions were
occasioned by drunkenness.

( b) Or rather, as Cas^s expounds [ geminari castra] that two le^ions should
not encampe in one leaguer. For, the policy of war found the same always
dangerous, in regard of mu^nics, that by occasion thereof might (...)
Soul^iers, as Di^ writes, (...). i. Seeing their own numbers great, grow to
be stout and malapert.

( c) For, before time, it was thought good Policy, that soldiers should lay
up a portion of their donative, about the Ensigns within the camp, and not
spend all their stock, (which commonly they are given unto,) whereby they
might be put in mind to fight more valiantly, and not to forsake their
colors, so long as they had somewhat to save or loose.

( a) NAMELY, to be buried quick under the 8
ground, that is to say, to be let down into some grot or vault, and there to
be sterved to death.

( a) PATREM-PAMILIAS. i. A good honest 10
Citizen of Rome, such as came to behold the Games.

( b) Under these Tyrannical Emperors of Rome, that ^avorized, some this
faction of ^encers and Chariot-riders, others that, it was high Trea^on and
Impiety, for men to speak a word, not in open place only and in the Theater,
but also at home in their houses, even in table talk, in commendation of the
adverse faction, by way of comparison. Martial inviting a friend to his bourd,
and promising that no m^rth and free speech at meat should turn him to any
danger and displeasure, writes thus unto him,

De Prasin^ conviva meus venit^que loquatur:
Noc sacient quenquam pocul^ nostra reum.
Now, it is to be understood, that Domitius affected the fensers called
Mirmillones, against the others named Thraces or Threces, whom his brother
TITUS favored.

( c) By Parmularius understand, him that speaks favorably in the behalf of
those fencers, named Parmularii, of the little bucklers, wherewith they were
armed: otherwise called Threces, (as one would say Thracians, whose armature
they had) in opposition of others which were the Mirmillones, who were
otherwise appointed after the French fashion, and therefore took the name
otherwhiles of Gall^, and so is that verse of Horace to be expounded. Thrax an
Gallina Syro par? As touching blasphemic, no mervaile, if these Tyrants taking
upon them to be Gods here upon earth, held every word derogatorie any ways
unto their Majesty, high Treason and Impiety.

( d) Domitian and other such monsterous Tyrants, as namely CALIGVLA, envied
all persons and things that were excellent. It behooved therefore La^ia to be
silent, and to dissimule what he thought, as well as he might: although, for
grief of heart, happily, he could not choose but fetch a secret sigh to
himself with a He^ i. Helas.

( a) I observe a double acception of this word 12
CAESAR, in this History penned by SV^TONIVS. First for a noble house in Rom^
whereof JULIUS CAESAR DICTATOR was descended. Whose line, either in blood or by
adoption, were called Caesares. And in this sense it is truly said, that
Progenies C^sarum in N^rone defecit. i. that the race of the (...) was extinct
in Ner^. And in this sense the ^eires apparent of the Emperors in that line
were named Caesar's. Secondly for all the Sovereign Emperors of Rome after
Julius Caesar. So Gal^a and the rest, his successors were styled Cesares.

( b) This exaction levied of the Jews, which he calls Iudaicum fiscum, was
for the profession and exercise of the religion within Rome: who, as Xiphilinus
witnesses, were permitted before, by Vespas^an his father to observe the ri^es
and ceremonies of their own religion, paying an yearly Tribute, to wit, a
Didr^hme. i. two Roman ^eniers, or fifteen pence with us. And so the
Christians afterward for a time had the same Indulgence.

( a) IN some copies are inserted these words, 15
Aream and Calvitium, to ^osense, unless ye would have him thereby noted, ^or
his (...) and fall of hay^e, which some Physcians call Area.

( b) This FLAVIVS CLEMENS, is thought to have been a Proselite, and convert
to the lewish ^r Christianity rather
Religion, by reason whereof, being somewhat mortified, and making conscience
to do evil, he was reputed base minded, and as SVETONIVS says, (...) inertia.
Imputations charged by Paganes upon Christians, and the true servants of God,
for their quiet carriage and modest behavior.

( ^) Whose son, I would (...) else, he would be thought, as who put one to
(...), (...) in his public prayers he had not made mention of him, as the
son of Minerva, Philostratus. lib. 7.

( a) Little Images, which Paini^s devoutly kept 17
and worshipped, (as the Tutelare Gods of their bedchamber) within a certain
Closet called L^rium.

( a) IT may be thought by the circumstance of 18
this place, that this Rub^r vultus in Domitian, was a tincture of virtue and
modesty. But there was nothing less in him, so that it was rather an
hypocritical visard and mask, under which was couched a most fell and cruel
nature, as being by the judgment of Tacitus more sanguinarie than Nero. For
whereas Nero, (...) (...), (...) (...), (...) spectavit, s^b (...) (...) (...)
(...) (...) videri and aspi^i, c^ (...) (...) (...) pall^ibus, suff^eres
sav^ille (...) (...) and (...), quo se (...) (...) (...). A (...) red therefore
is n^ always a sign of grace.

( a) AT Alexandria in Egypt, was that famous 20
Library of King Ptole^ Philadelph^s and the other Ptol^es his progeni^ and
successors, con^yning to the number well near of 700000 books. A^l. (...)
N^st. Attic (...) (...). 17.

( a) ACCLAMATIONS must be restrained hee^ to the worse sense, for all manner
of Curses 23
and Detestations, such as before were taken up by the people in this time,
Tiber^ in Tiberim, and afterward by the Senate, against (...), that wicked
Emperor, in these terms, Hosts patrie honores detra^antur, paricida (...),
hostis deorum, carnife^ senatus unco trahetur, i^ spoli^rio p^natur, etc.

( b) Nerva, Traianus, Hadrianus, etc. Of whom, Sextus Aurelius writes thus.
Quid Nerva prudenti^s aut moderatius? Qui^ Tra^ divinius? Quid prastantius
Hadriano?
