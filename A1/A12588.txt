This is the dyalogus or co^munyng betwxt the wise king Solomon and Marcolphus.





Here begins the dyalogus or comynicacion betwixt Solomon the king of
jherusale^ and Marcolphus that right rude and great of body was bnt right
subtle and wise of wit / and full of vndresta^dyng. as thereafter following men

Upon a season hertofore asking salomo^ full of wisdom and richesse: sat upon
the kings sete or stole that was his fadres davyd: saw coming a man out of
theste that was named marcolphus. of vysage greatly myshapen and foul
nevyrthelesse he was right talkatyf elloquend and wise. His wif had he with him

Rownde feet. and the nose thycke and crooked. a face like an ass: and the here

Re^ning yen: berdyd like a goet her vysage and skyn black and full of

She had short fyngres. full of yreuryngys. Se had right great nosethrylles Her
leggys short. and hery like a bear her clothes were rough and broken / of such
a woman or of an othre like unto hyre: a yongeman has made thies verses

Sed turpis nimirum turpe ferat vicium

That is to say an evyll favouryd and a foul black wife behovyth to show the
days light.

It is to our yes medycyne to se that fair is and fine

no king were no law is

Onys upon a time the king rode an huntyng with his hunterys and ho wndes and
fortuned him to come by the house of marcolf: And turnyd him self thid rewards
with his horse and demanded with his head inclyned under the dorre bow. who
was wythin^. Marcolf a^sweryd to the king: within is an hool, man and an half.
and an horse head / and the more that they ascend the more they down fall To
that spak salomo^ what menyst thou therwithall / Tho a^sweryd marcolphus The
hole man is my self syttyng within / ye are the half man syttyng without upon
your horse lokyng in with your head declynedy. And the horse head is the head
of your horse that ye sytte on: Than Solomon demauuded of Marcolphus what they
were that clyme^ up and fallyn down.


Marcol: Answered and said: they are the benys boyllyng in the pott Salom^ /
where is thy fadyr: thy modyr / thy Sustyr / and thy brothyr /


Mar My fadyr is in the field and makyth of oon harm two My modyr is goon and
does to her neighborwe that she nevyr more shall do / my brothyr lytting
without the house steyth all that he fyndeth My sustyr syttyth in hire.
Chamber and be wepyth that a fore time she laughyd.


Salom^ What betokenth they


Mar: My fadyr is i^ the field and puttyth or settyth thornys in a foot path /
and coming men they make an othre path thereby / and so he makyth of oon harm
two My modyr is goon and closyth the yes of her neyghborwe deying the which
she shall hevyr more do My brothyr sytting without the house i^ the son and
lo wsyth and all that he fyndeth he sleyth My sustyr / the last year lovyd a
young man and with kyssyng / laughi^g / tastyng: japyng and playing: she was
getyn with child: whereof she now travayllyth / and that now she bewepyth sore:


Solomon How comyth to the all this wisdom and subtyltye /


Marcolfus In the time of king david your fadyr there was a yongema^ his
phisicia^. and as he onys had takyn a vulture for to occupye in his me dicins /
and had takyn thereof that was to him expedye^t So took your modyr Barsebea the
heart and leyde it upon a cruste of breed and rostyd it upon the fair / and
yave you the heart to ete / and I tha^ne being in the kechi^ she kast at my
head the cruste through moysted with therte of the vulture: and that ete j and
thereof I suppose is come^ to me my subtlety like as to you is comen by etyng
of therte wysedom.


Salomo^ As verely^ god help the. jn gabaa good appiercyd to me and fulfilled
me with sapie^ce: Marcolphus He is holdyn wise that reputyth him self a fool:


Sa. Haste thou not herd what richesse god has yevyn me aboven that wisdom


Mar. I have herd it And i know well that where god woll / there reynyth if.
To that said salomo^ all laughyngly / my folkys wait / upon me without j may
no leugyr with the talk / but say to thy modyr that she send me of her best
cow a pot full of milk and that the pot of the same cow be coveryd and
bring thou it to me:


Marcolphus It shall be done. King solomon with his company rydyng to wardys
jerusalem was honorably receyvyd as a rich and most puyssa^t king. And when
floscemy a marcolphus modyr was common home to her house / he deed to her the
kings message Tha^ she taki^g a pot full with milk of her cow / and coveryd
it with a flawne of the same milk made. and sent it so forth to the king by
her sone as marcolphus went ovyr the field the wethir was warm of the son
saw lying there a dry bakyn cow torde: and for haste he uneath cowde set
down the pot to the earth but that he had etyn the fsawne / and took up the
cow torde. and therwyth covyrd the pot: And so covyrd presentyd it before the
king. and he asked why is the pot thus covyrd.


Marcolf My lord have not ye commanded that the milk should becovyrd of the
same cow / Salo. I commanded not so to be done:


Mar. Thus I vndyrstode /


Sal. It had been bettyr coveryd with a fsawne made with the milk of the same
Low.


Mar. So was it furste done / but hu^gyr chamigyd wit


Sal How:


Marc. I wyste well that ye had no need of mete / and I havyng great hu^gyr ete
the fsawne with milk anyonted and for that with wit chungyd the pot I have
thus coveryd with a cow torde.


Sal now leve me all this. and if that thou this night wake not aswele as I:
thou may have no trust to morn of thy head. Salomo^ and maccolph consentyd
both. and within a little while aftyr marcolph began to rowte / Salo. said
marcolf thou stepyst:


Marcolph answered. Lord I do not I think /


Solomon / what thinkyst thon /


Marcolf I think that there are as many joyntys in the tail of an hare / as I
hire chyne:


Salomo^ if thou prove not that to morn thou art worthy to deye Solomon being
stylle / began marcolph to sleep: again and said to him / thou slepyst And he
answered I do not / for I think /


Solomon what thynkest thou /


Marcolphus / I think that the pie has as many white fethrys as black.


Salomo But thou also prove that true thou shall lefe thyn head / As solomon
again began to be still le


Marcolph began again terowte and to blow And Salomo^ said to him thou slepyst
/

Marcolphus Nay I think /


Solomon / What think thou /


Marcolph I think that under therhe is no clerer thing than the / day


Salom^ Is the day clerer than milk /


Marcolph Ie / Salomo^ That must thou prore. Anon hervpon began marcolphus to
sleep.


Salo. Thou slepyst


Mar / I sleep not but I muse


Solomon What musyst thou.


Marcolph I muse how that men may not surely trust the women.


Solomon And that of the shawe provyd Anon aftyr as Solomon was srylle began
marcolf again to blow and to sleep. Salomo Thou slepyst.


Marcolph do not but I think /


Salomo^ What think thou


Marcoph I think how that nature goth before lernyng:


Solomon: If thou prove not that true thou shall lose thyn head / A ftyr that
the night was ovyr passyd and solomon very of waking put him self to rest Than
marcolf left the king and ran hastily to his sustyr Fudasa: and feigned himself
forwefull. and hevy. and said to hyre: The king Solomon is against me / and I
may not bear his threytys and ininries: and but I shall take this knyf / and
hyde it secretly vndyr my clothes / and there with this day all pryuely he not
knowing I shall smite him to therte and sle him: now good dear sustyr I pray
the accuse me not but iu any wise keep it secret ne show it not to mine own
brothyr Bufrydo / Fudasa answered my dear and leevest brothyr Marcolf put no
doubts therein I had levyr dye and be brent at a stake rather tha I should
discovre it or accuse the / Aftyr that retouruyd marcolf all pryvely towardys
the kings Court The son rysyng and spredyng her beamys ovyr there the
jllnmined and fulfyllyd the ki^gys palayce: and salamon rysyng from his bed
went and sat in the trone or sete of his palayce Than commanded he to bring
to fore him an hare. and asmany joyntes iu his tail as in his chyne were
fownden by marcolph and nombredys Thanne was there apye brought before the king
/ and asmany white fethrys as black were fownden by marcolph And tha^ne took
marcolph a great pan with milk and set it in the kings bed chamber all
pryvely. and closd to all the wyndowes that no light might in come Thanne
kallyd he the king into the chamber / And as he come in he stumblyd at the
pan and was nygh fallyn therein Tho was the king angry and displeased/ and
said thou foul evyl body / what is it that thou do


Marcolphus a^sweryd ye ought not herefore to be angry. For have ye not said
that milk is clerer than the day How is it that ye se not aswele by the
clerenesse of the milk as ye do by the clerenesse of the day juge egaly and
ye shall find that I have nothing mysdone unto you


Solomon God foryene the. my clothys be all with milk sprongyn And nygh I had
my neck brokyn and yet thou haste me nothing trespasyd


Marcolphus a^sweryd a^othre time se bettyr to fore youlnevyrhtelesse sytte
down and do me justyce upon a matter that I shall show before you: When he was
set Marcolph complained and showed Lord I have a sustyr that has to name
Fudasa and she has yeuen hyrself to horedam and is with child wherwyth she
shamyth and dishonesty dalle our blood and lynage: and yet would she part
with me in my fathres good and heritage Thanne said Solomon Let her come a
fore us: And we shall here her what she woll say herto. As Solomon saw her
come from far said all laughyngly This may well be Marcolphus sustyr This
fudasa was short and thyeke and thereto was she great with child and thus was
she thycker tha^ she was of lenghthe She had thycke leggys and short. and went
on bote lame / with vysage / yen and stature lycke to Marcolph. Solomon said
to Marcolph / What complaynest or askyst thou af thy sustyr. Marcolph answered
My lord I complain and show opynly before you of my sustyr that she is a
strong harlot and a strumpet and is with child. as ye may se and all our
blood and kynrede by her is shamyd. that wythstandyng she would dele and part
with me in my fathres good and heritage Wherefore I require you of justice. and
that ye command hire that she take no part ne make no claim thereto. This
heryng Fudas^ replete with anger and woednesse cried on high and said: Thou
foul mysshapyn harlot wherefore should not I have my part in our fadres good
and heritage. and is not Floscemya mother to us bote:

Marcoph Thou shall not have any dele or part therein For thin offe^se iugeth
the clearly therfro / Fudasa Therefore I may not lose mine heritage. For have j
mysdone I shall amend it / but oon thing I promise the and swear by god and
all his might. if thou wylt not let me be in pease: and suffer me to have my
parthe in the land. I shall show such a thing of the. that the king or it be
night shall do the to behangyd:


Marcolphus. Thou foul stynkyng hoar. what kanst thou say of me I have no man
mysdone / say thy worste I dyffye the / thou haste much misdone thou foul
facyd knave and rybaulde that thou art. For thou gladly woldyst sle the king /
and if ye beleve not me seek vndyr his cote and ye shall find the knyf Tho was
the knyf sought by the kings seruau^tys and it was not fownde-Sayde marcolph
to the king and to the aboutestanders. And have I not said truth: that men
should not put ovyrmoche trust or co^fide^ce in the women. with that they all
began to laughe^


Tho said salomo^. Marcolph Thou do all thy things by craft and subtyltye
Marcolph a^sweryd Lord it is no subtyltye. but that my sustyr had promised me
to have kept it secret / and she has falsely discoverd it as though it had been of a truth. Solomon / wherefore haste thou said that art or nature. goth
before lernyng Marcolph Take pacyence a little and before or ye go to bed I
shall show you The day passyd ovyr and the time of souper came on. The king sat
to sowper and othre. With whom sat marcolph. and had all pryvely put unto his
sleve three quyk myse There was norysshyd in the kings house a Catte* that
every night as the king sat at sowper. was wont to hold betwyxt hyre fore feet
a brennyng ka^dell upon the tabyll. Thanne let marcolphoon of the myse go out
of his sleve. As the catte that saugh she would have lept aftyr: but the king
ya uc her a wynke or countenance that she bode stylle syttyng and removyd not.
and in like wise deed she of the secunde mowse / Thanne let marcolph the
thrydde mowse go: and as the katte saw he cowde no longer abide. but kaste the
ka^dell away and lept aftyr the mowse and took it And as marcolph that saw:
said to the king Here I have now provyd before you that nature goth before
lernyng: Tho commanded Solomon his servants. have this man out of my syghte:
and if he come hythre any more / set my howndes upon him.

Marcolphus: now for certain I know and may say that where as the head is
seek and evyll at ease / there is no law


As marcolph was thns out dryven: he seyde to him self / neythre so nor so
shall the wise Solomon of marcolf be quyte. on the next morning following as he
was out of his couche or kenel risen he bethoughte him in his mind how he
might best get him again into the kings court without hurt or devouryng of
the howndes he went and bought a quyk hare and put it under his clothis and
yede again to the court And when the kings servants had syghte of him they
let upon him all the howndes and forthwyth he cast the hare from him: and the
howndes aftre. and left marcolph. and thus came he again be the king And as he
saw him he asked who had letyn him in / Marcolph a^sweryd with great sutyltie
am j in come^. Sal Beware that this day thou spytte not but upon the bare
grownde: The palayce was all coveryd with tapettys. and the walls ha^gyd with
rich clothys. Marcof within short space aftyr / with his talkyng and clateryng
with othre his mouth was full of spytyll began to cough and reche up /
beholding alaboute him where he might best spytte and cowd find no bare earth:
saw a ballyd man stondyng by the king barehedyd and spatyld evyn upon his
forehede. The ballyd man was therwyth ashamyd made clean his forehede: and fill
on kneyes before the kingys fete and made a complaynt upon marcolph. Salomo^
Wherefore haste thou made foul the forehede of this man. Mar. I have not made
it foul but j have dungyd it or made it fat. for on a bareyne grownde. it
behovyth du^ge to be laid. that the corn that is thero^ so wyn may the bettyr
grow and multiplye. Saolmon What is that to this man. Mar. My lord have ye not
forbedyn me that this day I should not spytte but upon the bare earth and I
saw his forehede all bare of herys: and thynkyng it (...) vare earth. and
therefore I spyttyd upon it The king shall not be angry for this thing for i
have done it for the manys proffyte for and if his so rehede were thus vsyd to
be made fat the herys should aven increase and multiplye. Salo. God give the
shame for the ballyd men aught to be aboue^ othre men in honure. for
balyo^nesse is no shame but a beginning. of worship^. Marcolphus / Balydnesse
is a flies nest Behold j not fire how the flies follow more hie forehede tha^
all the othre that been within this house. for why they trowe^ that it be a
vessel turnyng full wythsom good dri^ke or else to be a stone anointed with
any sweet thing. and therefore they haste thaym to his bare forehede To this
said the ballyd man before the king: Whereto is this most vile rybaulde suffered
in the kings presence us to rebuke and shame. let him be kast out. Marcolph /
and be it pease in thy virtue / and j shall be stylle. herewythall come in two
women bryngyng with thaym a lyving child / for the wyche they before the king
began to stryve: For the oon said it be lo^gyd to hyre / but the oo^ of thaym
had forlayne hyre child slepyng So that they were mstryre for the levying
child / Salomo^ said to oon of his servauntis: take a sword and depart this
child in two pecys: and yeve either of thaym the oon half / That heryng the
natural bodyr of the lyvyng child: said to the king Lord j beseech you jeve
it to that woman all hool lyvyng / for the his the verraye modyr thereof. Than
said Salomo^ that she was the modyr of the child* and yave it to hire /
Marcolph demanded of the king how he the modyr knew. Solomon By chaungyng of
her colure and affection and by effusyo^ of tetys / Marcolphus ye myghthe so
bedisceyved / for believe ye the weeping of the women / and are so wise and know
the craft of thaym no bettyr / whyllys a woman wepyth she laughyth with therte
/ They kan weep with oon yie / and lawgh with the othyr. They make contenan^ce
with the vysage that they think not They speak with the tu^ge that they mean
not with therte They promise many times that they parforme not-bnt they change
their contenaunces as their minds run / The women have innumerable crafts
/ Solomon As many crafts as they have / so many good condicyons and propyrtyes
they have / Marcolphus Say not good condicyons or propyrtyes. but say
shrewdnessys and decepcyons. Solomon Surely she was an hoar that bare snche a
sone. Marcolph Wherefore say ye so* Solomon For thou blamyst all women / and
they are honest chaste meke loving and curtayse / Marcolf To that might ye add
and say that they are brotyll and mutable. Salomo^ If they be brotyll: that
have they of manys condicyo^ / if they be change able that have they by
delectaciou^: Woman is though made of ma^nys rybbe / and yeven unto him for his
help and comfort For woman is asmoche to say as a weyke earth or a weyke
thing / Mar: jn likewise it is asmoche to say as a soft error / Sal There
lie thou false kaytyf Thou must nedys be cryll and onhappy* that say so
much shame and harm of women For of women we are all comen / and therefore he
that seyth evyll of the kind of women is greatly to be blamyd for what is
richesse / wat is kingdoms / what is possessions what is goold what is sylver
what is costely clothyng or p^ciouse stonys* what is costely metys or drinks.
what is good company or solace what is myrthe whitoute women. On truth they
may kalle well the world deed that from women are exiled or banysshed For women
must bear the children they feed and norysshe thaym up / and love thaym well
She desyryth thayre helthys She gouernyth the household. She forwyth the health
of her husband and household. women is the dilectaco^n of all things: she is
the swetnesse of youth She is the solace of joye of age. She is gladness of
children: She is joye of the day She is solace of the night She is the gladynd
of labor. of all hevynesses. she is the forgeter She servyth whithoute
grutchyng And she shall watch my going out and mine incomyng. Thereupon answered
marcolphus. he seyth truth. that thinkyth with his heart. as he spekyth with
his mowth. ye have the women in great favor / and therefore ye praise thaym.
Richesse nobylnesse / fayrenesse and wysedom be in you. and therefore it
behovyth you to love women. but y assure you one thing albe it that ye now
praise thaym ovyr much / or ye sleep ye shall dysprayse thaym as fast. Salomo^
Thereof thou shall lie / for all my lyve days I have lovyd women and shall
during my life. But now go from me / and se well to. that before me thou nevyr
speak evyll of women Than marcolphus going out of the kings palayce. kallyd to
him the woman that had her child to hyre yeven a ye^ by the king and said to
hyre knowyst thou not what is done and concluded in the kingys counsel to
day. She answered my child is yevyn me aye^ alyve / what else there is done.
that know not I. Tho said marcoph the king has commanded and is vttyrly
determined that to morwe thou and thy felawe shall come again before him: and
that thou shall have the one half of thy child and thy felawe the othre half
Tha^ said the woman O what evyll king / and what false and untrue sentence
yevyth he. Marcoph said yet shall j show the grettyr matiers and more
chargeable and of grettyr weyghte The king and his counsel has ordained that
evyr man shall have vij. wyves therefore remember and think what therein is best
to be done. for as one man has vij. wyves. so shall there nevyr. more be rest
or pease in thouse. one shall be belovyd an othre shall displease him for her
that he lovyth shall be most with him: and the othre nevyr or seldom She shall be
well clothyd and the othre shall be forgetyn: her that he lovyth best shall have
ryngys jo wellys goold sylvyr furs and were fylkys She shall keep tije keys

And if he love tweryne: what shall the othre v. say and if he love three what
shall say the othre iii. and if he love iiij* what shall the othre iij. do etc.
That he lovyth best he shall always have by him and kiss hire and half hyre
The othyr shall mow say that they are neythre wydowes nor weddyd nor yet
vnweddyd. nor without husband They shall mow well forthynke that they have
their mayndehede lost There shall evyr stryff anger envye and brawelyng
reign and if there be not fownde a remedy herefore many great inconvenyencys
shall grow there of And by cause that thou art a woman and well acqueynted
with the condicyons of women: haste the and show this to all the ladies and
women within this city and advyse thaym that they ^sente not to it in any
wise. but wythstande it. and say against the king and his counseyll. Marcolf
returned and went again to the court and pryvely hyd him in a corner And the
woman trowyd his wordys to be true. ra^ne trough the city and clappyd hire
handys to gydre and cried with opyn mowthe and showed all that she had herd and
more And each neyghborwe or gossyp said it forth to an othre / So that in
short time there was a great assemble or gaderyng of women well nigh that all
the women that weren within the City. and se gadred went to the kings palayse
well by the nombre of.vj.M^. women / and brak up dorys and ovyr went the king
and his counsel with great malice and loud crying: The king as he this herd
/ avyd what the cause was of thayre gaderyng. To that oon woman that wyser and
more eloquent than the othre: said unto the king. Most mighty prince to whom
goold / sylver* preciouse stones and all richesse of the world tho you are
brought ye do ane thing as ye woll. and non ayensayth your pleasure: ye have a
Queen and many Quenys. and oryr that ye have co^cubynes or paramours without
nombre or as asmany as you pleasyth for ye have all that ye wol: So may not
every man d^ Solomon answered God has anointed and made me king in jsrahel may
I not than do and accomplyssh all my will Do your will wy^^ your own. and
meddle not with us. We are of the noble blood of Abraham and hold moses law /
Wherefore woll ye thane that change and altre ye are bownden to do right and
justice. wherefore do ye unright. Tho said Salomo^ with great vnpacyence. Thou
sham full wife what unright or wrong do y She a^swryd: as great unright do ye
as ka^ be thought or ymagined For ye have ordained that every man shall have
mow lawefully vij. wynes / and certaynli that shall not be: For there is not
that prince / duke / or earl / that so rich and puyssaunt is / but that oo^
woman alone shall mow fullfylle. all his desires and will. what thanne should
he do with.vij. wyves: it is aboven any mannys might or power: It were bettyr
ordained that oon woman should have vij. husbondes Than said Salomo^ all
laughyngly I had not trowed that of men had been fewer in nombre than of women
Tho kryed all the women as mad people with out any reason / ye are anevyle
king and your sentences ben false and unrightful Now may we well here and se
that it is truth that we have herd of you: and that ye have of us said
evyll: and thereto ye skorue and mock us before our vysages that we se it O
lord god who was so evyle as saul that regnyd ouyr us furste yet davyd was
worse / and now this Salomo^ werst of all than the king being full of wrath
said There is no head more worse than the serpent / and there is no malice to
the malice of a woman: for it were bettyr to dvelle with serpentys and lyo^s /
tha^ with a wicked woman All evyll are but lytyl tho the cursydnesse: of a
shrewd woman All wyckydnesse fall upon women / as the sand fallyth in the
shoes fo the oolde people going up an hylle So a talkatyf woman and
dishobedye^t is a great confusyon That wife that is hlr husbondes master is
evyr contrary to him An evyl wife makyth a pacient heart. and a sorry vysage and
if as plage of the death A woman was the beginning of sin / and through hire
we dye all The woman that is luxuriouse may men known in the vppermest of
hire yes. and by her brows For hire yes are without revyre^ce and there need
noma^ wondre although she forgete her husbonde As the king althus had said. so
spaknathan the prophet and said My lord why rebuke ye and shame ye thus all
thies women of iherusale^. Salomo^ have ye not herd what dishonor they have
said of me without deservyng Na than answered he that woll with his subgiettys
lyve in rest and pease / he must some time be blind du^me. and deef. Salomo^.
it is to be a^sweryd to a fool aftyr his folysshnes. Tho spra^ge Marcolph out
of the corner that he sat in / and said to the king / now have ye spokyn aftyr
mine intent. for ones this day ye praised women out of all mesure / and now
have ye dispraysed thaym asmoche. that is it that I sought: always ye make my
saying true: Salo. Thou foul evyle body / knowyst thou of this co^mocion:
Marcolph/ nay. nevyr thelesse ye should not give credence to all thing that ye
here Tho said the king salomo^ go from hens out of my syghte: and I charge the

kings palayse / Than^ they that stode^ by the king sayde^: mylord speak to
thief women sumwhat that may please thaym to here. to thente^t that they may
depart Than turnyd the king toward thaym and said your goodness shall
vndrestande. that I am not to be blamyd in that: that ye lay to my charge /
That evyl sayer marcolf / that ye here late saw. has out of him self all
this matter surmysed and feigned: and every man shall have his own wife and her
with faith and honesty love and cherysshe That I have spokyn against the wyves
I have not said it but against the froward wyves who should of the good wyves
speak any evyll For a good wife makyth her husband glad and blythe with hyre
goodness She is a part the lyryng of hyre husbond upon earth. and her lernyng
advauntagyth or forthryth his body She is a yifte of god / A wise wife and a
stylle is a grace abouen graces / A good shame fast and an honest wife is like
the son clymmyng up to god. A wife of good condioyons is the ornament or
apparayle of the house. She is a light shynyng bryghther / than the light of
ca^deliys: She is like the goolden pyller standing upon her feet and an ovyr
fast fnndament grwnded upon a sure stone wythonte mutacions and the command
mantys of god evyr in her mind / The heoly god of Israhel bless you and
multiplye your sede and kyndre bid / unto the end of the world Tho said
they all / ame^: And took leve of the king and went their weyes: Marcoph
beryng in his mind of the unkindness that the king had commanded him that he
should no more so him betwixt the yes Thought in himself. what was best to do.
It happened that the next night following fill a great snow Marcolphus took a
little Cyve or Temse in his oon hand and a foot of a bear in the othre hand:
and he turned his shoes tyat stood forwards upon his feet bakward and upon the
morning erly he began to go like a best upon all four feet through the
street. and when he was comen a little wythouthe the town: he fownde an old
ovyn and crept into it. And as the light of the day was on comen. oon of the
kingys seruauntys found the footstappys of marcolph. and thougt that it was
the trace or stappys of and merveylous best and in all haste went and showed
it to the king Tha^ne incontinent with huntres and howndes he went to hunte
and seek the said wondrefull beeste and followed it unto they comen before the
oven where they had lost and fownde no more of the steppys. The king Solomon
descended from his horse and began to look into the oven. Marcolpus lay all
crokyd his vysage from him wards. had put down his breche into his hammes
that be might se his ars hole and all his othre foul gere. As the king
Salomo^ that seeing demawnded what lay there. Mar. a^sweryd j am here: Sal
wherefore lie thou thus / Marcolf. for ye have commannded me that ye should
no more se me betwyxt mynyes Now and ye woll not se me betwyxt mynyes: ye may se
me between my buttockys in the mids of mine arsehole: Than was the king sore
meovyd commanded his seruauntys to take him and hang him vpona tree / Mar. So
takyn. said to the king: Mylord well it please you to yeve me leave to chose
the tree whereupon that j shall ha^ge Salsayde be it as thou haste de syred / for
it forcyth not on what tree that thou be hangyd / Than the kings servants
toke^ and leddyn marcolph without the city / and through the vale of
iosaphath and ovyr the hyghte of the hylle of olyuete from theus to ierirho.
and cowde find no tree that marcolf would chese to be hanged on From thens went
they ovyr the flome iordane and all arabye through And so forth all the great
wilderness unto the read see: And nevyrmore cowde marcolph find a tree that he
would chese to hang on And thus he askapyd out of the dawnger and hands of
king salomo^ / and turnyd again unto his house / and levyd in pease and joy And
so mote we all do aboven with the fadre of heven Amen
