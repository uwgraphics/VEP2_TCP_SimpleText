Boecius de consolacione philosophy
C^imina qui quandam studio florente peregi Flebilis heu mestos cogor inire
modos
ALlas I weeping am constrained to begin verse of soroufull matere. That whylom
in flourisshing study made delitable ditees / For lo rendyng muses of poets
enditen to me things to be written / And drery verse of wretchidnes weten my
face with very teeris / At last no dread ne might onercome tho muses that
they ne weren felawes and folowden my way / that is to say. When I was exiled
/ They that weren of my yongthe whilom weleful and gr^^e conforten now sorouful
wierdes of me old man For elde is comen unwarily upon me hasted by the harms
that I have. And sorrow has commanded his age to be in me. Heeres hoar arn
shadde ouertymeliche upon my heed. And the slack skin trembles of mine emptid
body. Thilke death of men is weleful that ne comes not in yeris that be sweet /
but comes to wretchis often y cleped. Allas Allas with how deef an ere death
cruel torneth away fro wretches. and nayeth for to close weeping eyes. while
fortune unfaithful favored me with light goods. the sorrowful hour / that is
to say the death had almoost dreynt mine ^eed. But now for fortune clowdy has
changed her de^^yuable chere to meward / mine vnpitouse life draws a long
vnagreable dwellinges / O ye my friends what or w^erto auaunted ye me to lene
welefull / For he that has ^^llen, stood in no steadfast degree

Hec dum mecum tacitus ipse reputarem querimoniaque lacrimabilem stili officio
signarem. asstitisse michi supra verticem visa est. mulier reuereudi ad modum
vultus. oculis ardentibus. et vltra coe^m etc
IN the mean while that I still recorded these things with my self / and
merkyd my wepely conpleynte with office ^f poyntel. I saw standing abouen the
heyght of my head a woman^ of full great reverence by semblaunte / her eyes
brennyng and clear seeing abouen the comune might of men with a lifly color /
and with such vigor and strength that it ne might not be empted. Al were it
so that she was full of great age. that men ne would not trowen. in no manner
that she were of our elde / The stature of her was of a doubt^us Judgment / for
sometime she constreyned and sh^onke her self in the com^une mesure of men / and
sometime it seemed that she touched the heaven with the height of her head. and
when she heef her head higher she perced the self heaven / so that the sight of
men loking was in ydel / her clothes were maked of right delye thredes and
subtle craft of perdurable matiere. The which clothes she had wouen with her
own hands as I knew well after by her self declaring and showing to me the
beauty. the which clothes a d^rkenes of a ^orleten and despised elde had
dusked and derked as it is wont to derke by smoked images / In the netherest
he^me o^ bordour of these clothes men red ywouen therein a grekish / A that
signefieth the life ac^yf / and above that letter in the hiest bordour a
grekish.C. that signefieth the life co^templatif. and b^twen^ these two letters
there were seen degrees nobly wrought in manner of ladders. by which degrees men
might climben from the netherest lettre to the vpperest / Natheles hands of
som^e men hadden kerue that clothe by vyolence or by strength. And euerich man
of hem hadd borne aweye such pieces as he might geten. And forsothe this
forsaide woman bare small books in her ^ighte hand. And in her lift hand she
bare a ceptre / And when she saw this se poetical muses approchyng about my
bed / And enditing words to my wepynges / she was a litill amoeued and glowed
with cruel eyes. Who quod she has suffered approchen to this seek man^ these
comyne strompettis / of which is the place that men callen Theater / the
which only ne aswagen not his sorrows with remedi^s. But they would feden^ and
nourisshe him with sweet venym / Forsothe that been thoo that with thorns and
prykkinges of talentes or affections. which that been no thing fructuous nor
profitable. Destroyen^ the corn plenteous of fruytes of reason. For they
holden hertes of men in usage. but they ne deliver no folk fro maladye But if
the muses had withdrawen^ fro me with your flateryes any an vncomyng and
vnprouffitable man as ben wont to find comynly among the people. I would well
suffer the less grievously / For why in such an vnprouffitable man / mine
ententes were no thing endamaged / But ye withdrawen^ fro me this man^ that
has been nourisshed in my studies or scoles of eliaticis and of Achademcis in
great / But goth now rather away ye mermayden^ which that been sweet til it be
at the last / and suffrith this man^ to be cured and heled by my muses. that
is to say by my notefull sciencis. And thus this c^mpanye of muses yblamed
casten wrothly the there doowneward to the erth^. and showing by redenes her
shame they passeden soroufully the thresshwold / And I of whom the sight
plou^ged in teeris was derkid so. that I ne might not know what that woman was
of so imperial auctorite / I wax al abashed and stonyed / and cast my sight
down to the earth And began still for tabide what she would done afterward
Then^e come she nere and set her down upon the vtterest corner of my bed /
and she beholding my chere that was cast to the earth. heavy and grievous of
weeping / compleyned with these words that I shall seyn the perturbacion of my
thought

Heu quam precipiti mersa profundo Men's habet and propria luce relicta Tendit
ad extremas ire tenebras Terrenis quo^iens flatibus acta Cres^it in inmensum
nor^a cura Hic quanda^ celo liber aperto etc
ALlas how the thought of this man dreynt in ou^rthrowyng depenes dulleth and
forletteth his propre clerenes / myntyng to gone into foreyne derkenesse. as
often as his anoyous besines wexeth without mesure. That is driven with worldly
wyndes. this man that whilom was free. to whom the heaven was open and known /
and was wont to gone in heavenly pathe^ / and saw the lightness of the read
son^^ And beheld the sterres of the cold moan. and which sterre in heuen^
uses wandering. recourses yflytte by diuce speris Thi^ man oucomer had
comphended all this thing by no^bre of acompting in Astronomye / And over this
he was wont to seken the causes. whens the sownyng wyndes moeuen and besien the
smothe water of the sea. And what spyrite tourneth the stable heaven. And why
the sterre rises out of the read Eest to fallen in the westren wawes And what
attempreth the lusty hours of the first somer season. And hightith and
apparailleth the earth with rosy flowers / And who makes the plenteous
Autumpne in full years fleten with heavy grapes / and eke this man was wont to
tell the diuerce causes of nature that were hid Allas how lightly is empted
the light of his thought. and his nekke is pressid with heavy cheynes / And
berith his chere inclined a down for the great weight / and is constreyned to
loken^ on the foul earth

Sed magis medicine inquit tempus est quam querele. Tum vero totis in me
intenta luminibus. Tu ne es ait qui nostro quondam lacte nutritus nostris
educatus alimentis animi inuirilis robur euaseras. etc
But time is now of medicine quod she more than complaynt. Forsothe then she
entendyng to meward with all the loking of her eyes said / Art not thou he quoth
she that whilom I nourisshed with my milk and fostred with my metes were
escaped and comen to the courage of a parfaite man. Certes I yafe the such
armures That if thou thy self ne had first cast hem away They sholden
have defended the in sikernes that may not be ouercomen. Know thou me not.
why art thou stylle is it for shame or for astonyeng / it were me lever it
were for shame. But it seems me that astonyeng has oppress^d the. and when
she saw me not only stille. but rather without office of tongue and al dombe /
She leyde her hand softly upon my breast. and said / here is no peril quoth she.
he is fallen into a litarge which that is a comyne sekenes to hertes that been
deceived / he has a litel foryeten him self / But certes he shall lightly
remembren him self if so be that he has known me or now. And that he may
done so / ^ will wype his ^yen a litil that be derked by the cloud of mortal
things. These words said she / And with the lap of her garnement yplited in
a frounce she dried mine eyes that weren full of the wawes of my wepynges.

Tunc (...) discussa liquerunt nocte tenebre Lum^nibusque prior redit vigor Ut
cum precipiti glomerantur sidera choro Nimbosisque polus st^tit ymbribus Sol
latet ac non dum celo vementibus astris etc
Thus when that night was discussed away / derkenes forlete me. And to mine
eyes repaired again her first strength. And right as by ensample. as the son
is hid when the sterres ben couerd with cl^udes by a swift wind that hight
Chorus / And the firmament stant derked by wete plungy clouds. And that the
sterres not appieren upon the heuene. so that the night seems spradd upon the
earth. If then the wind that hight boreas ysent out of the cave of the
country of Trace / beteth this night That is to seyne chaseth it aweye / And
discouerith the closed day / Then shyneth phoebus yshaken with sodeyne light
and smyteth with his beams in meruayling eyes

Haut aliter triscicie nebulis dissolutis. ^^usi celum et ad cognoscendum
me^dicantis faciem mentem recepi Itaque vbi in eam deduxi oculos. intuitumque
defixi. Respicio nutricem meam cuius ab adolescencia etc
Right so and none other wise / the cl^udes of sorrow dissolved and done away
/ I took heuene and received mind to known the face of my phis^cien. So that
I set mine eyes upon her and fastened my lokyng / I beheld my noryce
philosophy in whose house I hadd conuersed fro my yougth. and I said thus / O
thou maistresse of all virtues descended from the sovereign s^te / why art
thou comen into this solitary place of mine exile / Art thou comen for thou
art maad culpable with me of ^^lse blames. O quod she my norie should I forsake
the now. and should I not parten with the by comyne travail the charge that
thou have suffr^d for envy of my name. Certes hit were not leefful ne fitting
to philosophy to leten without company the way of him that is Innocent.
should I then^e redoubte my blame / and agrise as thaugh there were befallen a
new thing / For trowest thou that Philosophy be now alder first assaylled
in perils by folk of wicked manner have I not striuen with full great strife
in old time before the aage of my Plato / against the folehardynesse of folly.
And eke the same plato living / his master Socrates deserved victory of
vnrightful death in my presence The heritaige of the which Socrates / the
heritaige is to sayn the doctrine of the which Socrates in his opynyon^ of
felicite / that I cl^pe welefulnes. when that the peuple of Epycuriens and
Stoiciens and many other enforsed them to go rauisshe. every man for his part
that is to seyn That eueriche of hem would drawn to the defense of his opinion
the words of Socrates. They as in party of their pray to drowen me ^^y^^g
and debating there against And coruen and renten my clothes that I hadd wonnen
with mine own hands. And with tho clothes that they hadd araced out of my
cloth^s they w^nten away. wenyng that I had gone ^^th him eu^ridele. In
which Epicuriens and Stoici^ns for as much as there seemed som^e traces and
steps of my hab^te / The folly of wenyng the ^picuriens and Stoiciens my
famyli^^s / perue^ted som^e th^urgh therrour of the wi^ked multitude of hem /
This i^ to s^yn ^^r they s^m^d phil^s^ph^rs. they w^ren po^rs^^wed to the ^^^th
and slain / So if thou ^^st not known thexising of Anaxagoras ne then
poysenyng of Socrates / Ne the torments of ^e^o for they weren strangers. yet
myghtest thou have known / the sen^ctyens. the Camos / and the Soranos / Of
which folk the renommee is neither ever old ne vnsolemp^^ The which men no
thing ellis ne brought to the death But only for they were informed of my
manners / And semeden most unlike to the s^udyes of wicked folk And forthy
thou ought not to wondren though that I in the by^ter see be driven with
tempests blowyng about. In the which this is my most pourpoose. That is to
seyne to displesen wicked men. Of which shrewes al be the host never so
great. it is to despise. for hit is not governed with no leder of reason / But
it is rauisshed only by fleting error folily and lightly. and if they sometime
make an hooste against us / Assail us as stren^ger / Our leder draws to gedir
his richesses into his tour And they ben ententif about sarpleris or sachellis
unprofitable for to taken. But we that been high abouen siker from all tumulte
and wood noise. warnestored and enclosed in such a palace. whider as that
clatering or anoyeng folly may not atteyne / we scorn such raueners and
henters of foulest things

Quisquis composito serenus euo Fatum sub pedibus agit superbum Fortunamque
tuens vtramque r^ctus Inuictum potuit tenere vultum etc
WHo so it be that clear of virtue sad and well ordynat of living that has put
underfoot the proud wierdes / and looks upright upon either fortune he may
holden his chere vndescomfited / The rages ne the manaces of the sea co^moeuyng
and chasing unware hete from the bottom^e / ne shall not m^oue that man^. ne the
unstable montayne that hight Vesenus that writheth out through his broken
chymeneyes smokyng fyres. Ne the wey of thonder leyte. that is wont to smyten
high toures ne shall not moeue that man^ / where to then wretches dreed ye
tyrauntes that been wood and felonnous with any strength. Hoop^ after nothing
Ne dread thou not. And so shallest thou disarmen the Ire of thilk vnmyghty
tyran^t / but who that quaking deedeth or desires thing that is not stable of
his right. that man that so does / has cast away his shield / and is remoeued
fro his place. and enlaseth him in the cheyne. with the which he may be drawen^

Sentis ne inquit hec atque animo illabu^tur. quid fles Quid lacrimas manas. si

FElistow quod she these things. and entren^ they ought in thy courage / art
thou like an ass to the harp. why wepestow why spillistow teeris. if thou
abidest after help of thy leche. the behooves discou thy wound. tho I had
gaderid strength in my courage ansuerde and said / And needs it quod I of
rehercing or of amonico^n. And shewith it not enough by him self the sharpenes
that wexeth wode against me. Ne moeueth it not the to see the face or the manner
of this place. Is this the librarye that thou had chosen for a right
certain siege to the in myn^ house / there as thou disputest often with me. of
the science of things / touching dyuinite and touching ma^kinde / was then
myn^ habit such as hit is now. was my face or chere such as is now / when I
sought with the secrets of nature / when thou enformedest my manners and the
reason^ of al my life to thensample of the order of leuene. Is not this the
guerdon^ that I refer to the / to whom I have be obeysan^te. Certes thou
enformedest by the mouth of plato this sentence / that is to seyn^. that comyn^
things or comynaltees weren blisfull / If they that had studied all fully to
wisdom gouerneden thilke things Or else if it so befell that the governors of
comynaltees studieden to get wysedom / thou saidest eke by the mouth of the
said plato that it was a necessary cause / wise men^ to taken and desiren the
gouernan^ce of comyne things. for that the gouernements of citees yleft in the
hands of felonous tourmentours / cytezeins ne sholden not bringen in
pestilence and distruccion to good folk. And therefore I following thilke
auctours desired to put forth in execucion and in act of comyne administracion
thilk things that I had lernid of the among my secree restingwhiles / thou and
god that put in the thoughts of wise folk / ben knowing with me. that nothing
ne brought me to maistrye or dignite / but the comyne study of all goodness.
And thereof comes it that between wicked folk and me have been grievous
discordes That ne mighten not be relessed by prayers. for this liberte has the
fredom^e of conscience / that the wrath of more mighty folk has always ben
despised of me for sauaco^n of right. How often have I resisted and withstand
that man that hight Coniugast / that made alwey thassautes against the prosper
fortunes of pour feeble folk. How often eke have I put of / or cast out him
Trigwille provost of the kings house. both of the wroonges that he hadd
begone to doon^. And eke fully performed / How often have I covered and
defended by the auctorite of me put against parills. That is to seyne / put
mine Auctorite in peril For the wretchid pour folk. that the couetise of
strangers unpunished tourmenteden allewaye with myseases and greuan^ces out
of nombre / Never man^ yet drowe me fro right to wrong. when I saw the
fortunes and the richesses of the peuple of the prouynces ben harmed and
amenused either by preuy rauynes or by common trybutes or cariages. as sorry was
I / as they that suffreden the harm Gloss When that Theodorik King of Goths
in a deed year hadd his garners full of corn / and com^anded that no man^
should bye no corn / till his corn were sold And at a grievous dear price /
Boece withstode that ordenance and overcame hit / Knowing all this the king
Theodoryk him self / Coempcion is to say comyne achate or byeng to gyder.
that were establisshed upon the people by such a manner Imposicion^ / As who so
boughte a busshell corn. he must yeuen the king the fyfthe part Textus

When hit was in the sour hongry time / there was establissed grievous and
vnprouffitable coempcion^ that men seen^ well. hit should greetly tormenten and
endamagen all ^he prouynce of Campayne. I took striff ayeenst the Proudste of
the pretorie for the comyne prouffite. And the knowing of hit / I overcome hit
/ so that the coempcion^ was not axed ne took effect Paulyne a counseyllour
of Rome. the riches of the which Paulyne. the hou^des of the palace. That is
to say / thofficers wolden^ have deuour^d by hope and couetise. Yet drowe I
out of the Iowes of him that gapeden. And for as much as the pain of
thaccusacion^ aiugged biforne ne should not suddenly henten ne punysshen
wrongfully Albyn a counceyllour of Rome. I put me against the hates and
Indignacions of thaccusour Cipryan / Is it not then^e enough syn^ that I have
purchaced great discordes against my self. But I ought be more assured against
other folk / that for the love of rightwisnes I never reserved no thing to my
self / to hemward of the kings halle / by which I were the more siker. But
through thoo same accusours accusing / I am condemned. Of the nombre of which
accusours one basiliuz that whilome was chaced out of the kings service. Is
now compellyd in accusyng of my name. For need of foreyn money / Also Opilion
and Gaudencius han accused me. Al be hit so that the Justice regal hadd
whilome demed them both to goon^ in to exyle for her trecheryes and frawdes
with out nombre. To which Iuggement they nolden not obey / but defended hem
by the sikernesse of holy hows^s. That is to seyne / fledden in to seyntewarye
/ And then when this was apperceyued by the king / he commanded but if they
voyded the Cite of rauenne by certain day ass^gned / that men should marken
him on the forhede with an hoote yren / and chas^n hem out of the town / Now
what thing seems / might be likened to this cruelte. For certes this same
day was received the accusing of my name by thilke same accusours / What may
be said hereto. has my study and my connyng deserved thus. or ellis the
foresaid dampnacion of me maad hem rightful accusours or no. was not fortune
ashamed of this / Certes all hadd not fortune ben^ ashamed that Innocence was
accused. yet ought she han had shame of the filth of mine accusours. but axe
thou in som^e of what gylte I am accused / Men seyn^ that I would sauen the
company of the Senators. And desire thou to heren in what manner I am
accused that I should han distourbed thaccusour to beren^ lettres / by which he
should have made the senators gilty against the kings royal mageste / O
maistresse what demest thou of this / shall I forsake this blame. that I ne be
no shame to the / Certes I have would it. that is to say the sauacion of the
senate I ne shall neu let to wilne it / And that I confess and am a know. but
thentente of thaccusour to ben distourbed shall cesse. Shall I clep^ that a
felonye or a sin that I have desired the sauacion of the order of the senate
/ And certes hadd thilke same senate done through her decretes and her
Iugementis as though it were a sin and a felonye. that is to wilne the
s^uacion of them. But folly that lies alwey to him self may not change the
merit of things / Ne I trow not by the Judgment of socrates that it were
leefful to me to hide the s^th ne assente to ^^synges / but certes how so ^uer
hit be of this I put it to gessyn or prisen of the Judgment of the and of wise
folk. of which thing all th^rdenance and the s^th. for as much as folk that
been to comen after our days shall known it / I have put hit in scripture and
in remembran^ce / For touching the letters falsely made / by which letters I
am accused to han h^p^d the fredom^e of rome / what apperteyneth me to speken
thereof. Of which letters the fraud had been shewde apertely if I had had
liberte for to have used and ben at confession of mine accusours / The which
thing in all needs h^th great strength. For what other fredem may men hopen.
certes I would that som^e other fredome might be hoped. I would then^e have
answered by the words of a man that hight Camus. for when he was accused of
gayus Caesar germeynes sone. that he was knowing and consentyng of a coniuracion
y made against him / This Camus ansuerde thus if I had wist it / thou had
not wist it / In which thing sorrow has not so dulled my wit that I pleyne
only that shrewd folk apparaillen felonyes against virtue. But I wondre greatly
how that they may perform things that they have hoped for to done. f^r why ne
will ne shrewdnes that comes perauenture of our defaute But it is like a
monstre and a meruaille how that in the present sight of god may been achieued
and performed such things. as every felenous man has conceived in his
thought against Innocents / For which thing one of thy famyliers not
unskillfully axed thus. If god is. whens comen wicked things / But al had it
been leeffull that felonous folk / that now desiren the blood and the deeth of
all good men. And eke of the senate han wilned to goon destroyen me whom they
have seyn^ always bataillen and defenden good men and eke all the senate that
had not deserved of the faders / that is to seyn of the senators that they
sholden will my destruction. Thou remembrest well as I guess. that when I would
done or seyn any thing. thou thy self always present ruledest me. At cite of
verone when that the king gredy of comyn^ slaughter / cast him to transporten
upon all the order of the senate the gilte of his rial mageste. of the which
gilte that Albyn was accused. with how great sikernes of peril to me /
defended I all the senate. thou wotest well that I say soth. Ne I ne auaunted
me never in praising of my self For always when any wight receives precious
renom^e^ In auaunting of him self or his werkis / he amenuseth the se^r^e of
his conscience / but now thou may well seen to what end I am comen. for mine
Innocence I receive pain of falls felonnye for gwerdon of verey virtue. and
what opene confession of felonnye had ever Iugges so a^^rdant in cruelte. that
is to seyne as mine ^^cusing has. that either error of man^es wit / or else
condition of fortune. that is uncertain to al mortal folk ne submitted some of
hem. that is to seye that it ne inclined some judge to han pite or compassion /
for all though I had been accused that I would b^en^e holy houses and strangle
prestes with wicked sword. or that I had greythed death to al good men /
algates the sentence should have punysshed me p^sent confess^d or conuicte. but
now I am remo^ued from the cite of rome almost. v. C. M. paa^ I am without
defense dampened to proscripcion and to death / for the studies and bou^tees that
I have done to the senate / but / o well ben they worthy of merit / as who
seith / nay / there might yet never none of hem be conuicte of such a blame as
mine is. Of which trespaas mine accusours said full well the dignite / for they
would d^rk^n it with meddling of some felonye. They baren me on hand and said
that I had polute and defouled my conscience with sacrilege for couetyse of
dygnite / And certes thou thy self that art planted in me. chacedest out of
the siege of my courage al couetise of mortal thinge^ / Ne sacrelege ne had no
leave to have a place in me before thyn eyes / for thou droppedest every day in
myncere^ and in my thought thilke com^andement of pictagoras. That is to seye
men shall seruen to god and not to gods / Ne it was not convenient ne none
need to taken help of the foulest spirits / I that thou have ordeigned and
set in such excellence. that thou made me like to god. And ou this the
right clean secre chamber of mine house / that is to seye my wyff. And the
company of myn^ honest friends. and my wives fader as well holy as worthy to be
/ reuerensed for his deeds / defenden me from al suspeccion of such blame. But
/ o. malice / For they that accusen me taken of the philosophy feith of so
great blame / for they trowen that I have had affinite to malefice or
enchantement / because that I am replenisshed and fulfilled with thy techinges
and informed of thy manners. and thus it suffrith not only that thy reverence ne
avail me naught / but if thou of thy frewill rather be blemisshed with mine
offenco^n / But certes to the harms that I have there betideth yet this
encresse of harm. that the gessing and the judgment of much folk ne loken
nothing to the deserts of things but only to thauenture of fortune. and
iuggen that only such things ben pourueyed of god / which that temporal
wilfulnes commands Glosa As thus. that if a wight have prosperity he is a
good man and worthy to have that prosperity. and who so has adusite. he is a
wicked man / and god has forsake him / and he is worthy to have that adusite.
This is thoppinion of some folk / and thereof comes that good gessing. first of
althing forsaked wretches / certes it greueth me to think right now in diuce
sentencis that the people seith of me. and thus much I seye that the last
charge of co^trarious fortune is this / that when any blame is leyd upon a
caytif. men wenen that he has deserved that he suffers. and I that am put
away from good men^ and despoiled of dignitees. and defowled of my name by
gessing have suffered tourmentes for my good deeds. Certes me seems / that I
see the felenous couynes of wicked men habou^den in Joy and in gladness. And
I see that every lorel shapeth him to find new frawdes for to accuse good
folk. and I see that good folk be overthrown for dread of my peril / and every
luxurious tormentour dar done all felonye unpunished and ben excited thereto
by yeftes / and Innocentis be not only dispoiled of sikernes but of defense /
And thereto me list to cryen to god in this manner

I tell the that she lives loath of this life / And keeps to the only her
gooste / and is all mate and overcome by weeping and sorrow for desire of the.
In the which thing only I mote graunten the / that thy welefulnes is
amenused. What shall I seyen eke of thy two son^es counceyllours / Of which as
of childeren of her eage there shyneth the likeness of the wit of her fader and
of her eld^ fader / And sithen the souerayn cure of all mortal folk is to
sauen her own lives / if thou know thy self / thy goods make the more
weleful. For yet ben there things dwellid to the ward that no man^ doubts
that they ne been more derworth to the than thine own life / And forthy / dry

tempest ne has not yet fallen upon the / when th^ne (...) ^leuen fast / That
neither wolle suffren the comfort of this time present. ne the hope of time
coming to passen ne to faillen. B. And I pray quoth I that fast mote they

the quoth she / if that thou anoye not or forthyn^ie not of all thy fortune / As
who seith. I have somwh^t conforted the. so that thou tempeste not the thu^
with all thy fortune / sithen thou have yet thy best things ^ But I may not
suffren thy delices that pleynest so weeping and anguissh^u^ / For that there
lacks som^e what to thy wel^fulnes / for what man is he that is so sad or of
great p^^fighte welefulnes. that ^e ne seryueth and pleyne^h on som^e halue
a^en the qual^te of his estate / For why full anguisshou^ thing is the
condition of man's goods / For either hit comes not al to gedre to a wight
or ellis it ne lasts not perpetuell / For sum man has gre^e richesse. but
he is ashamed of his vngentil lignage And som^e man^ is renomed of noblesse of
kynrede / but he is enclosed in so great anguisshe of need of things / that
him were lever that he were unknow. And sum man habou^deth both in richesse
and noblesse / but yet he bewaileth his chaste life / For he ne has no wyff.
And som^e man^ is and selily married. but he has no childeren and nourisshith
his richesses to strange folk. And som^e man^ is gladed with childeren but he
wepeth full sore for the trespaas of his sone or of his daughter / And for this
there ne accords no wight lightly to the condition of his fortune For alweye
to every man^ there is in somewhat. that unassayed. he ne wot naught / or ellis
he dredeth that he has assayed. and add this also that every welful man has
a full delicate feling / so that but if all things befallen at his own
will. he is Inpaci^nte / or is not used to have none aduersite / anon he is
thrown adoune for every litil thing / And full litil things b^n th^o that
withdrawn the som^e of the perfeccion of blissfulness ^ro hem that been most
fortunat / how many men trowest thou would demen hem self almoost in heuene. If
they might atteyne to the least party of the remenan^t of thy fortune. this
same place that thou clepest exyle / I^ countreye to hem that enhabiten here.
And for thy no thing wretched but when thou wenest hit / As who seith / thou
thy self ne no wight else nys a wretch / But when he weneth him self he is a
wretch by repntacion of his courage. and ayeinward al fortune is blisful to a
man by the agreabilite or by the egalite of him that suffers it / what man is
that that is so welful that nold change his estate / when he has lost his
patience / the swetnes of man^es welfulnes is spreint with many bitternessis
The which welefulnes al though it seem sweet and ioyefull to him that uses it
/ yet may it not been with holden that ne goth away when it will. then^e is
well seen how wretched is the blesfulnes of mortal things that neither hit
dureeth perpetuel with hem that every fortune receyuen agreably and egally. Ne
it ne deliteth not in all to hem that been anguisshous. O ye mortal folk what
seek ye then blisfulnes out of your self. which is put in your self. error
and folly confou^deth you / I shall show the shortly the point of souerayn
blisfulnes. Is there any thing to the more precious than thy lyff / thou will
answer nay. Then^e if it so be that thou art mighty over thy self / that is t^
seyn. by transquillite of thy soul. then^e have thou thing in thy power that
thou noldest never lesen / ne fortune may not byneme it the / And that thou
may know that blisfulnes ne may not stand in things that been f^rtunous and
temporell / Now understand and gader it to geder thus / if blisfulnes be the
souerayn good of nature that lives by reason Ne thilke thing is not souerayn
good that may be taken away in any wise / for more worthy thing is and more
dygne thilke thing that may not be taken away / Then^e shew^t^ it well that the
unstableness of fortune may not atte^ne to receive ^^rey blisfulnes / And yet
more over what man that this tombling welefunles ledeth / either he wot that
it is chaungeable or else he wot it not / And if he wot hit not / what blisful
fortune may there been in the bly^d^nes of Ignorance. And if he wot that it is
chau^geable. he mo^e all way ben a dradd that he ne lose that thing that he ne
doubts not but that he may lesen hit As who seith / he mote always be agaste
lest he lose that he woot well he may lose it. For which the continuell dread
that he has ne suffers him not to be weleful. or else if he lose it. he weneth
to be despised and forleten / Certes eke that is a full l^til good that is born^
with even heart when it is lost / That is to seyne that men do no more force of
the lost than of the having / And for as much as thou thy self art he to whom
it has be showed and preuyd by full many demonstracions / as I wot well that
the souls of men ne mowen not deyen in no wise / And eke syn hit is clear and
certain that fortunouse welefulnes ends by the death of the body. It may not
be doubted that if death may take away blisfulnes / that all the kind of mortal
thing ne descends into wretchedness by the end of death / and sithen we know
well that many a man has sought the fruit of blisfulnes not only with suffering
of death. but eke with ^uffring of peynes and tourmentes. How might then this
present life make men blisful. sin that thilk self life ended. it ne makes
folk no wretches

seek to drive away need with habondance of things but certes it torneth you
al into the contrary. for why certes it needs of full many helpinges to kepen

such is the condition of all mankind. That only what it has knowing of it

the knowing of it self / then is it brought bynethe all beestis / For why
all other living beestis han of kind to know not him self. But whan^ men

Quid autem de dignitatibus potenciaque disseram qs woe vere dignitatis ac

B^t what shall I say of dignitees and powers / the which ye men that neither
known verry dignite ne very power areisen hem as high as the heaven the which
dignitees and powers. if they comen to any ^i^kid man. they don as great
domages and destruccions as does the flambe of the mo^tayne ethna. when the
flambe waloweth up. ne no deluuy^ ne does so cruel harms / certes ye remember
well as I trow that thilk dignite that men clepe the imperie of cou^ceilours the
which whilom was begyn^yng of fredom / your elders coueyted to have don away
that dignite for the pride of the counceyllours. And right for that same your
elders by fore that time had done away out of the Cite of rome the kings
name. that is to seyn they nolde have no longer no king / But now if so be that
dignitees and powers been youen to good men^. the which thing is full seeld
what agreeable things is there in tho dignitees and powers but only the goodness
of folk that vsen hem / And therefore is it thus that honor comes not to
virtue bicausi of dignite / And a yenward honor comes to dignite for cause of
virtue. But which is thilke your derworth power that is so clear and so
requirable / O ye erthly beestis considere ye not over which thing that hit
seems that ye han power / Now if thou saw a mowse among other mise that
chalanged to him selfward right and power over al other myse How great scorn
would thou have of it Glosa So fares it by men / the body has power over
the body / for if thou look well upon the body of a wight what thing shall thou
find more freel. than is mankind / the which men full often be slain by biting
of flies / or ellis with entering or crepyng worms into the pryuitees of man^es
body. but where shall men finden any man that may excercen or hau^ten any right
upon an other man but only on his body. or ellis upon things that been lower
than the body. the which I clepe fortunous possessions. May thou have ever
any commandment over a free courage / May thou remeeue fro thestate of his
propre rest a thought that is cliuyng to geder in him self by steadfast
reason. As whylome a Tyrant wened to confound a free man^ of courayge and he
wend to constreyne him by tourmentes to maken him discoueren and accusen folk
that wisten of a coniuracion. which I clepe a confedrecie that was cast
against this tyrau^te / but this freman bote of his own tongue and cast hit in
the vysage of thilke wood tyrau^t. So that the tourmentes that this wood
tyrau^t wend to han made matiere of cruelte / this wise man^ mad it matiere of
virtue. But what thing is hit that a man^ may do to an other man^ / that he
ne may receyuen the same thing of other folk in him self. or thus / what may
a man done to folk That folk ne may done to him the same / I have herd told
of Busirides that was wont to sleen his gestes. that herburghden in his house
/ And he was slain him self by Hercules that was his geste. regusus hadd
taken in bataille many men of Aufryke and cast hem into fetteres But sone
after he must yeuen his ^andes to be bound with the cheynes of hem that he
hadd whilome ouercomen. wenest thou then that he be mighty that has power
to done a thing / that other ne may done in him that ^e has in other / And
yet more over if so were that these dignytees or powers hadden any propre or
nature^l goodne^ in hem self / never nolde they comen to shrewes / for
contrarious things ne ben wont to been yfelaushipped to gedirs Nature
refuses that contrarious things been Joined. And so as I am in certain that
wicked folk han dignytees often time / Then^e shows hit well that dygnitees
and powers ne been not good of her own kind / syn that they suffren hem self
to cleuen or Ioynen hem self to shrewes / and certain the same thing may I
most dignelich iuggen and seyn^ of all the yeftes of fortune that most
plenteously comen^ to shrewes / of which yeftes I trow it ought be considered
that noman doubted that he is strong in whom he sees strength. and in whom
swiftines is. soth it is that he is swift. Also music makes musiciens. and
phisike makes phisiciens / and rethorike rethoriens. for why the nature of
every thing makes his properte. ne it is not entremedled with theffecte of
contrarious things. but certes richesse may not restreyne avarice vnstau^ched
/ Ne power ne makes not aman mighty over him self / which that vicious lusts
holden distreyned with chains that ne mowen not be vnbou^den / and dignitees
that be yeuen to shrewde folk / not only ne makes hem not digne. but shows
rather al openly that they ben unworthy and indigne / and it is thus / for
certes ye han joy to clepe things with falls names that beren hem in all the
cou^tray / the which names ben full often reproved by theffecte of the same
things. so that these ilke richesses ne oughten not by right to be cleped
richesses. ne such power ne ought not to be cleped power. ne such dignite ne
ought not to be cleped dignite. and at last I may conclude the same thing of all the yeftes of fortune In which there nys nothing to be desired ne that has in
him self naturel bou^te / as it is well y seen. for neither they ioynen hem /
not always to good men. ne maken hem all way good to whom they ben joined

thilke glory / certain thing is as thou have learned by the demonstracion of

men would Iuggen in all that ne held ne space. Of the which litell region of
this world The fourth part of the earth is inhabited with living beestis

eke the fame of ^ytees man not s^re^c^^n. At last certes in the time of

thilke noble renommee shall be restreyned with in the bounds of tho manner

THe fastened she a lit^l the sight of her eyes. And she withdrewe her right as
it were into the streyte sete of her thought. And biganne to speak right thus.
All the a^res quoth she of mortal folk which that trauailen^ him in many manner
studies goon certes by diuce wey^s. But natheles they enforcen hem all to comen
only to the end of blisfulnes / And blisfulnes is such a good That who so has
gotten it. he ne may over that thing more desire. And this thing forsothe is
so souerayn good that hit conteyneth in him self all manner of goods. to the
which good if there failled any thing. it might not been souerayn good / For
then^e were there som^e good our of this souerayn good that might be desired.
Now is it clear and certain that blisfulnes is a parfayte estate by the
congregation of all goods. the which blisfulnes as I have said all mortal
folk enforcen hem to get by diuerce weyes. For why the couetise of every good
is naturelly planted in the hertes of men / But the myswandryng error /
mysledeth hem into false goods / Of the which men some of hem wenen that
souerayn good be to lyuen^ without need of any thing. And other men demen that
souerayn good be right digne of reverence / and enforcen hem to be reuerencid
among her neighbors by the honors that they have gotten. And som^e folk there
been that holden that right hye power be sovereign good / and enforcen hem for
to reygnen^. or else to Ioynen hem to hem that reygnen. and it seems to other
folk that noblesse of renomme be the souerayn good. and hasten hem to geten^
hem glorious name by the arts of war or of peace. and many folk mesuren and
gessen that sovereign good be Joy and gladness And wenen that it be right
blisful thing to plungen in voluptuous delites. And there been some folk that
entrechangen the causes and the ends of these foresaid goods And they that
desiren richesses to have power and delites or ellis they desire power for to
have money / or for cause of renomme. In these things and such other is
turned all thentencion of desiringes and works of men as thus. Noblesse and
favor of peuple which that yeueth to al men^ as it seems hem a manner
clerenes of reno^me. and wyff and children^ that men desiren^ for cause of
delight and merines. But forsothe friends ne shollen^ not be rekenyd among the
goods of fortune. but of virtue. For it is a full holy manner thing / Al these
other things forsooth be taken for cause of power or ellis for cause of delight.
Certes now am I ready to referren the goods of the body to th^se forsaide
things abouen / For it seems that strength and gretenes of body yeuen power
and worthiness. and that beauty and swiftenes yeu^n glory and reno^me. and
health of body seems to yeuen delight / In all these things hit seems only
that blisfulnes is desired / For why thilke thing that every man^ des^reth most
over all things. he demeth that it be souerayn good. But I have diffined that
blisfulnes is sovereign good / For which every wight demeth that thilke astate
that he des^reth over al things. that it be blisfulnes. now have thou th^n^e
b^^^^n^ th^^ eyes almost all the pourpos^d form of the (...) of mankind / That
is to s^^ne richesse. h^n^ur^. po^^^r gl^rie and de^^^es. the which del^te
only consi^^r^d h^ ^picurius. and iugg^d and establissh^d that delight is the
s^u^ra^ne good / For as much as all other things as him th^ught b^reft away
Joy and mirth from the h^rte but I return again to the studies of men^ of
which men the courage. ^lway reherceth and seeks the souerain good Al ^e it so

dro^kenman^ note naught by which path ^e may return home to his ^^us. s^meth
it then that fol^ forleyen and erren to ^nforcen hem to have need of nothing
Certes there is none other thing that may somoch performen blisf^lnes, ^s an
estate plente^us of al goods that ne has need of none ot^^^ thing. but that
is suffisan^t of him self unto him self. and folien such folk then^e that
wenen that thilke thing that is right good / that it is eke right worthy of
honor and of reverence / Certes nay. for that thing nys neither foul ne
worthy to be despised. that well nygh al thentencion of mortal folk trauaillen

For it nys not to wene that thilke thing that is most worthy of all things

despised. certes there may noman^ forsake / that al thing that is right
exellent and noble that it ne seems be right clear and renomed. For certes it
needs not to seye that blisfulnes be anguisshous ne drery ne subget to

they neither have honger ne thurst / These rich men may feel no cold on their

this wise may need ben^ comforted by richesse. but certes need ne may not al

be fulfilled / I hold me still and tell not how that litil thing suffiseth to

Sed dignitates honorabilem reuerendumque cui prouenerint reddunt. Nam uis ea

han they not so great strength that they may putten virtue in hertes of folks
that vsen the lordship of hem. or else may they done away the vices / Certes
they be not wont to done away wickedness / but they be wont rather to show
wickedness. and th^rof comes it that I have right great disdayn^ that dignitees
ben yeuen to wicked m^n^. For which thing Catullus clep^d a consul of rome
that hight Nomyus / postome of bo^^he. as who s^ith he cleped him a
congregation of vices in his breast. as a postome is full of corrupcion / al
were Nomyus set in a chayer of dignite / Se^stow not th^nne h^w great
vilonyes dignit^es done to wicked men certes unworthiness of wicked men^ should
be the l^ss^ s^^n if they nere renomed of none honors. Certes then thy self
ne might not be brought with as many p^rils as thou might suffer that
thou woldes^ bear the magistrate with d^^^rate^ that is to seyn^ that for peril
that might befalle the b^ offense of the King theodryk. thou noldest not b^^
felawe in governance with decorate when thou saw t^^t he had wicked courage of
a lichorouse shrewe and of an accusour Ne I may not for such honors iuggen
hem worthy of reverence that I deem and hold unworthy to have thilk same
honors. now if thou saw aman^ that were fulfild of wisdom / certain thou ne
might not deem that he were unworthy to the honor or else to the wisdom of
which he is fulfilled B. no quoth I / P / certes quoth she dignitees apperteynen
properly to virtue / and virtue transporteth dignite anon to thilke man^ to
which she her self is conjoined. and for asmoche as honors of people ne may
not make folk digne of honor It is well seen clerly that they ne have no propre
beaulte of dignite. and yet men oughten take more head in this. for if a wighte
be in somoche the more outcast that he is despised of most folk / so as dignite
ne may not maken shrewes worthy of no reverence / then^e makes dignite shrewes
/ rather despised than preysed. the which shrewes dignite shows to much
folk / and forsooth not unpunished / that is to s^yne that shrewes reuengen hem
ayeinward upon dignitee^ / for they yelden again to dignitees as great guerdons
/ when they bispotten and defoulen dignitees with her vilonye. and for asmoche
as thou now know that thilk verey reverence ne may not comen by these
shadowy transitory dignitees / understand now thus. that if a man^ had used
and had many manner dignitees of consules and were perauenture comen among
stran^ge nations / should thilk honor maken him worshipful and redoubted of
stran^ge folk / certes if that honor of people were a naturel yefte to
dignitees it ne might never cessen nowher among no manner folk to done his
office. right as a fire in every country ne stinteth not to enchaufen and maken
hot / But for as much as for to ben honorable or reverent ne comes not to
folk of her propre strength of nature but only of the false opinion of folk.
That is to seyne that wenen that dignitees maken folk digne of honors / Anon
therefore when they comen there as folk ne known not thilke dignitees her
honors vanisshen aweye and that anon / But that is among strange folk
maistow seyn^. ne among hem there they were borne ne dured not thilke
dignitees alwey. Certes the dignite of the prouostrye of rome was whilom a
great power / now is it nothing but an idle name. and the rent of the
senatorie a greet charge / And if a wight whilome had thoffice to taken head to
the vitailles of the people. as of corn and of other things he was holden
among hem great. But what thing is more now outcast that thilke prouostrie.
as I have seyde a litil here biforn^ that thilke thing that has no propre
beauty of him self receives sometime price and shynyng / and sometime leseth it
by thoppinion of vsauntes. Now if that dignitees than ne mow not make folk
digne of reverence. and if that dignitees wexe foul of her will by the filthe
of shrewes. And if dignytees lesen her shynyng by chau^gyng of times / and if
they wexen foul by estimacion of people / what is hit that they han in him
self of beauty that ought to be d^sired / As who seyth ^ none / then^e ne

hit so that the royaumes of ma^kinde stretchen broad / yet mote there need been
much folk over which that every king ne has no lordship ne commandment /
And certes upon thilke side that power failleth which that makes folk
blisfull. right on that same side. none power enters underneath that makes
hem wretches / In this manner then mote Kings han more portion of
wretchedness thanne of welefulnesse. A tyran^t that was king of sesille that
had assayed the paril of his astate showed by simylitude the dredes of royaumes
by gastnes of a sword that henge over the heed of his famylier / what thing
is then^e this power that may not done away the bytinges of besines. ne eschew
the prickis of dread And certes yet wolden they liuen in sikernesse. but they
may not / And yet they glorifien hem in her power / hold thou then^e that
thilk man^ be mighty that thou see that he would done that he may not done.
And holdestow him a mighty man^ that has enuironned his sides with men^ of
arms or with sergeantes. And dread more hem that he makith aghast than they
dread him / And that is put in the ^andes of his servants for he should seem
mighty / But of famyliers or seruan^tes of kings. why should I tell the any.
syn that I my self have showed the that royames hem self b^ne full of f^blenes
/ The which famyliers c^rtes the royal power of kings in hole estate and in

renounced their power. Of which two Seneke enforced hem to yeuen to Nero al
his richesses. and also to have goon^ in to solitary exyle. But when the great
wighte. That is to seye of lords power or of fortune draws hem that shall
fall / neither of him might done that he would. That thing is then^e thilk
power that though men hane hit / yet they been agaste And when thou would
have it thou nart not siker. and if thou would forleten it thou may not
eschewen it / but whether such men be friends at need as ben cou^ceilled by
fortune / and not by virtue / Certes such folk as weleful fortune makes
friends / contrarious fortune makes hem enemies. and what pestilence is more
mighty for to anoye a wight than a famylier enemy

wise folk that mesuren her good not by rumor of the people. but by the
sothfastnes of conscience. and if it seem a fair thing a man^ to han enc^^ced

it ne be sprad and encreaced. but as I said a litil here byforn^ / that syn
there mote be needs many folk to which (...) the reno^me of a man ne may not

gentilnesse be referred to renomme and clerenes of lignage / then^e is g^ntil

deserts of au^cetries. and if preysing makes gentilnesse / then moten they
needs be gentil that been praised For which thing it follows that if thou ne
have no gentilesse of thy self that is to seyne price that comes of thy
deserte foreyne gentilnes ne makes the not gentil / But certes if there be any
good in gentilnes. I trow it be a lonly this. that it seems that a manner

For asmoch then^e as thou have seen which is the form of good / that nys
not perfyt / and the form of good which that is perfyt. now trow I that it
were good to show in what this perfeccion of blisfulnes is set / and in this
thing I trow that we shall first enquere for to weten if that any such manner
good as thilke good as thou haste diffinisshed a litill here biforne. That is
to seyne souerayn good may be found in the nature of things / For that
vaynt ymaginacion^ of thought ne deceive us not and putt us out of the
sothfastnes of thilke thing that is submytted to us. But it may not be denied
that thilk ne is / and that is right as a well of all goods. For all thing
that is clep^d inparfite is proved inparfite by the amenusing of perfeccion of
thing that is parfite / And here of comes it that in every thing ge^eral if
that men seen any thing that is inparfite. Certes in thilke thing general
there mote be som^e thing that is parfite / For if so be that perfeccion is
done away / men may not think ne say from whens thilke thing is that is
cleped inparfite / for the nature ne took not her beg^nnyn^ of things amenused
and inparfite / but hit proceeds of things. that been all ^ooll absolute And
d^scend^th so down in to the vttr^s^ thing^s and in to things empty and with
out fruit / But as I have showed a litill here biforne that if that there be a
^lisfulnes that be frele and vein and inpfite th^re may no man doubt that
there nys som^e blisfulnes that there is sad steadfast and parfite / B. This is
concluded quoth I fermely and sothfastly. P. But considere also quoth she in whom
this blisfulnes inhabiteth / The com^une accord and conceyte of the courage of
men proves and grau^teth that god pr^^ce of all things is good. For so as
nothing may be thought better than god. hit may not been doubted then that
b31e that no thing nys better than he nys good Certes reason^ shows that god
is so good that it proved by veraye force that parfyte good is in him / For if
God nys such he ne may not been^ prince of all thing / for certes something
possessing in it self parfyte good should be more worthy than god. And it
should semen that thilk thing were first and older than god. For we have showed
appertely that all things that been parfyt ben first. or things that been
imparfyte. And for thy for as much as that my resone or my process ne goo not
aweye without an end / we owen^ to grau^ten that the sovereign good is
rightful of sovereign parfyte good. And we have estabilisshed that the
sovereign good is very blissfulness. then mote it needs be that very
blissfulness is set in souerain good. B / This take I well quoth I / ne this ne
may not be withsayd in no manner / P. But I pray the quod she See now how
thou may prouen holyly / and withouten corrupcion^. this that we have said
that the souerayn god is full of right s^u^rayne good. B. In which manner quod
I. P. Wenestow ought quod she that the fader of all things have taken thilke
sovereign good any where out of him self. of which sovereign good men
proves that he is full. right as thou might thinken that god that has
blissfulness in him self / and thilk blissfulness that is in him were dyuerce
in substan^ce / For if thou wene that god has received thilke good out of him
self Thou mais^ wene that he that yaf thilke good to God be more worthy than
God / But I am beknowe and confess and that right dignely that god is right
worthy above al things. and if so be that this good be in him by nature but
that is dyuerce from him by wenyng reason syn we speken of god prince of all
things. feyne who so feyne may Who was he that conjoined these things to
gyder. and eke at last s^e well that a thing that is dyuerce fro any thing
that t^ilke thing nys not that same thing for which it is vnderst^nden to been
diuerce. then follows hit well that thilke thing / that by his nature is
dyuerce from sovereign good. that thing is not sovereign good But certes it
were a felonous cursednes to thinken that of him that no thing nys more worth.
For all way of all things the name of hem ne may not been better than her
begynner. For which I may concluden by right veraye reason. that thilke that
is beginning of all thing^s / thilke same thing is sovereign god in his
substan^ce B. Thou have said rightfully quod I ^ Philosophia / but we have
granted quod she that the s^uerayne good is blisfulnes. B. That is s^the quod
I. ^. Then quoth she we moten needs graunten and con^^ssen that thilke same
souerayn good be god. B. Certes quod I^ I ne may not deny ne withstand the
resons purposed. And I see w^ll that hit follows by strength of the
pr^mysses. P / love now quoth she if this be proved yet more f^rmely thus. That
there ne mowen not been two sovereign goods that been dyuerce among hem self /
For certes the goods that been dyuerce among hem self. that one is not that the
other is. Then^e ne mowen neyth^r of hem be parfyte / so as either of ^^m
lacks to other / but that / that nys not perfyte. men may seen ap^rtly that
it nys not sovereign / The things then that be soueraynly good ne mow by no
wey be d^^ce But I have well concluded that blissfulness and God been^ the
sovereign good. for which hit mote needs been that sovereign blissfulness is
sovereign dignite. B. No thing quod I i^ more sothfaste than this / ne more
ferme by reason^ ne a more worthy thing than god may not be concluded. Phi^a.
Upon these things then quoth she right as these geometriciens when they have
showed their proposicions been wont to bringen in things that they clepen
porrismes or declaracions of forsayde things / right so wole I give the here
as a corallarye or a mede of Crown. For why for as much as by the getyng of
bl^sfulnesse men been maked blisfull / And blissfulness is dignite / then^e hit
is manifest and open that by the getyng of dignyte men been maked blisfull
right as by the getyng of Justice. And by the getyng of sapyence they be maked
wise / right so needs by the semblable reason^ when they have gotten dyuynyte
they ^^e m^ad Gods / Then is every blisfull man^ a God. But certes by
nature there nys but one God. But by the participacion of dyuinyte there ne
lets ne distourbeth no thing that there ne be many Gods / B. This is
quod I a fair thing and a precious. clepe hit as thou will be hit Corallarie
or porrisme or mede of Crown or declaring / Phi^a / Certes quod she no thing
nys fayrer than is the thing that by reason should be added to these foresaid
things / B. What thing quoth I. Phi^a / So quod she as it seems that blisfulne^
conteyneth many things / it were for to weten whether that all these things
maken or conioynen as a manner body of blissfulness by the dyuersite of parties
of members or else if any of all these things be such that it accomplice by
him self the substan^ce of blisfulnes. so all these other things been
referred and brought to blisfulnes. that is to seye as to the chief of hem. B.
I would quoth I that thou made me clearly to understand what thou seyste and
what thou recordest me the foresaid things / P / have I not iugged quoth she that
blisfulnes is good / B. yes forsooth quoth I and that sovereign good. P / Add
then quoth she thilke good that is made blesfulnes to all the foresaid things
For thilke same blisfulnes that is demed to be souerayn suffisan^ce. thilke
self is souerayn power / souerayn reverence Sovereign cl^ren^s or noblesse and
souerayn d^lite / what sayste thou then of all these things. that is to
seye suffisan^ce. power and these other things / b^ne they then as members
of blisfulnes / or been they referred and brought to sovereign good / right as
all things that ben b^ought to the chief of ^em. B. I understand well quod I
what thou purposest to seek. but I desire for to (...) that thou show it to
me. P. Take now thus the dis^rec^on of this question quoth she / If all these
things quoth s^e weren members to felicite / then^e weren they dyuerce that one
from that other / and such is the nature of parties or of members / that
dyuerce members compowne a body / Bo^cius / Certes quod I. Hit has well be
showed here by forne that all these things been all one thing / Philosophia
/ Then been they no members quod she. For ellis hit should seem that
blesfulnes were coioyned all of one memb^e allone. But that is a thing which
may not be done Bo^cius. This thyng^ quod I then^e is not doubtous But I abide
to herkne the remenan^t of thy question. P. This is open and clear quoth she that
al other things be referrid and brought to good. For therefore is suffisan^ce
required. For hit is demed for to been good / And for thy is power required.
For men trowen also. that hit be good / And this same thing mowen we thinken
and coniecten / of reverence. of noblesse / and of delight. Then is sovereign
good the sum and the cause of all that ought to be desired. For why thilke
thing that withholdeth no good in it self / ne semblance of good / it ne may
not well in no manner be desired ne required / and the contrary / For thaugh
that things by her nature ne been not good. Al ga^es if men wenen^ that they
been^ good / yet ben they desired as th^ugh they weren^ verilich good. And
th^rfore it is said that men ought to wene by right that bou^te be the
sovereign fine and the cause of all the things that been to requiren^. But
certes thilke that is cause for which men requyren^ any thing / hit seems
that thilk same thing be most desired / As thus. if that a wighte would riden
for cause of hele. he ne desires not so mochell the mo^uyng to riden as the
effect of his health. Now then syn^ that all things been^ required for
the grace of good. they ne be not desired of all folk more thanne the same
good / But we have granted that blisfulnes is that same thing for which that
all these other things been^ desired. Then is hit thus that certes only
blissfulness is required and desired. by which thing it shows clearly that
of good and blissfulness is al one and the same substan^ce. B. I see not quod I
wherefore that men might discorden^ in this. Philosophia / And we han shewde
that god and very blisfulnes is al one thing Boece. That is soth quoth I. P.
Then^e mow we conclude sikerly / that the substan^ce of good is set in
thilke same god and in none other place

and som^e wexen in montaignes / And other wexe in mareys and other cleuen on

ell^s berith lightness the flambes up. And the weighte presses the earth a

As thus / right as we swolowen the mete that we receyuen. and ne think not
on hit. And as we draw our breath in slepyng that we wit not while we
slepen. For certes in the beestes the love of her lyuynges ne of her beeinges
ne comes not of the wilnyngis of the soul. but of the bigynnynges of nature.
for certes through constreynyng causes. will desires and embraces full often
times the death that nature dredeth. That is to seyne as thus / That a man^ may
be constreyned so by some cause that his will desires and takes the deeth /
which that nature hates and dredeth full sore / And som^e time we seen^ the
contrary / as thus / that the will of a wighte distourbeth and constrayneth
that. that nature alweye desires and requires / That is to seye the works of
generation. by the which generation only dwellith and is sustained the long
durabilite of mortal thingis / As thus This charity and this love that every
thing has to him self ne comes not of the moeuyng of the soul / but of the
entencion of nature. For the pourueance of god has yeuen to things that been

quod I of so many dyuerce and contrarious parties ne might never han ben

pleyestow or deceyuestow me that have so won^en me with thy resons. the house of
dedalus so entrelaced that it is unable to be unlaced that thou otherwhile
entrest there thou yssuest / and other while issuest there thou entrest Ne
foldest thou not to geder by replicacion of words a manner wonderful cercle or
enuiron^yng of the simplicite divine / for certes a litil here biforn^ when
thou began at blisfulnes. thou seydest that it is souerayn good. and that God
is the blisfulnes / for which thou yaf me as a couenable yeft that is to seyn^
that no wight nys blisful but if he be good also therewith. and seydest eke that
the form of good is the substan^ce of god and of blisfulnes. and saidest that
thilk one Is thilk same go^d that is required and desired of all the kind of
things. and thou prouedest in disputing that god governs all the things of
the world / by the governance of bou^te. and se^dest that all things would
obeyen to him / and s^ydest that the nature of evil is no thing. ^ th^se
things shewdest thou not with no res^ns taken fro without but by proves in
cercles and homelich known. The which proves drawn to hem self her feyth
and her accord eu^rich ^f hem of other / P / Then said she thus / I ne
s^orne not. ne pley^ / ne deceive the. But I have showed the t^ing that is
grettest over al things by the yefte of g^d that we whylome p^ayden. For this
is the form of dyu^ne substance that is such that hit ne slydeth not i^to
vtter^st foreyn things. ne receives not no stran^ge t^inges in him. But right
as Permemdes seyde in greek of thilk dyuine substan^ce ^ He said thus^ that
thilke dyuyne substan^ce tourneth the world and the moeuable cercle of things
/ while thilke dyuyne substan^ce keeps hit self withouten moeuynges / that is
to seyne that he moeueth never moo / and yet hit moeueth all other things /
But natheles if I have styred resons that be not taken fro without the compass
of the thing of the which we treten^ / But reasons that been bistowed within
compass there nys not why thou sh^ldest meruaillen^ / since thou have learned by
the sentence of Plato That needs the words mote been^ cosins to the things of
which they speken

When philosophye hadd songen softly and delitably the foresaid things / keeping
the dignite of her chere and the weighte of her words / I then that ne hadd
all utterly foryeten the weeping and the moeuyng that was set in mine heart.

toldest me / all be hit so that I had whilome foryeten hem for the sorrow of
the wrong that has be done to me / yet nevertheless they ne weren not al
utterly unknown to me / But this same is namely a right great cause of my
sorrow. so that as the governor of things is good. if that euyls mowen been

only. hew worthy it is to ben wondered upon / Thou considerest it well thy self
certainly. But yet to this thing there is yet another thing y joined more to be
wondered upon. For felonye is Emperice and floureth full of richesses / and
virtue nys not only without meedes. But it is cast under and fortroden under
the feet of felonous folk / and it abieth the torments instead of wicked
felon^s. Of all which things th^^ is no wight may meruaillen enough ne
compleynen that such things be done in the regne of god that all things wot
and all things may and n^ will not only but good things. P. Then said she
thus / Certes quoth she that were a great meruaille and an abasshing with out

That is to seyne that in the right ordeyne how^ of somoche a fader and an
ordeygnour of meyne that the vessels that been foul and vile should been

of the wh^^ regne I speak. That certes the good folk be (...) mighty and
shrewes been alweye out cast and fieble. Ne the vice^ be never moo without

alweye to good folk / and infortune comes all weye to wicked folk. And thou
shall well known many things of this kind that shulle cessen thy pleyntes.

THen^e said I thus. O I wondre me that thou behetest me so greet things. ne
I ne doubt not. that thou ne maiste well parfourme that thou behetest / But I
preye the this that thou ne tarry not. to tell me thilk things that thou haste
meoued. First quod she thou must needs know that good folk been alweye
strong and mighty And the shrewes been feeble and deserte. and naked of all
strengthes. And of these things certes euerich of them is declared and showed
by other. for as good and evil ben two contraries if so be that good be
stidfaste. then^e shows the feblesse of evil al openly / And if thou know
clearly the freelnes of evil. the stidfastnes of good is known. but for as
much as the feyth of my sentence shall be the more ferme and habou^dante / I
wol goon by that oo weye and by that other. and I wole conferme the things
that b^ne pourposed now on this side and now on that side. Two things there
ben in which theff^cte of all the deeds of mankind stands / That is to seyne
will and power / And if that one of these two failleth / there nys no thing
that may be done. For if that will lakketh there nys no wight that undertakes
to do that he wol not done / And if power failleth the will nys but in ydell.
and stant for naught and thereof comes it. that if thou s^e a wighte that would
geten that he may not geten^ / thou maiste not doubt that power ne failleth
him to haven that he would. B. This is open and clear quod I. ne it ne may not
ben denied in no manner. P. and if thou s^e a wight quoth she that has done. that
he would done. thou nylt not doubt / that he ne has had power to done it / b /
no quoth I / p. and in that that euy wight may in that men holden them mighty to
done a thing. in somoche as a man is mighty to done a thing. in so much men
hold him mighty / and in that that he ne may. in that m^n demen him to be
feeble / B / I confess it well quoth I. P. Remember the quod she that I have gadred
and showed by for said resons. that all the entencion of the will of
mankind / which that is lad by dyuerce studies hastes to comen to
bl^sfulnesse / B / It remembers me well quod I that it has been showed /
Phi^a. And records the naught then quoth she. that blissfulness is thilke same
good that men requiren so that when blissfulness is required of al B. It
records me not quod I for I have it all weye in my memory fixed / Phi^a /
All folk then quod she good and eke badd enforcen hem without diff^rence
of en^encion to comen to good. B. This is very consequence (...) I. P^i^^. And
certain is quod she that by geting of good ^ee men maked good. B. That is
c^rtayn quoth I. Phi^a / Then get^n good men^ that the^ desiren. B. So it seems
quod I / P. But wicked folk quod she if they geten the good that they desiren
they ne mowen not be wicked / B. So it is quoth I / P. Thenn^ so as that one and
that other quoth she desiren the good / and the good folk g^ten the good. and
naught the wicked folk ^ then^e hit is no doubt that the good folk ne be
mighty and wicked folk be feeble. B. Who so that ever doub^eth of this he ne
may not considere the nature of things ne the consequence of resons. P. And
over this quoth she if that there ben two things that ^an oo same purpose by
kind. And that one of hem pursues and perfourmeth that same thing by naturel
office and that other ne may not done thilk office naturelle but follows by
other manner / than is couenable to nature him that accomplissheth his purpose
kindly / and yet he ne accomplissheth not his own purpose whether as these two
demest thou for more mighty. B. If that I coniecte quoth I that thou would
seye. Algates I desire yet to harken hit more plainly of the. P. Thou nylt not
than deny quod she that the meouement of gooyng nys in men by kind. B. No
forsothe quoth I. P. Ne thou doubtest not quoth she that thilke naturell office of
going ne be the office of fete / Boecius I ne doubt it not quod I.
Philosophia. Than quod she if that a wighte be mighty to meoue and gooth up
on his fete / and another to wh^m thilke naturele office of fete lakketh.
enforseth him to go crepyng on his hand which of these two ought to be holden
the more mighty by right B. Knytt forth quod I the remenant / P / For no wight
ne doubts. that he that may gone by naturel office of fete ne be more mighty
than he that ne may not / But the sovereign good quoth she. that is even like
purposed to the good and to the badde. the good folk seken it by naturel
office of virtues / And shrewes enforcen hem to geten hit by dyuerce couetises
of erthely things / which that nys no naturell office to geten thilke
sovereign good / Trowest thou that hit be any other wise. Boecius. Nay quoth I.
for the consequeence is opene and showing of things that I have granted /
that needs good folk moten been mighty. And shrewes moten been feeble and
vnmyghty Philosophia / Thou rennest a right by forne me quod she / And this is
the Iuggement. That is to seyn^ I Judge of right / as these leches ben went to
hopen of seek folk when they apperceyuen that nature is redressed and
withstandeth to the malady. but for I see the now all ready to the withstanding
/ I shall show the more thilk and continuell reasons / For look how greatly
shows the feblenesse and infirmite of wicked folk that ne mowen not comen to
her naturell entencion ledeth hem / And yet all most thilke naturel entencion^
constreyneth hem / and what were to demyn then^e of shrewes / if thilke
naturell help hadd forleten him / the which naturell help of entencion goth
alwey biforn^ hem / And is so great that uneath hit may be ouercomen.
Considere then^e how great defaute of power. and how great feblesse there is in
wicked felonous folk As who seith the gret^er thing that is coueyted and the
desir not acc^mplissh^d. of the less might is ^e that coueyteth it and may not
accomplisshe. and for thy philosophy seith thus by souerain go^de. ne shrewes
ne requiren not light m^des ne veyn^ games which they ne may not folowen ne
holden but they faillen of thilk sum of the height of things. that is to
said souerayn^ good / ne these wretches ne comen not to t^^ff^c^e of sovereign
good. the which they enf^^cen hem only to geten^ by nights and by days ^ in
getyng of which good^ the strength of good folk is ^^l well ysene. for right
as thou might demen him mighty of going that gooth on his fe^te till he
might comen to thilke place. fro the which place there ne lay no weye
f^rther to be goone / right so must thou needs demen^ him for right mighty
which that geteth and a^teyneth to the ^nde of all things which that been
to desiren^ by yonde^ the which end there nys no thing to desire. of the
which power of good folk. men may conclude. that we wicked men semen to be
bareyne and naked of all strength. for why forleten they virtues and folowen
vices. nys it not for that they ne known not the goods / But what thing is
more feeble and more caytiue than is the blindness of Ignorance or ellis they
known well which things they oughten follow / but lechery and couetise
overthrows hem mystorned. And certes so does distemperan^ce to feeble men.
that mow not wrastelen ayeyne these vices / Ne know they not well that they
forleten the good wilfully And tournen^ hem wilfully to vices / And in this
wise they ne forleten not only to be mighty. but they forleten all utterly in
any wise for to ben. For they that forl^ten the com^une fine. of all things
that been. they forleten also therewith all for to been. And perau^nture hit
should semen to som^e folk that this were a meruaille to seyne. that shrewes
which that conteynen the more perties of men^ ne been not ne han no being /
but nath^les hit is so. and thus stante this thing for they that be shrewes /
I deny not but that they be shrewes. but I deny simply and plainly that they
ne be not. ne han no being. for right as thou might seyne of the careyne
of a man that hit were a deed man. so grant I well forsothe that vycious folk
ben wicked / but I ne may not absolutely and simply grant that they ben. For
thilke thing that withholdeth order and kepith nature / thilke thing is and
has being / But what thing fails that / that is to seye / he that forleteth
naturel order / he forletith thilk being that is set in his nature But thou
wolt seyn^ the shrewes mowen^. certes that ne deny y not / but certes her
power ne descends not of strength but of feblesse. for they mowen done
wickedness / the which they ne might not. if they mighten dwellen in the
form and in the doing of good people / and thilk power shows euydently that
they mowen right naught. for so as I have gadred and proved a litel here
byforn^. that evil is not / and so as shrewes. may only but shrewdness. This
conclusion is all clear. that shrewes ne mowen right naught ne han no power /
And for as much as thou understand which is the strength of this power of
shrewes / I have diffinisshed a litel here byforne. that nothing is so mighty
as sovereign good. B. that is soth quoth I / P. Is there any wight then^e quoth she
that weneth that men mowen done all things / B. noman^ quoth I. but he be out of
his wi^te / P. But certes shrewes mowen done evil quoth she. B. ye would god quoth I
that they might done none / P / Then quoth she so as he that is ^^ghty to done
only good things may done all things / And they that been mighty to done
evil things. ne mowen not all things. then^e is it open thing and manifest
that they that mowen done evil ben of less power And yet to prove this
conclusion / there helps me I have showed here biforne. that all power is to
be nombred among things that men oughten to require. and I have showed that
all thinge^ that oughten ben desired / be referred to god right as to a manner
height of her nature. But for to mowen done evil and felonye ne may not been
referred ^o God / then is not evil of the nombre of things that oughten to
been desired and required / then^e is it open and clear that the power ne the
moeuyng of shrewes nys no power. And of all these things it shows well that
the good folk been certainly mighty / And the shrewes doubtelesse vnmighty /
And it is clear and open that thilke sentence of Plato is vereye and s^th. that
seyth that only wisemen^ may done that they desiren. And shrewes mowen
haunten^ that hem likes. but that they desiren That is to seyne to come to
sovereign good. they ne han no power to accomplisshe that / For shrewes done
what him lust / when by tho things in which they d^l^ten / they wenen to
atteyne to thilke good that they desiren / but they ne geten ne atteyne not
thereto / For vices ne comen not to blissfulness

SEstow not than in how greet fil^h these shrewes ben ywrapped. And with which
clerenesse these good folk shynen / In this shows it well that to good folk
ne lakketh never moo her medes / ne shrewes lakken never moo tourmentes / For
of all things that be done. thilke thing for which any thing is done. It
seems as by right that thilke thing be the mede of that / As thus / if a man
ren^eth in the stady or in the for^^ng for the crown / then^e lies the mede
in the crown for which he renneth. and I have showed that bl^sfulnes is
thilke same good for which that al things ben done. then^e is thilk same good
purposed to the works of mankind. right a a commune mede^ which mede ne may
not be disseuered from good folk For no wighte as by right from thensforth that
him l^cketh goodness ne shall be cleped good. For which thing folk of good
manners her medes ne forsaken hem never mo For all ^e it so that shrewes waxen as
wood as hem lust against good folk. yet nevertheless the crown of wisemen^ ne
shall not fallen ne faden^ for foreyne shrewdness. ne bynym^en not fro the
courage of good people her propre honor But if any wight reioysed him of
goodness. that he had taken fro without. As who seith if a man^ had his
goodness of any other man^ than^ of him self. certes he that yaf him thilke
goodness. or else som^e other wight might byneme it him / But for as much as
to every wighte his propre bounte yeueth him his mede / then at erste shall
he faillen of mede. when he forleteth to be good / And ^^te last so as all
mede^ ben required. for men wenen that ^hey be good / who is he that nolde
deem. that he that is right mighty of good were parteles of mede. And of what
mede shall he be reguerdon^d. Certes of right fair mede. and right great abouen
all medes. Remember the of thilk noble corallarie that I yafe the a litell
here byforne / and gadere it to g^dre in this manner. So as God him self is
blissfulness. then^e is it clear and certain that all good people ben maked
blisfull / for they ben good. And thilke people that been blisfull. it accords
and is couenable to be gods. then^e is the mede of people such / that no day
ne shall enpeyren it ne no wickedness shall dyrken hit / ne power of no wight ne
shall not amenuse hit / That is to seyne that ben^ maked gods / and since it is
thus that good men^ ne failen never moo of her mede / certain noman^ ne may
doubt of the vndepartable pain of shrewes. that is to seyne that the pain of
shrewes departs not from hem self never moo For so as good and evil and
pain and medes be contrary. hit mote needs be / that right as we see betiden
in guerdone of good that also mote the pain of the evil answer by the
contrary parties to shrewes / Now than so as bou^te and prowess been mede to
good folk / also is shrewdness it self tourmente to shrewes / Then^e who so
ever is entetched and defouled with pain / he ne doubts not. that he is
entetched and defouled with evil / If shrewes than woollen preysen hem self /
may hit semen to hem that they ben withouten party of tourment since they ben
such / that the vtterest wickedness / that is to s^ye wicked ^hewe^ which is
the vtterest and worst kind of shrewdness ne de^ouleth ne entetcheth not hem
only / but enfecteth and enuenymeth greetly. And also look on shrewes / that been the contrary party of good men / how great pain felowshippeth and
fouleth hem. For th^^ host learned a litell here by forn^ that all thing that
is and h^th being. is one / and thilk same one is good / than is this the
conseq^ence / that h^t seems well that all thing that is and bath being
(...) good / That is to seyne / as who seith. that being and unity and
goodness is all one. An^ in this manner it follows than that all thing that
failleth to be good / it seynteth for to be and for to b^n any manner being.
where fore ^it is that shrewes stynten^ for to be that they weren. But thilke
other form of mankind. That is to seyne the form of the body without
shows that these shrewes w^ren whilome men^ ^ where fore when they been
perverted and turned into malice / Certes then they han forlorn^ the nature
of mankind / but so a^ only bounte and prowess may enhaunsen every man.
over men / then mote it needs be that shrewes which that shrewdness has
cast out / of the condition of mankind / ben put under the merit and
deserte of men / then betideth it that if thou see a wighte which that is
transfourmed into vices. thou maiste not wen^ that he be a man. For if he be
ardau^te in Avarice and that he be a rauenour by violence of foreyne richesse.
thou shall seyne that he is like a wolf / and if he be felonnous and
withouten rest / and exercise his tongue to chidynges / thou shall liken him
to the hou^de / and if he be a preuy awaitour hid / and rei^yssith him to
rauisshe by wyle^ / thou shall seyne him like to the fox wh^lpis / And if he
be distempred and quaketh for I^^ / Men shall wenen that he bears the
couraige of a Lion. And if he be dredefull and fleying and dredeth things
which that ne oughten not to be dredd / men shall hold him like to the

wilnen to done evil / than is it more wretchedness to mowen done evil.
without which mowyng the wretched will should languisshe without effect.
Th^n^e s^th every of th^se things has his ^retchednesse that is to seyne
will to done e^ill. and mowing to d^ne evil. it mote needs be that they
shrewes be constreyned by the vnsel^nesse that willen and mowen and performen
felonyes and shrewdness. B / I accord me quoth I. ^ut I desire greatly that
shrewes lost seen thilke vn^elynesse. That is to seyne that shrewes were
dispoyled of mowing to do evil P / So shullen they quod she sooner per^^en^ure

shows hit clearly that thilke wretchedness is withouten end / the which is
certain to be perdurable / B. Certes quod I this conclusion is hard and
wonderful to grant. But I know well that it accords much to things that
I have granted here bi^orn^. Phi^a. Thou haste quod she right estymacion of
thie / But wh^ so ever wene that hit be an hard thing to accord him to a
conclulion. hit is right that he show that som^e of the premysses ben falls /
or ellis he most show that the collacion of proposicions nys not spedeful to
a necessary conclusion And if it be not so / but that the premysses be
granted there nys not why he should have the argument / for this thing that I
shall tell now. ne shall not seem less wonderful but of things that been

is purposed bi^^rne B. What is that quod I. P / Certes quod she / that y^ /
that these wicked shrewes b^e more blisfull or ellis less wretches. that abyen
the tourmentes that they have deserved. than if no pain of Justice ne

the manner of men that arn shrewes been corriged and chastiged by vengean^ce /
and that they been brought to the right weye by the dread of tourmente. ne for
that they yeuen to other folks exsample to fleen fro vices / But I understand
it yet in another manner. that shrewes be more vnsely when they be not
punisshed / Al be hit so that there ne be had no reason of law of correccion
ne none exsample of loking / B / And what manner shall that be quoth I other than
had be told here biforn^ / P. Have we not granted then^e quoth she. that good
folk ben blisful / and shrewes be wretches / B. Yi^ quoth I. P / then^e quoth she if
any good were added to the wretchedness of any wight nys he not m^re blisful
than he that ne has no medeling of good in his solitary wretchedness. B. so
seems it quoth I. P. and what saistow then quoth she / of thilke wretch that
lacks all goods / so that no good is medeled in his wretchedness for
which he is a wretch / that there be yet another evil annexed and knytt to him
/ shall not men demen him more vnsely than^ thilke wretch of which the
vnse^inesse is releued by the participacion of som^e good. B / whi should he
not quoth I. P. then certes quoth she han shrewes when they be punysshed somewhat of
good annexed to her shrewdnes Tha^ i^ to seyne the same pain that they suffren
/ that is good by the reason of Justice. and when thilke same shrewe^ es^ap^n
without tourmente / then han they yet some what m^re of ^uil yet over the
wickedness that they han done. that i^ to seyne defaute of pain the which
thou haste granted (...) evil for the desert^ of felonye. b. I ne may not
deny it quod I. Phi^a. Much more then quod she ben shrewes vnsely ^ when
they be wrongfully delivered from pain. than when they be punysshed by
rightful vengeance^ But this is open thing and clear that hit y^ right that
shrewes be punysshed. and hit is wickedness and wrong when they ^sca^en
unpunished. Boecius / Who mygh^e deny hit quod I. Phi^a. But quod she may
any man^ deny that all that is right ne is good. And ^^so the cont^arie that
all that is wroong is wicked. Boeciu^. Ce^tes quod I these things be clear
enough And that we han concluded here by forn^ / But I pray the tell me if
thou accordest to leten no torment to the sowles after that the body is ended
with the death / that is to seyn^ Vnderstandestow ought that souls han any
tourment after the death of the body. P. Certes quod she and that right greet.
Of which souls quod she I trow that som^e been tourmented by asprenesse of
pain. And sowles I trow be excercised by a purging meekness. but it is not
my conseylle to determyne of these peynes / But I have trauailled and told yet
hidderto for thou should known that the mowing of shrewes. which mowyng the
seems to been unworthy nys no mowyng / And eke of shrewes of which thou
pleynedest. that they ne were not punysshed that thou would see / or they ne
were never moo without the tourmentes of her wickedness. And of the license
of mowyng to done evil. that thou preydeste that it might sone be ended. And
that thou would feyne lernen that hit should not long endure / And that
shrewes be more vnsely if they were of longer during / and most vnsely if
they were perdurable / And after this I have showed the that more vnsely been
shrewes when they escapen without her rightful pain. than when they be
punysshed with rightful vengeance / And of this sentence follows hit that
then^e be shrewes constreyned at last with grievous tourmentes when men wene
that they be not punisshed. B When I considere this resons quod I / I ne trow
not that men seye any thing more verily. and if I turn ayeyne to the studies
of men^ who is he to whom I should seem that he ne should not only leven these
things but gladdely harken him / P. Certes quoth she so it is / but men may not
/ for they han there eyen^ so wont to the derkenesse of erthely things. that
they ne may not liften^ up to the light of clear stedfastnes. but they be like
to briddes of which the night lightneth her lokinges. and the day blinds
hem. for when men loken not the order of things but her lusts or tale^tes
They wene that either the leave of mowyng to do wickedness or ellis the escaping
withouten^ pain be welefull. But considere the Iuggement of the perdurable
law. for if thou conferme thy couraige to the best things / thou ne have no
mede of no Judge to give the price or mede / for thou have joined the self to
the most exellent thing. And if thou have enc^^^^d the studice to the wicked
things ne seek no fore^n^ wreker out of thy self / For thou thy self haste
thri^t thy self ^ in the wicked things like as thou might loken by dyuerce
times the foul earth and the heuene And that all other things stinten^ fro
without / so that thou ne say no things more. then should it seem to the as
by only reason of loking that thou were now in the sterres and now in the earth.
But the people ne looks not on these things. what then^e. shall we than
approchen us to him that I have showed that they be l^ke to beestes / and
will thou s^ye of this if that a man^ had a^^ forlorn^ his sight And hadd all
foryeten that he eu^^ s^we And wened that no thing ne failled him. of the
perfecci^n of mankind. Now then we which that myghten^ seen the sam^

not the people to that that I shall ^^yne the which thing ye fasteyned by a
strong foundment of reason. That is to seyne that more vnsely been they that
done wrong to other folk than they that the wrong suffer. B / I would here
thilke same reason quod I / P / Denyest thou quod she that all shrewes ne been
worthy to han tourmente. B / Nay quod I / P. But quoth she I am certain by many
reasons that shrewes been vnsely / B. It accords quod I. Phi^a. Then ne
doubtest thou not quod she. that thilke folk that been worthy of tourment that
they ne be wretches / B / It accords well quod I / P / If thou were then^e
set a Ingge or a knower of things whether trowestow that men should
tourmenten hem that has do wrong or ellis hem that suffered the wroong. B. I
doubt not quod I that I nold do suffisan^t satisfaccion / to hem that have
suffered wrong by the sorrow of hem that has done wroong / Phi^a. Then seems
hit quod she that the doer of wroong is more wretch than he that suffered the
wroong. Boccius / That follows well quod I / Phi^a / Then quod she by these
causes and by other causes that be enforced by the same root that filth or
sin by the propre nature of hit makes hem wretches / And hit shows well
that the wrong that men done nys not the wretchedness of him that the wrong
receives / but the wretchidnesse of him that does the wrong But certes quod
she these orators / or ellis these advocates done all the contrary for they
enforcen hem to commoeue the Iugges that han pity of hem that han ^uffred and
received the things which that been greuouse and aspre And yet men should have
more rygtfully pity of hem that done the greuaunces and the wroonges / The
which shrewes hit were a more couenable thing that the accusours or the
Advocates not wroth but piteous and debonair ledden shrewes which that han
done wroong to the Iuggeme^t. like as men leden seek men^ to the leche. for
that they shulden seken out the ^aladie of sin by torment / And by this
couenan^te either thentent of the Advocates should cessen^ in all. or else if
thoffice of the advocates would better preufi^en to men. It should be turned in
to the habit of accusacion / That is to seyn^ they should accuse shrewes and
not excuse hem. And eke the shrewes hem self it were leuefull to hem to seen
at any clifte / the virtue which that they han forleten / And that they sawen
that they should put adowne the filthes of her vices. by the tou^men^es of
peynes they ne oughten not right for the recompensacion for to get hem boute
and prowess / which that they han lost. demen^ and holden that thilke peynes
weren^ tourmentes to hem / And eke they welden refuse the attendence of her
advocates and taken^ him to her Iuges and her accusours. For the which but
betideth that as to the wise folk there nys no place leten to h^te / that is to
seyne. that hate ne has no place among wis^men^ / for no wighte wole haten
good men^. But if he were over much a fool / And for to haten shre^es. hit is
no reason / for right as languysshyng is malady of body / right so been vices
and sin malady of couraige / And so as we ne demen naught that they which
that been seek of their body. been worthy to been hated but rather worthy of
py^e. Well more worthy not to been hated. But for to been hadd in pity. been
they of the which the thought is constreyned by felonous wickedness. that is
more cruel than any languisshing of body

to the quod I so do Phi^a / Tho spacke she right as by another bygynnyng and

progressions of meouable nature / and all that meoueth in any manner. takes his
causes / his order and his fourmes of the stablenesse of dyuine thought / And
thilke dyuine thought that is set and put in the toure That is to seyne. in
the heighte of the simplicite of God Stablissheth many manner guises to the
things that been to doon^. The which manner when that men loken it in the pure
clennesse of the dyuine Intelligence is cleped pourueyannce. But when thilke
manner is referred by men to things that hit meoueth or disponeth than of old
men hit was cleped destenye. the which things if that any whighte looks well
in his thought / the strength of that one and of that other he shall lightly
mow seen. that these two things been dyuerce. For pourueyance is thilke
dyuyne reason / that is establisshed in the souerayn prince of things / the
which pourueyance disponeth all things. But certes destenye is the
disposicion and the ordenaunce cle^yng to meouable things / by the which
disposicion the pourueyan^ce knitteth all things in her order. For
pourueyance enbraseth all things to heepe all th^ugh they be dyuerce / and
al thaugh they be Infinite But desteny certain departs and ordeyneth all
things singlerly and dyuydeth in me^uyng in places. in forms / in times as
thus. late the unfolding of temporal ordenau^ce assembled and coned in the

and o^nyng dyuided and vnfolden late that be called destenye. And al be hit
so that these things ben diverse yet nevertheless hanged that one of that
other. for why the order destynale proceeds of the simplicite of purueyan^ce
For right as a w^rkman perceyueth in his thought the form of a thing that ^e
wole make and meoueth the effect of the w^rk / And ledeth that ^e ^^d looked
beforn^ in his thought simply and presently by corp^ral ordenan^ce. c^^tes
right so god in his purueyance disponeth singlerly and s^ably the things that
be to don / but he administreth in manners and in diverse times by desteny
thilke same things that ^e has disponed then^e whether destenye be
excercised either by som^e dyuyne spirits servants to the dyuyne puruean^ce
/ or else by some soul. or else by all nature seruyng to god / or else by the
celestial moeuinges of sterres / or ellis by the virtue of angels. or else by
dyuerce subtilite of devils / or else by any of hem. or else by hem all / the
destinall ordenan^ce is wouen and accomplisshed. Certes it is open thing that
the puruean^ce is an vnmeouable and simple form of things to done / And the
meonable bond and the temporal ordenan^ce of thingis which that the dyuine
simplicite of purueance has ordained to done that is desteyne / For which it
is that al thingis that been put under desteyne ben certes subgi^ttes unto
puruean^ce. to which pur^ean^ce destenye it self is subgiect and under / but
som^e things been put under purueance that surm^u^ten the ordinan^ce of
destine. and tho ben thilke that stably ben fix^d nigh to the first godhed they
surmou^ten the order of destynale mouablete. For right as cercles tornen^
about a same center or about a point / thilk c^rcle that is Innerest or most
with in / he joins to the simplesse of the myddel / and is as it were a
center or a point to that other cercles that tornen about him. and thilk that
is vtterest compassed by a larger enuironyng is unfold by larger spaces / in
somoche as it is fertherest fro the middelest simplicite of the point. and if
there be any thing that knitteth and felaushippeth him self to thilk middel
point / it is constreyned into simplicite. that is to sey into vnmouablete. and
it cessith to ben shad and to flitte diusly / right so by semblable reason thilk
thing that deperteth fortherest fro the first thought of god ^ it is vnfolden
and also submitted to gretter bonds of destyne / and in somoch is the thing
more free and lowse fro dignite / as it axeth and holds nerre to thilke
Center of things. That is to seyne to god. And if the thing cleueth to the
steadfastness of the thought of god and be without meouyng. certes it
^urmounteth the n^cessite of destenye / Then^e ^uche comparison as is skiling
to understanding and of thing that was engendered to thing that is of time to
eternite. And of the cercle to the center right so is the order of meouable
destyne to to st^ble simplicite of pourueyance / Thilk ordenance meoueth the
heaven and the sterres and attemprith the element^s to g^dre among hem self. and
transformeth hem by en^r^^h^ungeable mutacion. And thilke same order neweth
a^eyne all things growing and falling a down by semblab^e progressions of
seeds and of sexus / That is to s^^n^ male and female. And thi^ ilk order
constreyneth the f^r^un^^ and the deeds of men^ by a band of causes not able
to be vn^ounden. The which destynale causes when they pas^^n out fro the
begynnynges of vnmeouable pourueya^^ce (...) mo^e needs be that they ne be
not mutable. A^ thus. be the things well governed if that the simplicite
dwellin^ in the dyuyne thought shows forth the order ^f c^uses unable to be
^owed. And this order constreyneth by the ^ropre stable^e the meouable t^inges
or else they shulden fl^^e fo^^ly. For which hit (...) that things semen
confuse and trowblye to us men^. For we ne mowen not considere thilke
ordenaunce. Nevertheless the propre man^re of (...) thing dressing him to god
disponeth hem all ^ For there nys no thing done for evil. for thilke thing
that is dene by wicked folk nys not done for evil / the which shrewes as I
have showed full plenteously seek good But wicked error mystorneth hem / ne the
order coming fro the point of souerain good ne enclineth not fro his bygyn^yng
/ but thou may say what unrest may ben a wors confusion then^e that good
men han sometime aduersite and sometime prosperity / and shrewes han now also
things that they desiren and now things that they haten / wheder men live now
in such hol^nesse of thought. As who seith. be men now so wise / that such
folk as they demen to ^e good folk or shrewes. that it mote needs be that folk
be such as they wenen But in this manner domes of men discorden / that thilke
men^ that som^e folk demen worthy of mede. other folk deem hem worthy of
torment / but ^ate us grant I suppose that some man^ may well deem or know the
good people and the bad May he then^e know and see thilk Innerest
attemperan^ce of courage as it has be wont to be said of bodies / as who seyth
May a man^ speken^ of complexions and attemperan^ce of bodies / ne it ne is not
/ as who seith but it is lik a marvel or a miracle to hem that ne known it
not. whi that sweet things be couenable to some bodies that been hole / and to
som^e people bitter things be couenable. and also whi some people ben helped
with light medicines / and som^e people ben^ holpen^ with bittir medicines / but
natheles tho that knowen^ the manner and the actemperan^ce of hele and of
malady ne meruaileth it no thing / but what other thing seems health of
corages but bounte / and what other thing seems malady of couraige but vices
/ Who is else keeper of good and driuer awey of evil / but God the governor and
lether of though^es. The which God when he has beholden^ from the high toure
of his pouruean^ce / he knows what is couenable to any wighte / and leneth
hem that he wot well that is couenable to hem. lo hereof comes and hereof is
done this miracle of the order destynable / when god that all knows does
such thing of which thing unknowing folk ben^ astonyed. but for to constreyne
as who seith but for to comprehend and tell a few things of the dyuine
depnesse / the which that mannys reason may understand. Thilk man^ that thou
wenest to been right Just and right keeping of equite. the contrary of that
seems to the dyuine pouruean^ce that all wot / And lucan my familier tellith
that the vyctoriouse cause liked to the gods / and the causes ouercomen
likes to Caton^ / Then what so ever thou maiste seen that is done in this
world unhoped or ellis vnknowen^ / certes hit is the right order of things
But as to thy wicked opinion / hit is a confusion / but I suppose that som^e
man^ be so well thewed that the dyuyne Iuggement and the Iuggement of mankind
accorden hem to geder of him / but he is so vnstidfaste of courage. that if any
aduersite come to him / he wole forleten perauenture to continue Innocence /
by the which he ne may not wythholden fortune / then^e the wise dispensacion^
of god spares him the which man aduersite might enpey^en. for that god will
not him to trauaille / to whom that travail nys not couenable. Another man^ is
parfyte in all virtues and y^ an holy man and nygh to god so that the
pourueance of god would deem that it were a felonye that he were towched with
any aduersitees. so that he wole not suffer that such a man^ be with any
bodily maladye meoued. But so as said the philosophre / the more excellent is
by me said in great that virtues han edefied the body of the holy man / and
often time it betideth that the so^me of things that been to done is taken to
govern to good f^lk. for that the malice habondan^t of shrewes should been
abated / and God yeueth and departs to other folk prosperitees and
aduersitees medeled to heepe after the qualite of her couraigis / and remordeth
som^e folk by aduersitees. for they ne should not waxen proud by long
welefulnesse / and other folk he suffers to be trauailled with hard things
for that they should confermen the virtues of couraige by the excercitacion of
usage of patience. And other folk d^eden more than they oughten the which
they myghten well beren / and som^e despise that they mow not bear. And thilk
folk god ledeth into experience of hem self by aspre and sorouful things And
many other folk have brought honorable renom^es of this world by the price of
glorious deeth. And som^e men that ne mow not been ouercomen by tourment. han
yeuen ensample to other folk that virtue may not been ouercomen by aduersitees
/ And of all these things there nys no doubt that they ne been done
rightfully and ordeynly to the parfyte good of hem to whom we seen these
things betyde. For certes that aduersitees comes sometime to shrewes / and
sometime that they desiren hit comes of these forsaid causes and of sorouful
things that betiden to shrewes Certes no man ne wondreth / for all men wene
that they han deserved hit. and that they ben of wicked merit. of which
shrewes the tourmente agasteth sometime other to done felonyes / and sometime it
amendeth hem that suffers the torments / and the prosperity that is yeuen to
shrewes. shows a great argument ^o good people / what thing they should demen
of thilke welfulnes. which prosperity men seen often serve to shrewes / in which
thing I trow that god dispe^seth For perauenture the nature of some man is so
outhrowing to evil and so vncouenable that the nedy pouert of his household
might rather agreue him to done felonies. and to the malady of him god puts
remedy to yeuen him richesse. and som^e other man^ beholds his conscience
defouled with sins and makes comperison of this fortune and of him self /
and dredeth perauenture that the blisfulnes of which the usage is Joyful to
him. and the l^sing of thilk blisfulnes ne be not sorouful to him / and
therefore he would change his manners. and for he dredeth to lose his fortune he
forleteth his wickedness. to other folks welfulnesse is ^euen unworthily /
the which overthrows hem into destruccion^ that they han deserved. and to
some other folk is yeuen power to punisshen for that hit shall be cause of
continuacion and e^cercising to good folk and cause of torment to shrewe^.
for as there n^s none allian^ce b^twix good folk and shrewes. ne shrewes ne
mow not accorden among hem self / And whi not. for that shrewes dis^orden of
him self by her vices. the which vices all to renden her conscience^ and done
oftyme things the which things when they han done hem / they deem that tho
things ne should not han be done. for which thing the souerain purueance has
maked oftyme miracle. so that shrewes han maked shrewes to ben good men / for
when that some shrewes seen that they suffer wrongfully felonies of other
shrewes / they waxen eschau^ed in to hate of hem that annoyed hem and retournen
to the fruit of virtue. than they studien to be unlike to hem that they han
hated. Certes only is this the dyuine might. to the which might. evils ben
than good when it uses the evils couenably and draws out the effect of any
good / as who seith that evil is good on^e^^ to the might of god. for the might
of god ordeyneth th^^^ evil to good / for one order enbraceth al things / so
that what wight deperteth from the reason of thilke order that is assigned to
him. algates yet he slideth into another order. so that nothing is leueful to
folly in the royame of divine purueance. as who seith nothing is without
ordenance in the royame of divine purueance / since that the right strong god
governs al things in this world. for it is not leuefull for men^ to
comphende by wit ne vnfolden by word all the subtle ordenance and the
disposicion of the divine intent / for only it ought to suffice to han looked
that god him self maker of al natures ordeyneth al thingis to good while that
he hastes to withholde the thingis that he has maked into his semblan^ce that
is to seye fo^to withholden the thingis into good. for he him self is good / he
chasith out al evils fro the bound of his cominaltees by the order of the
necessite destynable / for which it folweth that if thou look the purueance
ordening the thingis that men^ wenen be outrageous or habondant in erthes thou
shall not seen in no place no thing of evil. but I see now that thou art
charged with the weighte of the question and weary with length of my reason and

p. as men done quoth she any thing ^or grace of any other thing / then^ no another
thing than thilk thing that men entenden to done bitideth by some causes it is
cleped hap right as a man dalf the erthes because of tilling of the field / and
found there a gobett of gold bidoluen. then^e wene folk that it is bifalle by
fortunus betiding. but forsooth it is not of naught. for it has his propre
causes / of which causes the course vnforseyn^ and unware seems to han maked
hap. for if the tiller of the field ne delfe not in the earth. and if the hider
of the gold. ne had hid the gold in thilke place the gold ne had not ben
fonden / these ben then^e the causes of the abbreging of fortuyt hap / the
which abregyng of fortuyt hap. comes of causes of encou^tring or flowing to

Then^e said I thus / now am I confounded by a more hard doubt than^ I was.
P. what doubt is that quoth she / for certes I coniecte now by such things thou
art trobled. b / it seems quoth I to repugnen and to contrary greetly that god
knows biforn^ al things / and that there is any fredom or liberte / for if so
be that god looks al things by forn^ ne god ne may not ben deceived in no
manner / then mote it needs be that al things the which that the puruean^ce
of god has seen biforn^ to come / for which if that god knows to forn^ not
only the works of men. but also her cou^seiles and her wills / then^e ne shall
there be no liberte of arbitre. ne certes there may be none other deed ne no will
/ but thilk dyuine purueance that ne may be deceived has ^eled beforn^ / for
if that they might writhen awey in other manner than^ they be purueyed. then^e
ne should there not be no steadfast pscience of thing to come. but rather an
uncertain opinion. which thing to trowen of god / y deem it felony and
vnleueful / ne I ne prove not thilk same reason. as who seith I ne allow not or
I ne preyse not thilk reason / by which some men wene that they mow assoilen ^o
vnknytte the knot of this question. for certes they seye that thing is not to
come for that the puruean^ce of god has seen toforn^ / that hit is to comen /
but rather the contrary. and that is this. that for that the thing is to comen
/ that therefore ne may it not ben hid from the pourueyannce of God. And in
this manner this necessite slideth ayeyne into the contrary pertie Ne it
behooves not needs that things betiden that been purueyed. but it behooves
needs that things that been to comen been pourueyed / but as it were
trauailled. As who seyth / thilke answer proceeds right as thaugh men
trauailleden or were besye to enqueren the which thing is cause of which
thing. As whether the prescience is cause of the necessite of things to comen
/ or ellis that the necessite of things to comen is cause of the pourueyance /
But I en^orce me not now to show that the betidinges of things y wiste
biforn^ is necessary / how so or in what manner that the order of causes has
hit self / al th^ugh that it ne seem not that the prescience bring in necessite
of betiding to things to comen / For certes if any wighte sit it behooves by
necessite that the oppynion be sothe of him that coniecteth that he sits.
And ayeinward also hit is of the contrary / For if the opinion be sothe of
any wighte before that he sittith. it behooves by necessi^e that he sit /
then^e is here necessite in that one. and in that other. For in that one is
necessite of si^tyng. And certes in that other is necessite of soth. But
therefore ne sits not a wighte / for that the opinion of sitting is sothe /
but the opinion is rather soth / for a wighte sittith beforn^. And thus tha^gh
that the cause of the sothe comes of that other side / As w^^o seyth. all
t^augh the cause of the ^othe comes of the s^tting and not of the true
opinion. Algates yet there is a com^une necessite in that one and in that
other. Thus suyth hit that I may make semblable skilles of the purueyance of
god and of things to comen / For all thaugh that for the things be to comen.
therefore ben they purueyed / And not certes for they ben purueyed. therefore ne
betide they not. Natheles behooves it by ^ecessite / that either the things to
comen be purueyed of god / or else that the things that been purueyed of god
betiden / and this thing only suffiseth enough to destroy the fredome of our
arbitre. that is to seyne of our fre will / But certes now shows it well how
fer fro the soth. and how vpsodowne is this thing / that we seye that the
betyding of temporal things is cause of eterne prescience / but for to wenen
that god purueyeth. the things to comen for they ben to comen / what other
thing is it but for to wene that thilk things that betiden whilome ben cause
of thilk sovereign purueance that is god. And herto add I yet this thing. that
right as when that I wot / what a thing is / it behooves by necessite that
thilk same thing betide / So follows it then^e. that the betiding of the thing
ywist byforn^. ne may not ben eschued. And at last if any wight wene a thing
to be other wise than it is. It is not only vnscience / but it is full
deceyuable opynion / full diverse and full far from the soth of science /
wherefore if any thing be so to comen / that the betidyng of it ne be not
certain ne necessary. who may weten before that thylke thing is to comen.
For right as science ne may not be meddled with falsenesse. As whoo seith
that if I wot a thing / it ne may not be falls / that I ne wot it / right so
thilke thing that is conceived by science. ne may not ben none other weyes than
as it is conceived. For that is the cause why that science wants leesing. as
who seith / why that wyttyng receives not leesing of that it wot / For it
behooves by necessite that every thing by right as science conprehendeth it ^o
ben / what shall I then^e seyn^. in which manner knows god beforn^ all the
things to comen. if they be not certain / for if that he deem that they be to
come vneschuable / and so may be that it is possible. that they ne shullen not
comen god is deceived / but only to trow that god is deceived. for to speak it
with mouth. it is a felonous syn^e But if that god wot that right so as
things ben to comen so shall they come / so that he wot egaly. as who seith
indifferently that things mowen ben done or else not done What is thilk
prescie^ce that comphendeth no certain thing ne stable. or else what difference
is there between / the prescience of thilk iape worthy dyuinyng of Tyresie
dyuinour that said / All that I see quoth ^e / either it shall be / either it shall

of mankind. If it so be that it demeth the things vncert^in as men done / of
the which domes of men the betiding nys not certain. but if so be that none
uncertain thing ne may not ben in him. that is right certain well of all things
^ then^e (...) the betiding certain of thilk thing which he has wist beforn^
f^rmely to comen / For which it follows that the fredomes of cou^seilles and
of the works of mankind nys noon^ ^ Since that the thought of god which that
sees all things withouten error of falsenesse byndeth and constreyneth hem
to a bytiding by necessite. And if this thing be ones granted and received.
That y^ to said / that there nys no free will / then shows hit well /
how great distruccion. and how great damage there folowen of things of
mankind For in ydel ben there than purposed and bihight medes / to good folk /
and peynes to badde folk. since no meouyng of fre courage voluntarye ne has
naught deserved hem. that is to seye neither mede ne pain. and it should seem
then^e that thilke thing is alder worst / which that is now demed for
aldermoost Just and most rightful. that is to seyne that shrewes ben
punysshed. or else that good folk ben guerdoned. The which folk seen that her
propre will Ne assente hem not. to that one. ne to that other. that is to
seyne. neither to good ne to harm / but constreyned hem certain necessite of
things to comen. than should there never be. ne never weren vice ne virtue / but
it should be confusion of all deserts medeled withouten discrecion / and yet
there follows another inconvenient. of the which there ne may be thought /
no more felonous ne more wik. than hit is / This that so as the order of
things is led and comes of the purueance of god. ne that no thing is
l^ueful to the conseylles of mankind. as who seyth that men han no power to
do no thing / ne wilne nothing / then follows hit that our vices ben
referred to the maker of al good. As who seith. then^e follows it. that god
ought to han all the blame of our vices / since he constreyneth. us by
necessite to done vices. Then is there no reason to hopen in god. ne forto
preyen god. For what should any wight hope to god / or why should he prey to god.
since that the ordena^ce of destenye / which that ne may not be enclind
knitteth and streygneth al things that men may desiren / then^e should there be
done awey thilk only alliance bitwix god and men. that is to seyne to hopen and
to preyen / But by the prys of rightwisnesse and of very meekness we deseruen
the guerdon^ of the dyuine grace which that is inestymable. that is to seyn.
that is so great that it ne may not ben full preysed / And this is only the
manner that is to seyn hope and preyers / For which hit seems that men wol
speak with god. And by reason of supplicaci^n ben conjoined to thilk clerenesse
that is not approached no rather. or that men seken it and impetren^ it. And if
men ne wene not that hope ne prayer^ ne han no strengthes by the necessite of
things to comen y received / what thing is there then^e by which we mow be
conjoined and cliuen to thilk sovereign prince of things. for which it
behooves by necessite that the l^^nage of mankind as thou song a litel here
biforn^ be departed and vnioyned from his well and faillen of his bygynnyng.
That is to seyn^ god

Tum illa vetus inquit. hec est de prouidencit querela Marcoque tullio cum

THen^e said she. This is quoth she the old question of the puruean^ce of god.
and marcus tullius when he distribuyd the dyuinacion / that is to seye. in his
book that he wrote of diuynacions he moeued gree^ly this question. and thou the
self haste sought it much. and utterly and long. But yet ne has it not ben
determined and spedde fermely and dil^gently of any o^ you / And the cause of
this derknes and eke of t^is diff^culte is for that the meouyng of the reason
of mankind ne may not meouen to that is to seye applyen or ioy^en to the
simp^icite of the dyuine prescience / if that men mighten thinken it in any
manner. That is to seyn that if men mighten thinken and comprehenden the things
that god se^th him self / then^e there dwelled utterly no doubt / the which
reason and cause of difficultees I shall assaye at last to show and to speden
when I have first y spended and y answered to thy reasons by which thou art
moeued / for I axe why thou w^nest that thilke reasons of hem that assoillen
thi^ question ne be not spedefull enough ne sufficient the which solticion or
the which reason. for that it demeth that the pscience is not of necessite of
thingis to come As who seyth / any other way than thus. but that thilke
things that the prescience wot biforn^. ne may not vnbetiden / that is to
seyn^ that they moten betide. but then^e if that prescience. ne puts none
necessite to things to comen as thou thy self have confessed it and know a
litel here byforne What cause or what is it / as who seith / there may no cause
be by which that the ends voluntary of thingis myghten be constreyned to
certain betiding. For by grace of posicion so that thou may the better
understand this that follows / I suppose that there ne be no prescience.
Then^e ^xe I quoth she in asmoche as apperteyneth to that. shulden then^e things
that comen of fre will be censtreyned to betiding by necessite / B. Nay quod
I / P. Then^e ayeinward quoth she. I suppose that there be prescience / but that
it ne puts no necessite to things / Then^e trow I that thilk same fredome.
of will shall dwellen al hole / and absolute and vnbou^den. but thou will seyne
that albe it so. that prescience nys not cause of the nec^ssite. of betiding
to things to comen Algates yet it is a sign. that the things ben to betyden
by necessite / By this manner then^e. all thaugh the prescyence han never be.
yet algates. or at lest weye hit is certain thing that ends of betidinges
of things / to comen shulden^ be necessary. For every thing shows and
signyfieth. only what the thing is / but hit ne makes not the thing / that it
signyfieth. For which it behooves. first to show that no thing ne betideth /
that hit ne betideth by necessite / so that it may appear that the prescience
is sign of necessite. or ellis if there ner no necessite / certes thilke
prescience ne might not be sign of thing that nys not. But certes it is now
certain that the prove of this y sustened by stidfaste reason^ ne shall not ben
ladde ne proved by signs ne by Arguments / taken fro without / but by causes
couenable and necessary / but thou may seyne / how may it be that the
things ne betiden not that been purueyed to comen / but certes right as we
trowen. that the things which that the purueance wot beforn^ to comen ne be
not to betiden. But that ne should we not demen^ / but rather all thaugh they
shall betiden / yet ne have they no necessite of her kind to betiden. And
this may thou lightly apperceyuen by this that I shall seyne. For we seen
many things when they been biforn^ our eyen^. right as men seen the Carter
worchyng in the tournyng and in the a^tempering or addressing of his carts or
charryettes and by this manner. As who seith / may thou understand of all
other weakmen^. is there then any necessite. as who seyth in our loking that
constreyneth or conpellith any of thilk things to be done so. B. Nay quod I /
For in ydel and in vein. were all th^ffecte of craft / if that all things
weren meoued by cons^reynyng of our eyes or of our sight. Phi^a. The thinge^
then^e quod she that when that men dene hem / ne han no necessite that men^
done hem eke tho same things / first or they be done. they been^ to comen^
without necessite. For why there been^ sum things to betiden^ of which the
ends and the betidinges of hem been absolute and quyte of al necessite / For
certes I ne trow not that any man^ would seyne this. that the things that men
done now. that they ne were to betiden first er they were dene. And thilke
same things all thaugh men hadden wiste hem beforne. yet they han fre
betidinges / For right as science of things present ne brings in no
necessite to things that men done. right so to the prescience of things to
comen ne brings in none necessite to things to betiden. but thou may said
that of thilk same hit is doubted / as whether that of thilk things that ne
han non^ issues and bitidinges necessaries. if thereof may ben any prescie^ce.
for certes they semen to discorden^ / for thou wenest that if that things ben^
seyne before that necessite follows hem And if necessite failleth hem they ne
might not ben wist before / and that nothing may be comprehended by science.
but certain / And if tho things ne han n^ certain betidinges ben puru^yed as
certain. It should be derknesse of opinion not sothfastnesse of science. and
thou wenest that it be diuerce fro the hoolnesse of science that any man should
deem a thing to be otherwise than it is / it self / and the cause of this
error is. that of all the things that euy wight has know. they wene that tho
things ben know only by the strength and by the nature of the things that been wist or know. and it is all the contrary / for all that ever is know / it
is rather conphended and know. not after his strength and his nature / but
after the faculte. that is to seyne the power and the nature of hem that known
/ and for that this thing should now show by a short ensample the rou^dnes of
a body. otherwise than the sight of the eye knows it / and otherwise the
touching the loking by casting of his bemes waits and sees from a fer all the
body to geder without meouing of it self / but the touching cleueth to the
round body and meoueth about the enuiron^ing and conprehendeth the perties by
rou^dnes / and the man^ him self otherwise beholds him And otherweyes
ymagynacion / and otherwise reason / and otherwise intelligence. For the wit
comprehends with out forth the figure of the body of man^. that is
vnstablisshed / in the matere subject. But the ymagynacion comprehends only
the figure without the matier. reason surmou^teth ymagynacion. and
comprehends by universal loking the com^une speech but the eye of
Intelligence is higher / for it surmou^teth the enuyron^yng of the university
and looks over that by pure subtilite of thought. Thilke same simple form
of man^ that is perdurable in the dyuine thought / in which this ought greatly
to be considered / that the hiest strength forto comprehenden things /
embraseth and conteyneth the lower strength. but the lower strength. ne arises
not in no manner. to the hier strength. for wit ne may comphende nothing out
of mat^er. ne the ymaginaco^n ne looks not the vniusal spieces. ne reason ne
takith not the simple form / so as intelligence takes it / but intelligence
that looks al abouen. when it has comphendeth the form / it knows and
demeth all the things. that been under the form But she knows hem in thilk
manner. in the which it comphendeth thilk same simple form. that ne may never been known of none of that other. that is to seyne to none of tho three
forsaide strengthes of the soul / for it knows the vniusite of reason and the
figure of ymagynaco^n^. and the sensible material. conceived by wit. ne it ne
uses not / ne of reason / ne of ymagynacion^ ne of wit without forth. but hit
beholds al things. so as I shall seye / by a stroke of thought fermely
without discourse of collacion / Certes reason when it lokith any thing universal
it ne uses not of ymagynacion ne wit / and algates yet it comphendeth the
things ymagynable and sensible / for reason is she that diffinissheth the
universal of her conceitt right thus. Man is a reasonable two foted best / and
how so that this knowing is universal. yet nys there no wight that ne wot well /
that a man^ is a thing ymagynable and sensible. and this same considers well
reason. but that nys not by ymagynaco^n nor by wit / but it looks it by
reasonable concepcion. also ymagynacion albe it so that it takes of wit the
begyn^yng to seen and fourmen the figures / Algates al th^ugh that wit ne
were not present / yet it enuyron^eth and comphendeth all things sensible /
not by resoune sensible of demyng / but by reason ymagynatif. sestow not then^e
that all the things in knowing vsen more of her faculte or of her power than
they done of the faculte or power of things that been to known Ne that is no
wrong / for so as every Judgment is the deed or the doing of him that demeth.
It behooves that euy wight perform his werck. and his entencion / not of
foreyne power but of his propre power

Quondam porticus attulit. Obscuros nimium senes Qui sensus et ymagines. E

THen^e the porche / that is to seye agate of the town of Athenes there as
philosophres hadden congregation to dispute / thilk porche brought sometime old
men full derk in her sentences. that is to seyne philosophres that highten
stoicie^s that wend that images and sensibilitees / that is to sey sensible
ymagynaco^ns / or ellis ymagynacions of sensible things. were enprinted into
souls fro bodies withoutforth As who seith thilke stoiciens wenden that the
soul had be naked of him self / as a myrrour or a clean perchemyne so that
all figures mosten first comen fro things frowith out into sowles. and ben
enprynted into souls. right as we ben wont sometime. by a swift poyntel to
fixen lettres enprinted in the smothnesse or in the pleynesse of the table of
wax or in the parchemyne that ne has no figure ne note in it / Blose. But
now argues boece against that opynion and seith thus / But if the thriuyng
soul ne vnplyt^th nothing. that is to seyne. ne does thing by his propre
meouyng. but suffers and lies subgiett / to the figures and to the notes of
bodies without forth / and yeldeth ymag^s ydel evil and vein in the manner of
a myrrour When^es thryueth th^n^^ / or when^es comes thilk knowing in our
soul that discerns and beholds al things. and when^es is thilk strength
that beholds the singular things / or else whennes is the strength ^ that
dyuydeth things yknowe and thilk strength that gadered to geder things
dyuyded and strength that cheseth the ^^trec^aung^d we^e / For sometime it
^^ueth the heed / that is to seye / that it ^^ueth up th^ntencion to right high
things. and sometime it des^endeth into right low things. and when it
retorneth into him self. it reproves and destro^^th the false thingis by the
true things. Certes this strength is cause more efficient. and much more
mighty / to seen and to known things / than thilk cause that suffers and
receives the notes and figures ^^pressed in manner of matier. algates the
passion / that is to say the suffran^ce or the wi^^ in the quyk body goth
before exciting and meouing the strengthes of the thought / right so as when
that clerenesse smyteth the eyes and meoueth hem to seen or right so as voice
or sown hurleth to the eeres. and com^oeueth hem to harken. Then is the
strength of the thought meoued and excited clepeth forth to semblable
meouynges the spaces that it halt with in it self / and adds the spieces to
the nootes. and to things without forth and medeleth the images of things
without forth to things hid within him self

Quod si in corporibus senciendis quamuis ^fliciant instrumenta sensuum

But what is that in bodies to be feled. that is to seye in the taking and in
the knowleching of bodily things And al be it so that the qualitees of bodies
that be ob^ecte fro without forth meouen^ and entalenten the instruments of
the wits / And albe it so that the passion of the body. That is to seyn^ the
wit / or the suffrau^ce goth beforn^ the strength or the worchyng courage /
the which passion^ or suffran^ce clepeth forth the deed of the thought in it
self. and meoueth and exciteth in this mean while the fourmes that resten
within forth / and if that insens^ble bodies as I have said our corages nys
not taught or emprynted by passion to know these things but demeth and
knows of his own strength the passion or suffrannce subject to the body
much more than thoo things / that been absolute and quyte fro all talentes or
affeccions of bodies / as God or his Angeles ne folowen not in decernyng
things obiecte. fro with out forth. But they accomplisshen and speden the
deed of her thought. By this reason then there common many manner of knowinges
to diverse and to differing substances. For the wit of the body / the which
wit is maked and dispoyled of all other knowing. thilk wit comes to
beestes / the which ne mowen not meouen hem self here and there. as oystres
and muskels and other such shelfissh of the sea / that ^leuen and ben norisshed
to roches. But the ymagynacion comes of remuable bestes that semen to han
talent to fleen or to desiren any thing. but reason is all only. the lignage of
mankind right as intelligence is al only the divine nature of which it
follows / that thilk knowing is m^re worth than is other / syn it knows by
his propre nature / not only his subject / as who seith it ne knows not al
only that ap^teyneth proprely to his knowing. ^ut i^ knows the subjects of
al other knowinges. but how shall it then^e be. if that wi^te and ymagynacion
striuen ayein resonyng ^ and said that of thilk universal thing that reason
weneth to seen that it nys right naught / for wit and ymagynacion seyne.
that. that is sensible or ymagynable. it ne may not ben universal. then^e is
there either the Iuggeme^t of reason soth / ne that there ny^ nothing sens^ble.
or else for that reason wot well that many thinghes ben subject to wit and to
ymagynacion. then^e is the concep^o^n of reson^ vain and ^^ls. which that
looks and comphendeth that / that is sensible and singular as universal. and
if that the reson^ would answer ayeinst these two. that is to seye to wit
and ymagynacion / and seye. that sothly she her self that is to seyne reson^.
looks and co^prehendeth by reson^ of vniusalite both that. that is s^nsible /
and that^ that is ymaginable / and thilk two that is to seyne wit and
ymagynacion / ne mowen not stretchen hem self to the knowing of vniuersalite /
for that the knowing of hem ne may not exceden ne furmou^ten the bodily
figures. Certes of the knowing of things men oughten rather yeuen more
credence to the more s^edfaste and to the more profit Iuggement / In this
manner striuyng then^e we that han strength of resonyng and of ymagynyng and of
wit. That is to seye by reason and by ymaginacion / we would rather preyse the
cause of reason. as who seith than the cause of wit and of ymagynacion /
sem^lable thing is it. that the reason of ma^kinde ne w^neth not that the dyuine
intelligence beholds or knows things to come. but right as the reason of
ma^kinde knows hem / for thou arguest thus / that if that it ne seem not to
men that some things han certain betidinges. they ne may not be wist before
certainly to betiden. and then is there no pscience of thilk thi^gis. and if we
trow that pscie^ce be in these thi^gis. then is there nothing that betideth by
necessite. but if we might han the judgment of the dyuine thought as we ben
per^oners of reason. right so as we han demed that it behooves by ymaginaco^n
and wit and bineth reason. right so would we demen that it were rightful thing
that man^es reason ought to submit it self to be byneth the dyuine thought /
for which if we may / as who seith that if we may I counsel that we enhau^ce
us in the heighte of thilk souain intelligence. for there shall reason well seen
that that it ne may not behold in it self. and certes that is thus / in what
manner the pscie^ce of god sees al thingis and diffinissheth al thaugh they han
no certain bitidingis / ne this is non opinion^ / but rather the simp^^cite of
the souain science. that is not shett within no manner of bounds

Therefore then^e as I have showed a litel here biforne that all thing that is
wiste nys not known by his nature propre / but by the nature of hem that
comprehenden hit / late us loken now. in asmoche as it is leueful to us As who
seith. late us look now as we may. which that is the astate of the dyuyne
^ubstaunce. so that we may well know eke what his science is / The com^une
Judgment of al creatures resonables. then^e is that god is eterne. late us
considere then^e / what is eternite. For certes that shall shown us to geder
the dyuine nature and the dyuine science Eternyte then^e is parfite possession.
and al to geder of life intermynable / and that shows the more clearly by the
comparison or collacion of temporal things / For all thing that lives in time
it is present and proceeds fro preteritees into futures / That is to seyne /
from time passed into time coming. ne there nys no thing estabilisshed in time
that may enbrasen to geder all the space of this life / For certes yet ne has
it not taken the time of to morrow. and hit has lost that of yesterday / And
certes in the life of this day. ye ne liuen no more but right as in this
meouable and transitory momente. Then thilke thing that suffers temporal
condition / al thaugh that it never began to be / ne thaugh it never cesse to
be / As Aristotiles demed of the world. And al thaugh the life of it be
stretched with infinite of time / yet algates nys it no such thing as men
might trowen by right that it is eterne. for all thaugh that it comprehend and
embrace the space of the life infinite / yet algates ne embraces it not the
space of the life al to geder / For it ne has not the futures that be not yet.
Ne hit ne has no longer the preterite^ that been done or passed. but thilk
thing then that has and comprehends to gedre all the plente of the life
intermynable. to whom there ne fails naught of the future / and to whom there
nys naught of the preterite escaped or passed thilke same is y witnessed and
proved by right to ben eterne / And it behooves by necessite that thilk thing
be alwey present to him self and competent / As who seith alwey present to him
self and so mighty that all be right at his plesan^ce. and that he have al
present the infinite of the meouable time. wherefore some men trowen wrongfully
that when they heren that it seemed to plato that this world had never
bigyn^yng of time that it never shall han failing. they wene in thilk manner that
this world be maked eterne with his maker. as who se^th they wene that this
world and god be maked to ^^der eterne and that is a wrongful wenyng / for
other thing it i^ to be l^d by the life interminable / as plato granted to
(...) wo^lde / ^ other thing it is to embrace to geder all the presence of the
life that is intermynable which thing is clear and manifes^ to the dyuine
thought ^ ne it ne should not seem to us that god is elder than thingis that been
maked by qua^tite of time / but rather by the prosperity of his simple nature /
for this ilk infinite meouynges of temporal thingis folweth this psenta^y estat
of this life i^meouable and so as it ne may not contrefaiten ne feyne it ne be
euenlik to it for the immoble te / that is to seye that is in the eternite of
god. it fails and fa^leth into meouyng fro the simplicite of the psence of
god and dis^^creasith in the infinite qua^tite of future and pterite And so as
it may not han to geder all the plente o^ the life Algates yet for asmoche as it
cessith neu for to ben in some manner / yet it seems somdele to us that it
follows and resembles / thilk thing that it ne may not atteyne to. ne
fulfillen / and byndeth it self to some manner psence / of this litel momente /
the which psence of this litel and swift momente for that it bears a manner
image or liknes of the ay dwelling of god / It grau^teth to such manner things
as it betideth to / that it seems hem as these things han^ ben / and ben. and
for that the psence of such litel mome^te ne may not dwell Therefore it
rauisshed and took the infinite wey of time. that is to seye by succession /
and by this manner it is done / for that it should continue the life in going. of
the which life hit ne might not. enbrace the plente of dwelling. And for thy
if we woollen putten^ worthy names to things that folowen plato. late us seye
then sothly that god is eterne. and that the world is perpetuell / Then
since every Iuggement knows and comprehends by his own nature things that been subgiett unto him / there is to god al ways an eterne and a presentarye
estate. And the s^yence of him that ouerpassith all temporal momente dwellith
in simplicite of his presence / And enbraceth and considers all the infinite
spaces of times preterites and of times futures. And looks in his simple
knowing all things of preterite / right as they were done presently right now
/ If thou wolt then thinken and auysen the prescience. by which hit knows
all things. thou ne shall not demen hit / as prescience of things to comen /
But thou shall demen more rightfully that hit is science of presence or of
instance. that never ne failleth / for which hit is not cleped preuidence /
but hit should be rather cleped pourueyance which that is estabilisshed full
ferce fro right low things. and from a ferce beholds all things. right as
hit were fro the high heighte of things / Whi axest thou then or whi
disputest thou then that thilke things been done by necessite which that
been y seen and y known by the dyuine sight / Since that forsothe men ne
maken^ not thilke thing necessary which that forsothe men seen y done in her
sight. For adds thy beholding any necessite. to thilke things which that
thou beholdest present. B. Nay quod I. Phi^a. Certes quod she then. if men
myghten maken any digne comparison or collacion of the presence dyuine / and of
the presence of mankind. right so as ye s^ne sum things in this temporal
presence. right so sees God all thing by his et^rne pres^nce. wherefore this
dyuine presence ne chau^g^th not the nature of the proprete of things. but
beholds su^he thinge^ present to him wa^d. as they shulden betyd^n^ to
y^uward in time to comen^. Ne hit ne confounds not the Iugg^mentes of things
but by one sight of his thought he knows the things to comen as well
necessary as not necessary. right so when ye s^ene to ged^^ a man^ walk
on the earth / and the s^nne arisen in the heuene. All be hit so that ye
s^ene to g^d^e that one and that other / Yet nevertheless ye dem^n and decernen
/ that that one is voluntarye. And that other is necessary Right so then
the dyuyne lokyng beholding all t^^nges under him ne troubles not the qualite
of things which that been certeynly present to him ward / But as to the
condicion^ of time forsothe they ben future. For wh^che it follows that this
nys none oppinion but rather a steadfast knowing strengthed by sothenesse. that
when that god knows any thing to be. he ne vnwote not that thilk thing
wants necessite to be / That is to seyne that when god knows any thing to
betide. he wot well that it ne has no necessite to betide / and if thou see
here that thilk thing that god sees to betide / it ne may not vnbetide As who
s^ith it mote betide by necessite / and that thou streigne me to this name of
the necessite / certes I wol well confessen and byknowen a thing of full sad
troth. but vn^eth shall there any wight mowen seen it / or come thereto / but he
be beholder of the dyuine thought. for I wol answeren to the thus / that thilk
thing that is future when it is referred to the dyuine knowing / then^e is it
necessary / but c^rte^ when it is understood in his own^ kind men seen it
utterly fre and absolute fro al necessite. for certes th^r ben two maneres of
necessitees. that oo necessite is simple as thus / that hit behooves by
necessite. that al men be mortal or deedly / An other necessite is co^dicionel.
as thus / if thou wotest that a man^ walks / it behooves by necessi^e that he
walk. thilke thing then^e that any wight has known to be / it ne may not
ben none other than he knows it to be / but this condico^n ne draws not
with her. thilk necessite simple / for certes this necessite condici^nel. the
propre nature of it. ne makith it not / but the adiecco^n of the condition
makes it / for none necessite constreyneth a man^ to gone / that goth by his
propre will / albe it so that when he goth / that it is necessary that he
gooth. right on the same manner then^e. if that the purueance of god sees any
thing psente / then^e mote thilk thing be by necessite. Al thaugh that it have
noon necessite of his own nature / but certes the futures that betiden by
fredome of arbitrie / god sees them all to gedres presents These things
then^e if they be referred to the dyuine sight then^e ben they maked necessary
by the condition of the divine knowing / but certes if thilke things ben
considered by hem self / they ben absolute of necessite / And ne forleten not
ne cessen not of the liberte of her own nature / then^e certes withouten
doubt all the things shulden ben done. which that god wot beforn^. that they
ben to comen / and betiden of free arbitre. or of free will / that albe it so.
that they betiden / yet algates ne lose they not her propre nature in being By
the which. first or they weren done. they hadden power not to han betidde / B
/ Wh^t is this to seyne then quoth I that ^hing^s ne be not necessary by her
propre nature. so that they comen in all manners in the liknesse of necessite /
by co^dicion^ of the dyuine science. Phi^a. This is the difference quod she.
that tho things which that I purposed the a litell here biforne. That is to
seyne the son arising. and the man^ walking. that there whiles that thilk
things ben done / they ne might not ben undone. Natheles that one of hem or it
was done / it behooves by necess^te that it was done. but not that other /
right so it is h^re that the things which that god has present withouten
doubt they shul^en been / but sum of ^em descends of the Nature of things
/ as the son arising. And sum descends of the power of the doers. a^ the
man^ walking / B. then^e said I / no wrong that if these things be referred to
the dyuine knowing. then ben they necessary / And if they ben considered by
hem self / then ben they absolute. fro the bound of necessite. right so as
all things that appears or shows to the witte^. if thou refer hem to
reason. it is universal / And if thou look it / or refer it / to it self.
then^e is it singular. but now if thou seyste thus. that if that it be in my
power to chaungen my purpose. then shall I voyden the purueyannce of God.
when perauenture I shall have changed the things which that he knows
biforne / Philosophia / Then shall I answeren the thus. Certes thou may well
change thy purpose. but for as much as the present ^othnesse of the dyuine
puruean^ce beholds that thou may change thy purpose. and wheder thou
change hit or no And whiderward that thou turn hit / thou ne maiste not
eschew the dyuine prescience. right so thou ne may not flee / the sight of
the present tie / all thaugh that thou turn thy self by thy free will. in
to dyuerce Accions. But thou maiste seyne again to this thus / How shall hit
then be / Shall not the dyuyne science been changed by my disposicion.
when that I woll one thing now / and now another thing. And thilke
prescience ne seems hit not to ^ntrechaunge stonndes of knowing As whoo seyth.
Ne shall hit not semen to us. that the dyuyne prescience entrechaungeth his
dyuerce stonndes of knowing / So that hit know sum time oon^ thing And sum
time yt knows the contrary of that thing Philosophia. No forsooth quod she /
For the dyuine ^ight renneth biforne and sees all the futures and clepeth hem
ay^yne. and retourneth hem to the propre prescience of his propre knowing / Ne
he entrechau^geth not so as thou wen^st the ston^des of his forknowing. as now
this. now that. but he dwelling ay comes beforn^. and enb^aseth at oo stroke /
all^ the mutacions / and this prescience to comprehenden and to seen al
things. God ne has not taken it. ^f the betidinges of things to comen / but
of his propre simplicite / And herby is asso^led thilke things that thou
put a litil here by forn^. That is to seyne that it is unworthy thing to
seen that our futures yeuen cause of the prescience of god. For certes
strength of the dyuine science. which that enbraseth all things / by his
presentarye knowing establissheh man^re to all things / And it ne owes not to
latter things. And since that these things been thus / That is to s^yne that
necessite is not in things by the dyuyne prescience / then is th^re fredome
of arbitre that dwellith hooll and vnwemmede to mortal men / ne the laws ne
pourpos^n. not wicked medes and peynes ^o the willyngis of men that been
vnbou^den and quyte of all necessite. And god beholder and forwi^ter of all
things dwell^th above / And the present eternite / of sight. renneth allewey^
with the diverse qualite of our deeds dyspensing or ordeynyng medes to good men
/ And t^urmentes to wicked men. Ne in ydell ne in vein. n^ been there not
