PAROEMIOLOGIA ANGLO-LATINA In usum Scholarum concinnata. OR PROVERBS English,
and Latin, methodically disposed according to the Commonplace heads, in
ERASMUS his ADAGES.

Very use-full and delightful for all sorts of men, on all occasions.

More especially profitable for SCHOLARS for the attaining Elegancie,
sublimitie, and variety of the best expressions.

The Epistle to the Reader.
Gentle reader.
MY purpose is not here professedly to preface, and discourse unto thee either.
1. What a Proverb is, Paroemia est celebre dictum scita quapiam novitate
insigne. Erasm.
Or 2. What be the properties thereof, Vt celebratum sit, vulgoquejactatum, ut
passim per ora hominum obambulet, a (...). Adagium quasi circumagium. Varro.
Or 3. How it differs from other speech of near affinity thereunto, A
Sententiis, Fabulis, Apophthegmat. viz brevitate, sententia, figura --
Or 4. What Commendation is worthily given to Proverbs Inter bonos autores ut
quisque fuit eruditissimus, eloquentissimusque, ita quamplurimum adagiorum suis
libris aspersit. Quid magno illo Platone (ne dicam divino) (...)? Aristoteles
sicis disputationibus paroemias crebras ceu gemmulas intertexuit.
for their

1. Dignity, diverse learned and famous men having written whole volumes of
them, as Aristotle, Chrysippus, Cleanthes, Plutarch, Theophrastus, Suidas
Plato, King Solomon the gravest senators Romani principes non existimaverunt
inferius esse majestate Imperiali ut magnis de rebus consulti, proverbio
responderent. Divus Hieronymus, Evangelicam sententiam Adagii vulgati
testimonio confirmat. Ne Paulus quidem ipse, dedignatur locis aliquot,
Proverbiorum uti testimoniis. (...). Apollonii ad Euph.
, the greatest Emperors, the inspired penmen of sacred Oracles, and our most
blessed Savior himself choosing, and using them, upon all incidentall
occasions.

2. Antiquity no kind of learning, appearing more ancient. In his ceu symbolis
tota ferme priscorum Philosophia continebatur, proinde pro foribus templorum
veluti digna Diis inscribebantur: passimque columnis ac marmoribus insculpta
visebantur, tanquam immortali digna memoria.


3. Utility, consisting especially in their helpe-fulnesse.

Unto 1. Philosophy Aristoteles apud Synes. existimat nihil aliud esse
paroemias, quam reliquias priscae illius philosophiae, maximis rerum humanarum
cladibus extinctae, subesse velut igniculos quosdam vetustae sapientiae,
ideoque pressius ac penitius inspiciendas-his enim comprehendi quae
Philosophiae principes tot voluminibus tradiderunt.
being relics and fragments thereof, preserved hitherto for their brevitie
Adeo quod in liris intercidit, quod titulis, quod colossis quod marmoribus
servari non potuit, proverbio servatur incolume.
festivitie.


2. Oratorie to persuade. Ipsi etiam philosophi passim suas rations proverbiis
fulciunt. Quid quaeso probabilius quam quod nemo non dicit? quid verisimilius
quam id quod tot aetatum, tot nationum consensus, and v^lut idem suffragium
comprobavit? Inest nimirum in his paroemiis nativa quaedam and genuina vis
veritatis. Deinde fit, nescio quo pacto, ut sententia proverbio quasi vibrata,
feriat acrius auditoris animum and aculeos quosdam cogitationum
relinqueatinfixos. Eras.

Aristoteles ipse in Rhetorices praeceptis paroemias inter testimonia
connumerat, sunt enim quodammodo vel potentiora etiam, quod non causis
accommodata, sed liberis odio and gratia mentibus, ideo tantum dicta factaque,
quia aut honestissima, aut verissima, videantur. Fabius.




3. Ornament, and beautifing of speeck. Si site and in loco intertexantur
adagia, futurum est ut sermo totus, and antiquitatis ceu stellulis quibusdam
luceat, and figurarum arrideat coloribus, and sententiarum niteat gemmulis, and
festivitatis, cupediis blandiatur: denique novitate excitet, brevitate
d^lectet, autoritate persuadeat. Erams.


4. Understanding of the best Authors. Quantum autem gratiam habeant, arguti,
concinni, and breves aphorismi de moribus, and vita juxta decori normam
instituenda, nemo non videt. Grynae.
Haec enim multum offundunt tonebrarum si ignorentur, at rursum lucis plurimum
adferunt si fuerint intellecta: fit enim nonnunquam ut scriptor tacit ad
proverbium alludat, quod si nos fugerit, etiamsi videbitur intellecta
sententia, tamen magna pars voluptatis aberit, ignorata paroemia. -- profuturam
ejus lectionem non modo ad linguarum, and philosophiae cognitionem, fed etiam
ad vitam recte instituendam, and ad legendos cum fructu, optimos quosque
authors.


4. Difficulty, to use Proverbs skilfully, seasonably, and discreetly,
Siquidem ut non medio^ris est artificii gemmulam site includ^re annulo, and
aurum purpurae intertexere: ita non est, mihi creed, cujusvis paroemiam apt,
decenterque orationi inserere. In hujusmodi quemadmodum and in musica, nisi
summum praestes artificem, ridiculu^ fis, and aut laudem eximiam, aut risum
auferas oportet.
Or 5. for the Accommodation of them occasionally how we must apply and use
them, viz. not as meat, but only as sauce, Non ad satietatem, sed ad gratiam
-- nimis crebriter non uteremur, densitas enim earum obstat invicem quo minus
^luceant.
as jewels not fit for to wear every where, in any part of our bodies, but in
our ears, about our necks, etc. in fit places, seasonable times, not set too
thick, for omne nimium Gratiam a^tit quicquid au^ immodicum est, aut
intempestivum: est enim optimarum rerum si minus satietas, certe modus quidam.
(...) etc.

I say, my purpose is not (good Reader) herein to wrong thee so far, nor
famous ERASMUS, Si omne tuli^ punctum qui miscuit utile dulci, omne profecto
punctum in Philologiae comitiis, Diis hominibusque plandentibus, Phaenix ille
Germaniae Des- Erasmus Roterod. editis saepeque locupletatis Adagiorum
Chiliadibus, tulit. Grynae.

Vir ille extra omnem ingenii aleam positus, multorum annorum vigiliis,
judicio, delectuque rerum singulari adhibito -- praedicando ad omnem
posteritatem exemplo.


our worthy (...), as to light thee, with my rush (or candle of thirty to the
pound) after his so bright a torch, Hoc (...) viri incomparabilis beneficium --
Grynaeus -- in his Hesperidum hortis -- certe cum Iliadem illam leporum lego
quae paroemiae vocantur, nunc logothecam Minerva, mihi videre videor; nunc
Mercur^i Salinum quem logium appellant, art eximia fabrefactum, and in qus
tamen ipsomateria cum opificio certet.
but for thy learning and fuller instruction herein, I refer thee to Himself
in the Prolegomena to that right golden-worke of his Chiliads? Nunc Pithus
delicias and condimenta, vel Suadae medullam, interdum visendam quandam,
copiosamque supellectilem longo intervallo promptam, in taberna amplissima
expositam, praedivitis cujusdam institoris, eloquentiae ordine descriptam
digestamque decentissime. Pigmenta atque lenocinia quibus artifices dicendi,
and qui Logodaedali dicuntur, scripta quondam sua vendibiliora reddunt. Budaeus.
I only present thee here with a Sylloge, or Collection of English Proverbs,
marshalled, ranked, and digested under the Heads of his latin Adages,
paralelled with them, and sorted together (as well as I could) all along this
work. In quo proverbia quae veluti consimilis monetae, confiniaque videbantur,
in suam quaeque tribum digessimus. -nec quemadmodum Midae in aurum it^dem nobis
quicquid forte contigissemus, protinus in Adagium verti. Er.


For let me tell thee, that they indeed are not, nor can be all exactly
paralelled to each other all along every head, there being

1. Sometimes many English for one latin, and sometimes again many Latin for
one English: none of which perhaps will aptly answer, or agree to the Latin
sigillatim in special, or proverbiatim one by one, be expressive each to
other: though in general and capitatim they do genuinely, truly and naturally
fall and challenge place, under one and the same Head.

2. Some Proverbs may be applied and used to diverse and sundry senses, and
significations, and so are referred to many and several heads, even by ERASMUS
himself; as Pertusam Dolium to 1. obliviosum. 2. profusum. 3. Avarum. 4.
futilem. 5. Ingratum. A riven dish to 1. forgetful. 2. prodigal. 3. Covetous.
4. blabbing. 5. unthankful. Nihil vetat ^^terdum quo minus idem dictum, ad
complures sensus ^^commodes. Eras.


3. Yea to contrary significations, as if we should say of a notorious liar,
now hear the lip of truth, now you'st hear an oracle.

(...)

4. Under the same head are contrary proverbs placed, as under Impudicitia is
Chaste, etc.

I have gleaned and gathered these Proverbs out of all writers, Nullus est
hodie literator tam trivialis quin si libellum ederet adagia pollicentem,
dignaturus sim eum lectione: quod vere dictum sit, nullum esse librum tam
malum, unde non aliquid boni possis decerpere. nolle legere eos qui tractant
argumentum commune tecum, turpis est arrogantiae; dissimulare cum legeris,
turpioris ambitionis; inficiari beneficium turpissimae ingratitudinis. Erasm.
I could read or meet withal, and have used herein the help of sundry
scholars, and worthy friends: over and beside my own observation of many
golden proverbs, dropping now and then out of vulgar mouths ima de plebe. Hoc
genus scripti constat industria, hinc atque hinc decerpendi.


These Proverbs though excellent in all men's discourse, Oraculorum vim
obtinent. Erasm.
use-full upon all occasions to every man, yet they be chiefly intended for
the use of Grammar-schooles; and therefore the Ethicam, physicam, logisticen,
musicam -- de virtutibus, and vitiis, de vitae humanae conditionibus, de
officiis. --
Industrious Schoolmaster may please, every day to cause his scholars to
repeat a head or two after their Parts, and interpret them; and appose his
scholars therein: or cause one boy in a form to appose and ask another. This
will both teach and reminde them of all learning, history, and antiquity: and
be a synopsis of most use-full and delightful passages in their whole life.
And the benefit hereof will soon be found incredibly great, especially in the
higher forms, useful in all their exercises, Quae in cibo potuque necessaria
esse requirunt, viz ne sit insipidus, immundus, squalidus, Grynaeus. feretque
secum (...), and opulentissimum liberalis, utilisque doctrinae, copiae cornu.
Gryn.
giving luster, as so many orient pearls Cur enim haec ceu thesauros non
numeremus? Erasm.
or rich Diamonds set in gold: for herein is couched and contracted the
quintessence, marrow, ^reame, flower Hoc genus flosculos ac gemmas quibus
eruditi scripta sua consueverunt insignire, plusculum habere gratiae -- Erasm.
and pith of learning, eloquence, and wisdom: our wise forefathers, and the
lear^ed in all ages, briefly ^ransmitting to us in Proverbs, the treasures of
their experience, and knowledge, like gold, much in a little: as the confluence
of light in one Sun, of heat in one fire. Ista non mole sed pretio aestimare
oportet. Quis enim sanus non pluris faciat gemmulas, quamvis perpusillas, quam
saxa quaedam ingentia? In araneo, culiceque majus est naturae miraculum, quam
in Elephanto: it idem in re literaria, non-nunquam plurimum habent ingenii,
quae minima sunt. Erasm.


For the better understanding of some Latin Adages thou must repair ^o
Erasmus his great volume of Adagiorum Chiliades, a book most useful in every
school. Typographica (...) toties renatum. Victurus genium debet habere liber.


The thoughts of thus publishing these, were but late, urged by the
importunity of my stationer, who has printed diverse things of mine, which
have found acceptance above desert Major opinione favor excepit, sive is tuus,
sive operis fuit genius. Erasm. ad D. G. Mountjoy --
or expectation: and so he will needs venture upon this too, which has lien by
me, now these eight years, and been so long in fieri: now it is thine (if thou
please) in facto: for to the Press I manu-mise it, nonum ut prematur in annum.

My earnest request to the Schoolmaster or Reader, who shall make use hereof
is, that they would please, to add, insert, alter, or more aptly place these,
In quo si quis alius anteverterit, nostraque castigarit, huic multam etiam
gratiam habituri sumus, tantum aberit, ut nobis injuriam esse factam
arbitremur: equidem ut probo diligentiam eorum qui id conantur, ita felicitatem
admiror, qui praestare quoque possint in scriptis suis, ne quid momo reliqui
fiat, quod queat carpere: nostra certe m^diocritas, non istud ausit polliceri,
praesertim in hoc argumenti genere. Erasm.
or other occurrent Proverbs, as they shall find occasion: thus diverse have
done to Erasmus himself, Quod argumenti natura sit infinita, ut nihil egerit,
qui hoc agat, ne quid omnino praetermittatur.
where by that work is become so large and complete; and to this purpose
vacant spaces are left under every head, that alterations might be made,
additions inserted. Non minus libenter admoners nos patiemur, juxta parati vel
candide docere quod scimus, vel ingenu^ discere quod ignoramus. Erasm.
This favor if thou will vouchsafe us Palma in medio est, arripiat qui potest.
Erasm.
(courteous Reader) both author and printer shall acknowledge our selves, much
beholden to thee for thy pains herein.
