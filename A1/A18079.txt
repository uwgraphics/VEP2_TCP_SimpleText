A SECOND Admonition to the Parliament.
Jeremy. 26. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. Then spoke the Priests / and the Prophets /
unto the Princes / and to all ye people / saying: this man is worthy to dye:
for he has prophesyed against this City / as ye have heard with your ears.
Then spoke Jeremiah unto all the princes / and to the people / saying: The
Lord has sent me to prophecy against this house / and against this City /
all the things that ye have heard. Therefore now amend your ways and works /
and hear the voice of the Lord your God / that the Lord may repent him of
the plague that he has pronounced against you. As for me / behold / I am in
your hands: do with me as you think good and right. But know ye for
certain / that if you put me to death / ye shall surely bring innocent
blood upon your selves / and upon this City / and upon the inhabitants thereof:
for of a truth the Lord has sent me unto you / to speak all these words in
your cares.

To the godly readers
Grace and peace from God. etc.
THe treatise ensuing (Christian Reader) being in deed purposely meant / as the
title pretends / to be a second Admonition to the Parliament / as yet not
being not dissolved / cannot choose I am sure / but be read of diverse / that are
not of that honorable assembly at this time / so that though the treatise is
principally directed to them / yet the knowledge of ye matters / as it must
needs pass further / so are they ^ese m^t ^s neces^y to ^ther ^own / the^
^h(...)^e^tonly
necessary to be further known / and they are the liker to take good effect /
by means of the general consent of those that like them / and especially by
means of ye faithful prayers / which many good men shall pour forth to God
for his gracious good blessyng therein: wherefore some thing was to be said in a
Preface / as me thought / which might be direc^ed to thee (christian reader)
whosoever thou art / that lightest upon this book to read it. And world to God
many more might read this book then are like / because much worse will be said
against it / by them which shall speak of it by hear say / then could / or
would be said / ^ear^ say^th much ^rt.
if all read it that will speak of it: whereof we have had too much experience
in the former Admonition. But we have cast our accounts which do bend ourselves
to deal in these matters / not only to abide hard words / but hard and
sharp dealings also for our labor / and yet shall we think our labor
w^ll bestowed / it by God his grace / we attain but to thus much / to give
some light of that reformation of religion which is grounded upon Gods book /
and that we ^ould be ^ad to at^yne / ^o by ^is and such ^e books.
somewhat to have opened the deformities of our English reformation / which
hyghly displeases our eternal God. Nevertheless / if it might be / we would
be sorry to offend any / but especially any good Christian man / for our purpose
is not / if we may choose / to ^urchase more hatred / or get us more enenmies /
for undeserved we have of that / and them far too much We have too many enemies
/ too much hatred already undeserved.
already / and to offend the godly man / is far from our meaning / for God
knows we altogether so^ke to do such good. But what is there in our books that
should offend any that be / or would seem to be godly? and yet some man may
say either there is much amiss in our books / or else we have a great deal
of wrong offered us / and that by such men as would seem to be the fathers
of all true godliness / for the authors of the former have been and are hardly
handeled Next doo^ to ha^ging

of no mean estimation it has been said (as is reported) that it had been well

another lykely prelate said / if they were at his orderyng / Newgate should
have been Newgat^ their suer^ and fette^ their ba^d^

law / and I think with the most too / y^ they were close prisoners / they are
found nether to have been traitors nor rebels / and if it had bent tried by Gods
law / they should not have been The authors of t^ former admonition no rebels

former admoni^ion
found to have offended against that law at all / but to have deserved praise
of that law / and of ye church of God / as ryghtly that learned man master
Beza says they deserve / which oppose themselves against such endeavors / as
they do in that little book / far worse then those / which he calls a
manifest falling away from Christ. And I pray the^ gentle Reader mark these
words well of that great learned and godly M. Beza / and it shall answer for
them to two men / principally / that have ernestly declamed against that
admonition / and the authors thereof. The one said ^t was a folyshe book: the
other said the authors were to rash in setting it forth without a council /
and I wot not what allowance before it were de(...)ed. But this learned man
answers them both with one word / that it is a commendable work / and
deserves no disprayse. And whatsoever the declaimer says / they shall be
circumspect enough / that shall auouche undoubted truths out of the scriptures
though they wait not for the consent of a few / no nor yet of many ^icenses ^

/ for master Beza dare say / it is a manifest falling away from Christ to
maintain pluralities of benefices / licenses for non residence. etc. though he
hear not that any counsel has agreed upon it in England / sor he knows it
is a resolved truth in all right reformed churches / and especially in ye
scriptures. And what I pray you have they done amiss / but the declamer also
offended in it / if it be an offense? They have published in Print that the
ministry of England is out of square / and he has published at Paul's cross
/ that the bishops of England have been uncircumspect in making of ministers /
and that has he publyshed before any council in England had determined
^eraduen^re he for^te him ^fe.
it. Would to God he had never done worse fault / nay / would he had not
more offended there / which he craved pardone for / when he had done it / and
yet so / as he said he cared not though they pardoned him not / for he
thinks of like / that he need not care for offending the poor members of
Jesus Christ / and for as much as he spoke against them two in Newgate / he
shall never go to Newgate for saying the bishops were uncircumspect. I could
wish such to be more circumspect what they say to offend simple / and pore
members of Christ. Let such men remember the penalty threatened / better a

need not ask what they have answered to that book / for they have answered

but betray their weakness to the papists / or else confirm them in their
follyes / but principally offend the church of God. And in part / you shall

in the former Admonition / by a short treatise containing a confutation of
their collection or view as they call ^^. The treatise came to our hands /
the author unknown / and we have thought good to unparte it to thee (Christian
reader) that thou might see and consider. But what stand I so much in
defense of y^ former admonition. Some peradventure will think I had need to
speak for this second more. But till I hear more / I will say little. Yet
thus much I say / if some suppose it to be too particular / and to touch the

to this day no translation is so good in England. I will not rip up among our
prelates the symonie / the treachery so particularly as is come to my
knowledge. But those particulars which I have touched / the very occasion
forced me to it / and such just occasion I may have / that I may be more
particulare hereafter. Now / whereas some very improperly (as Vnprope^ applying
of Cham^ examyle. Genesis 9.
I think) do say that we in this do uncover our fathers priuities / and would
with us to forbear so to do. We are of their mind that Cham did naught /
but they shall not find us like that ribaulde Cham / which took delight in that

what we can / to cover this shame with a right cover / that is with a right
reformation / and that do we going backward / as men loathe and sorye to hear
of the nakedness / and desirous to cover it / that our fathers (if they will be
our fathers) may no longer show their shame. Again whereas some men (and that

time / I wish to know wherein? whether in the matters which we handle? or in
the handlyng of the matters? The matters are Gods / wherein we may not minse
him. And the deformities have continued long / and are manifestly intolerable
/ where against we are commanded to cry out. Cry out and cease not / lift up
thy voice like a trumpet / and tell my people their wickedness / and the house
of Jacob their sins / says the Lord to his Prophet / which saying and ye
verse following / does so belong to us / that we shall hardly answer it to God /
if we do the contrary / and scarce well answer it / that we have forborne so
long. And who they be / and what the scripture thinks of them / that require

should speak pleasing things / it is more evident then that I need to
amplify that point. Again / yt they which study and endeavor to please men /
are not the servant of God / Paul's words are plain. Now for the handling
of the matters / whereas some will say such a sentence is too hot / and such
and such a word is too sharp / if they measure our zeal with the zeal of
mild Moises / of Elias / of ye prophets / of John Baptist / of Paul / of the
Apostles / of John the elder against Diotrephes / of Christ our savior against
the Phariseis / I trust they shall find us to keep our selves within the
bounds of the examples of the scriptures. And if they mark our wrytings well
/ they shall find us to have uttered nothing but true / and necessary matter /
and to have framed our words unto our matter / and not to have sought words to
serve our affections. But they which speak sla^derously of them ^ offend not /
o^ those ^ (...) ^n their doing / which call them rebels and seditious / which
are faithful subjects to God and their Prince / which either wrest men's
words / or falsefie them / what deserve they? God forgive them that / and far
worse matters / for his Christ's sake / and give them better minds toward
his true church and a right reformation. And yet for as much as we hear they
will answer us / this I say / if they will keep them to the truth it self /
the word of God / then will the Ioh. 17. 17 A good issue where matters of

matters shortly come to a good issue / but if they draw us to other trials /
there will prove craft in dawbing (as they say) for that has been the craft
of the papists / to rigge up all corners / and to find all the shifts they
can / to have scope enough to vary a lie: to say much nothing to the proof /
and yet to amase ye people with show of authorities. But if they will answer
us still with cruelty and persecution / we will keep our selves out of their
hands / as long as God shall give us leave / and content our selves with
patience / if God suffer us to fall into their hands / and surely we shall
hardly escape them / if they and their doers which be certain persecuting
printers / may have their wills. And here humbly we beseech her majesty /
not to be stirred against us / by such men as An humb^ request to her m^^esti^.

reader) I beseech thee to commend unto God continually in thy earnest prayer.
And thus for this time / desiring thee to pervse this treatise with a single
eye / as also I desire A single eye.

the time that the parliament continues proroged / that they may be well
acquainted with the matters when they come together again: I do commend you and
them / and continually will commend you both / in my earnest prayers unto our
good / and gracious Lord god / to whom in Trinity of persons / and unity of

ever. So be it.

A SECOND admonition to the Parliament.
IT is no new matter to see the faithful and profitable admonitions of God his
preachers currishly rejected of them / which should gladly and thankfully hear
and embrace them / which should obey them / which should to their vttermoste
promote them / which should employ themselves to defend them: and yet it is as
old a custom as it is lamentable / to find such as should be most friends /
most foes. To leave the eldest times / when * Genesis 4. 8.
Abel found no worsse freende then Came / his own brother / when Ismael * Gal.
4. 29.
persecuted Isaac / when Esau * Ge. 27. 41.
Jacob / when Joseph * Ge. 37. 23.
was persecuted by his own brethren / when Moses * Exodus 12. 13. 14.
was fame to flee from Egipte because of the Jews / and so forth till the
time of the Prophets / when * Iere. 26. 8^
Jeremy found least favor at the priests hands / when Ozeah says that Gilead
the * Ose. 6. 8.
college of priests was a city of wicked doers / and polluted with blood /
when Amos was so ill entreated by * Am. 7. 10.
Amazia the priest of Bethel / yea leaving these / and coming nearer / when
our savior Christ cries * Math. 23. 13. 14. etc.
woe to the Scribes and Phariseis / exact intexpreters of God his law /
because of their hypocrisy / who though they would feign seem holy / yet had
they not the hearts to yield to the truth preached by our savior / because
their credit and gain (as they thought) lay another way: they therefore
yielded not / but in steed thereof they slaundered Christ's person / and his
doctrine / they bent themselves wholely against him / they persecuted him / yea
the text is plain / that Phariseis and priests all of them / * Ioh. 11. 47
counseled against him / left him not till they brought him to his death /
nay which is more / one of his own compame / one of the principal / one of
the * mat. 26. 48
twelve / Judas letrayed him. Let us cast our eyes upon the Apostles /
they found not only the Phariseis and priests their masters chief
persecutors / to be theirs also / but diverse * 2. Corinthians. 11. 26.
false brethren / I say brethren / but false brethren / nevertheless they went
and were taken for brethren / these I say they were endanngered by: so then /
to ouerpasse the examples of the church since / as they are reported in the
Ecclesiastical histories (because we have and may have ever best light by the
scriptures) this is it I would say / that in these our days / the preachers
find not less favor / nay they are not more slaundered and persecuted / by
any / then not only by the learned of the popish professyon / but also by
such as would seem pillars of the true religion. And surely a strange thing
it is / and a marvelous case / and much to the dismay of many that it should
be so / saving that in perusing the scriptures / it is found to have been
commonly used. There were two little Treatises lately set forth / both
tending to one end / namely to admonish the parliament / what it had to do
touching religion / and tending to one end / they bear one name / that is /
an Admonition to the parliament. The matters therein contained / how true so
ever they be / have found small favor. The persons that are thought to
have made them / are laid in no worsse prison then Newgate. The men that set
upon them / are no worsse men the Bishops. The name that goes of them / is no
better then rebels / and great words there are / that their danger will
yet prove greater: well / whatsoever is said / or done against them / or
whosoever speak or work against them / that is not the matter: but the
equity of their cause is the matter. And yet this I will say / that the state
shows not it self upright / if it suffer them so to be molested / for that
which was spoken only in the way of admonition to the parliament / which / was
to consider of any such admonition / and to receive it or reiecte it /
without further matter to the Authors: except it contained some wilful
maintenance of manifest rebellion / or treason / which it cannot be proved to
do. Again appealing as they do to that highest Court of Parliament / from
the lower of the Bishops / and Commissioners / because they find not equity
at their hands / nor cannot / the Bishops / who are in their Admonition most
touched / being cheifest in Commission / allege the Parliament what it will
(as some say it was not in form of law / and Imprinted / and yet I trow
there may be found presidentes of the like / as that of Roderike Mors / the
way to Common wealth / the Complaint of the beggars / and such like.) All
honest men shall find lack of equity / if their safety be not provided for
in this respect / yea / and their appeal thought upon / heard / and yielded
unto. If it were the case of any number / for worldly respects / this high
Court were to provide for it / but being the case of the whole church of
England / and Irelande / and in deed God his cause / all good consciences
shall condemn that Court / that provides not for it / but rejects it. The
scripture is plain / it * Math. 10. 14. 15.
shall be easyer for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment / then for such
a Court. God give it grace to provide for it / or ever it be dissolved / and
pardon the negligence already committed / for otherwise surely / there is none
other thing to be looked for / then some speedy vengeance to light upon the
whole land / provide as well as the politic Macheuils of England think they
can / though God do his worste: but shut God out of your assemblies and courts
/ as hitherto in this your last Parliament you have don nothing therein as you
ought / no though you have been solicited / but have suffered them that were
your solicitoures / to be molested / you shall find / both that you ought to
have sought the * Mat. 6. 33
kingdom of God first / and also you shall find / if you consider not your
own ways in your hearts / how you think it a time to build seeled houses
/ to devise laws for the preservation and prosperity of your common wealth /
and neglecte God his church / leave that waste / provide not for that / you
shall find (as the * Ag. 1. 5. 6.
Prophet says) ye shall sow much / and bring in little / ye shall eat /
and not have inoughe. As for the Convocation house / whereof many have
conceived a marvelous opinion / and which should of duty look to these
matters / common experience does prove / that they do for the most part
apply them selves to the time / and seek rather to please and follow worldly
policy / then sincerely to promote Gods cause / and to publishe his truth.
And hereof their last conuocations can be good witnesses. But you say the
Bishops are good men / and great clearkes / they know what they have to do /
and possible some of them do / except the God of this world have bl^nded
their eyes / and so did some of the popish bishops: but you were deceived by
them / and you are like to be deceived by these / if you trust them so far /
as experience teaches. Nevertheless you shall die in * ^ze. 33. 8.
your sins / you shall both * ^at. 15. 14
fall into the ditche. But some will say that the admonition hindered other
things. As who should say that to further Gods cause / is to hinder other
matters that be profitable for the common wealth / does the knowledge of God /
and the promoting of his glory / hinder profitable laws? that is a thing that
I would gladly learn / for I could never understand it before. Wherefore this
may be as a second Admonition / with the like mind as before by them / to
crave redress of the great abuses in our Reformation of Religion / some being
continued from the papists / some devised by the fantastical heads of vain
men / and some though not maintained / yet suffered and not reformed unto
this day / yea and further / as they before / do again appeal to this high
Court of Parliament from all other Courts / being ready to defend that which
I write touching the substance of it against all men / and that upon the
pearill of my life. Let me be but uprightly heard and interpreated. The matter
is Gods / ouerpasse it not lightly / for we may not (though you devised
laws to cut us off / as by some one bishop you have been ere now provoked)
for our parts thus leave it. The other books are short (as it was requisite
to present to you) and therefore they have not so much told you how to
Reform / as what to Reform. They have told you of many things amiss / and
that very truly / they have told you in general / what were to be restored /
but how to do these things / as it is the hardest point / so it requires /
as themselves say / a larger discourse. I mean therefore to supply (as
shortly as I can / because I write as they did to you) some thing that may make
to the expressing of the matter / so plainly / that you may have sufficient
light to proceed by / till they which are endued with greater gifts /
discuss it more exactly / or till we our selves / who have begone / may have
further opportunity to proceed / if it be neglected of their part which could
we it better. And yet this I dare say / for the substance of those Treatises
(which is it that galleth the adversaries most / how so ever they quarrel
with them upon words) that it is so grounded upon the undoubted truth of God
his book / that the devil of hell / cannot with his colors blemishe it /
save he may seek to suppress it by violence: nor any but he / and those whom
he has deceived / or whom God has not yet given so much light unto / will
or can stand against it. I would / and do therefore earnestly admonish them
that know / to know as they ought / and to do as they know / and to beware
of the understand this of the devil / as Ioh. 12. 31 Ih. 14. 30. Ephe. 6. 12
2. Cor. 44. Man. 2. 2. 3 Romans 10. 2
God of this world / that he deceive them not / for the time will come / that
this * dung shall be thrown openly in their faces / to their everlasting shame
/ that maintain it / like as at this day it has befallen to the senseless
Papists / who will never give over / til they can neither will nor choose with
shame enough. Next I would / and do earnestly ad^^onishe those that are
ignorant / to learn to know / and to beware of a blind zeal / which is more
violent and unjust / then ought else / carrying men headlong / to maintain that
/ they have no reason for / and wickedly to gainstand the express truth / to
their endless perdition. Now to the matter / I say that we are so skarce come
to the outward face of a Church rightly reformed / that although some truth
be taught by some preachers / yet no preacher may without great danger of the
laws / utter all truth comprised in the book of God. It is so circumscribed
and wrapped within the compass of such statutes / such penalties / such
inst^uctions / such aduertisements / such articles / such canons / such
sober caueats / and such manifo^^e pamphlets / that in manner it does but
^^epe out from beh^^de the screene. The laws of the land / the book of
common prayer / the Queens Injunctions / the Commissioners aduertisements /
the bishops late Canons / Lindwoodes Proumetais / every bishops Articles in his
d^ocesse / my Lord of Canterburies sober caueates / in his licenses to
preachers / and his high Court of prerogative or grave fatherly faculties /
these together / or the worste of them (as some of them be too badde) may not
be broken or offended against / but with more danger then to offend against
the Bible. To these subscribing / and sub(...)ing again / and the third
subscribing / are re(...)red / for these / Preachers and others are endi(...)
are fined / are priso^ned / are excommunicated / are banished / and have worse
things threatened them: and the Bible / that must have no further s^^pe / then
by these it is assigned. Is this to profess God his word? is this are
formation? He that could not abide strange fire in the old law / but burnt *
Leui. 10. 12
them that used it / what will he do to us in the new law / that erect a new
and strange course / or word / to rule his church by? What did the Pope but
so? he did suffer God his word to have a course as far as it pleased him /
so that he might have the whole authority above it. so did the Popish
church: but we say the * word is above Ephe. 2. 20
the church / then surely it is above the English church / and above all
these books before rehearsed. If it be so / why are not they over ruled (...) /
and not it by them? Here falls forth to be ^^swered a shift of descant to

the trial of the word of God. As well reasoned / it were to say / lay hay or
stubble on the fire / for it will not quench the fire / and therefore it will
not be consumed by the fire / as to say receive this reformation / for it is
not repugnant / therefore it will abide the trial of the word / but the
scripture abides no such distinction of contrary / and diverse / for he that

not pray / even so is it commonly a saying / and reading prayers and not

his knee ache / or his talk ends / or service is done. And why is all this?
but y^ there is no such praying as should touch the heart. And therefore
another has so little feeling of the common prayer / that he brings a book
of his own / and though he sit when they sit / stand when they stand /
kneel when they kneel / he may pause sometime also / but mos^e of all he

CERTAIN Articles, collected and taken (as it is thought) by the Bishops our
of a little book entitled an admonition to the Parliament / with an Answer to
the same. Containing a confirmation of the said Book in short notes.

Esaias. 5. 20. Woe be unto them that speak good of evil / and evil of good /
which put darkness for light / and light for darkness / that put bitter for
sweet and sweet for sower. The Prynter to the Reader.
This work is fynished thanks be to God /
And he only will keep us from the searchers rod.
And though master Day and Toy watch and ward /
We hope the living God is our sauegarde.
Let them seek / look / and do now what they can /
It is but inventions / and policies of man.
But you will marvel where it was fynished /
And you shall know (perchance) when domes day is ended /
Imprinted we know where / and when /
Judge you the place and you can.
