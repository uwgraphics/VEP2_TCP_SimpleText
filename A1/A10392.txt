TO THE MOST NOBLE, MOST MIGHTY, AND MOST redoubted prysnte king HENRY the
VIII. king of England and of France, defensour of the faith* lord of
Ireland, and in earth supreme heed immediately under Christ of the church of
England, his humble servant RYCHARD TAVERNER desires all Joy, felycitie, and
long life.
HOw hyghly all England is bound to your incomparable majesty for the
infinite and manifold benefits received at your most gracious hands from
time to time without ceasing, eue^ from the beginning of your most noble
reign: truly no mortal tongue is hable with words sufficiently to express, or
with secret thoughts of heart worthily to contriue: Certes, it far passes
both the sklender capacity of my wit, and also ye rude infancy of my tongue to
do either the one or the other: yea another Cicero or Demosthenes were not enough
hereunto. Wherefore omitting or rather leauinge to some other the just Encomye
and commendation of your graces most ample deeds, worthy of eternal memory,
yet this one thing I dare full well affirm, that among all your majesty's
deseruinges upon the christen religion (then which surely nothing can be
greater) your highness never did thing more acceptable unto god, more profitable
to ye auau^ceme^t of true christianity, more displeasau^t to the enemies of
the same, and also to your graces enemies then when your majesty lycenced and
wylled the most sacred Bible conteynyng the unspotted and lively word of God
to be in the Englysh tongue set forth to your hyghnes subjects.

To the setting forth whereof (most gracious and most redoubted sovereign
lord) like as certain men have neither vndilige^tly nor yet vnlernedly
traueled: So again it cannot be denied, but yt some faults have escaped their
hades. Neither speak I this to deprave or malign their industry and pains
taken in this behalf: no rather I think them worthy of no little praise and
thanks for the same, considering what great utility and profit has redounded
to your graces hole realm by the publysshyng and setting forth thereof,
although it were not finisshed to the full absolucion and perfection of the
same. For assuredly it is a work of so great difficulty. I mean so
absolutely to translate the hole bible that it be faultlesse, that I fear it
can sca^e be done or one or two persons, but rather requires both a deper
confarrynge of many learned wits together, and also a iuster time and longer
leisure.

Wherefore the premises well considered, forasmoch as ye printers hereof were
very desirous to have this most sacred volume of the bible comforth as fault
less and emendatly, as the shortness of time for the recognizing of ye same
would require, they desired me your most humble serva^t for default of a better
learned, diligently to ouerloke and peruse the hole copy: and in case I should
find any notable default yt neded correction, to amend the same, according to
ye true exe^plars Which thing according to my talent I have gladly done.

These therefore my simple lurubracio^s and labors, to who might I better
dedicate, the^ unto your most excellent and noble majesty, yt only author and
ground next God of this so high a benefit unto your graces people, I mean
that the holy scripture is communicate unto the same.

But now though many faults pchau^ce be yet left behind vncastigat, either for
lack of lerning sufficient to so great an enterprise, for default of leisure.
I trust your majesty and all other yt shall read the same, will pardon me,
considering (as I have already declared) how hard and difficilt a thing it
is, so to set forth this work, as shall be in all points faultles and without
reprehension.

And thus I commit your most gracious and excellent majesty to ye tu^cio^ of
ye highest, to who be al honor, glory, and praise, world without end. AMEN.

An exhortacion to the diligent study of the holy scripture gathered out of
the Bible
Christ unto the people. John^.v. Search the scriptures: for they are they that
testifye of me.

Paul to Timothy, ii. Tim.iii. Al scripture given by inspiracion of God is
profitable to teach, to improve, to amend and to instruct in ryghtousnesse,
that the man of God may be perfect and prepared to al good works.

The same to the Romansxv. What things so ever are written, ^re written for our
learning: that we through patience and comfort of ye scriptures, might have
hope.

Solomon Prou.xxx. All the word of God, is pure and clean it is a shyld unto
them that put their trust in it. Put nothing unto his words, lest he reprove
the, and thou be found a liar.

Moses to the people. Deu.xii. Ye shall not do every man what seems him good
in his own eyes: But what soever I command you that take heed ye do, and
put naught thereunto, neither take ought therefrom.

The Lord unto Joshua. Ios.l. Let not the book of this law depart out of thy
mouth: But record therein day and night, that thou may be circumspecte to
do according to all that is written therein. For then shalt thou make thy
way prosperous, and then shalt thou have understanding. Turn there from
neither to the right hand, ne to the left: that thou may have
understanding in all that thou take in hand.

The same to the people. Exo.xiii. And thou shalt show thy son at that
time, saying: This is done because of that which the Lord did unto me^ when I
came out of Egypt. Therefore it shall be a sign unto the upon thine hand.
and a remembrance between thine eyes, that the Lords law may be in thy
mouth. For with a strong hand the Lord brought the out of Egypt.

Moses Deuteronomy.xxxi. Se that thou read this law before all Israeli in their
ears. Gather the people together: both men, women and children, and the
strangers that are in the cities: that they may hear, learn, and fear the
Lord your God, to keep all the words of this law.

THE CONTENTS OF ALL THE HOLY SCRIPTVRE as well of the old testament as of the
new.
Deuteronomy.vi.i. Tymothe.ii Genesisxvii. Exodusxv. Gene.i. Psa.x. Exodusiii. Ierem.ix.
Roma.ix. Esa.liiii. Hiere.x. Gene.i. Sapi.ii. Roma.v.
First the holy writings of the Bible teach us / that there is one God,
almyghtye, that has neither beginning ne ending: God.
which of his own goodness did create all things: of whom all things
proceed, and without whom is nothing: which is ryghtous and merciful, and
which works al things in all after his will: of whom it may not be demanded
wherefore he does this or that.

Then that this very God did create Adam the first man after his own Image and
lykenes, Creacion of man.
and did ordeyne and appoynte him Lord of all creatures in earth, Which Adam by
the envy of the devil, disobeyinge the commandment of his maker, did first
sin, and brought sin into this world, Ephe.ii.
such and so great, that we which be spronge of him after the flesh, are
subdued unto sin, death, and damnacion, brought under the yoke and tyranny
of the devil.

Gene.iii.xii.xxvi.xxviii. ^bre.ii.
And further, Christ promised.
yt Christ Jesus his son was promised of God the father, to be a sauouyre to
this Adam, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, and the other fathers: which should
deliver them from their sins and tyranny of the devil, whereunto they were
all subject by Adam.

^xodi.xix.xx.
And that in the mean season while the fathers looked for salvation and
delyueraunce promised, because man's nature is such, Law.
that he not only can not, but also will not confess him self to be a sinner,
and specially such a sinner as has need of the sauinge health promised,
Romansiii. Gala.iii.i. Cori.i.
the law was given through which men might know sin, and that they are
sinners when they se they do none of the things that the law commands, with
so glad and willing a mind as God requires: but rather against their
wylles, without affection, and as though they were constrained with the fear
of that hell which the law threatens saying: Curssed be he that mayntayneth
not all the words of this law to keep them. And that this law was given to
thintente that sin and the malice of men's heart being thereby the better
known, men should the more feruentl thryst the coming of Christ, which
should redeem them from their sins.

Luke. ^i. Galathi.iiii. Ephesians.i. Roma.v. Tit.iii.
Last of all: we are taught / that that Christ which was promised and
shadowed in the old testament, is sent of the father, Christ the savior
comes.
at such time as he had determined with him self, at such time (I say) as
all wickedness florysshed. And that he was sent not for any man's good works
(for they all were sinners) but to thintente he would make good his promise and
show the abundant riches of his grace, which he had promised.

John.i. Esaye.iiii.i. Io.ii. Luc.i. Romansv. Ioh.iii.^.vi.
In the new testament therefore it is most evidently declared, that Jesus
Christ the true lamb and hooste, The lamb the sacrifice.
is come to reconcyle us to the father, payinge on the cross the punyshmente
due to our sins: and to deliver us from the bondage of the devil (unto whom
we served through sin) and to make us the sons of God, Peax.
since he has given us the true peax and tranquillity of conscience, that we no
longer do fear the pains of hell: which fear is put away by the faith, Faith.
that the father gives, us drawyng us unto his son. i. Timoth. ^
For that faith is the gift of God whereby we believe yt Christ is come in to
this world to save sinners: which is of so great pith that they which have
it, desire to perform all the duties of love to al men, after the example of
Christ. For faith ones received, God gives his holy ghost, ii. Cor.i. and v.
Ephe.i. Roma.viii.i. Cor.iiii. Gala.v.ii. Cor.v.
wherewith he tokeneth and marcketh all that believe: The holy ghost.
which is the pledge and earnest that we shall surely possess everlasting
life, and that gives witness unto our spirit, and grafteth this faith in us,
that we be the sons of God pourynge therewith the love in to our hertes which
Paul descrybeth and sets out to the Corinthians. Love.
By that faith and confydence in Christ which by love is mighty in operacion,
and that shows it self through the works of love sterynge men thereto,
Justice.
by that (I say) we are iustyfyed: that is, by that faith, Christ's father
(which is become ours also through that Christ our brother) counts us for
ryghtous and for his sons: imputing not our sins unto us through his grace.

To conclude, he came that we being cleansed from our sins, Tit.ii. Luc.i.
Ephe.ii.ii. Pe.i.
and sanctified unto God the father: that is, hallowed unto the use of the
father to exercise good works forsaking the works of the flesh should freely
serve him in rightousnes and holiness al our life long through good works
which God has ordained that we should walk in them declaring our selves thereby
to be surely called unto this grace: Works.
which works whosoever has not, declares yt he has not faith in Christ.

The last judgment.
This is that Christ Jesus which after he has killed the man of sin with
the breath of his mouth, ii. These.ii.ii. Cor.v. Math.xv.
shall sit in his majesty and judge al men, giving unto every one the works of
his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad. And that
shall say unto them that shall be on his right hand. Come ye blessed children of
my father, inherete ye the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the
world: And unto the^ that shall be on his left hand. Depart from me ye
curssed, i Corinta. ^
into everlasting fire: which is prepared for the devil and his angels. Then
shall the end come and he shall deliver up the kingdom to God the father.

Life everlasting.
To the intent we should know this / by the goodness of God workynge by his holy
spirit, are the holy writings of the Bible given us: ii. Pe.i. John.xix.
John.xx.
That we should know (I say) and believe that there is one God, and Jesus
Christ whom he has sent: and that in beleuyng we should have everlasting life
through his name.

An other foundation then this can no man lay. i Cor.iii.
And S. Paul desires that he be holde^ a curssed which preaches any other
faith and salvation, then only by Jesus Christ: though it were an angel of
heaven. Gala.i. Roma.xi.
For of him, and through him, and for him, are al things: to whom, with the
father and the holy ghost, be honor and glory for ever more. AMEN.

These are the generacions of heaven and earth when they were created, in the
time when the Lord God created heaven and earth and all the shrubbes of the
field before they grew in the earth. And all the herbs of the field before
they sprange / for the Lord God had yet sent no rain upon the earth, neither

grows. And the gold of that country is precious / there is found Bidellion
/ and a stone called Onix. The name of the second river is Gihon, which
compasses all the land of Inde.

And the Lord God took Adam, and put him in the garden of pleasure, to dress
it and to keep it. And ^^e Lord God commanded Adam saying: Of all the trees
of the garden eat: But of the tree of knowledge of good and bad eat thou not:
For the same day thou eatest of it, thou shalt dye the death.

And the Lord God said: It is not good that man be a lone / I will make him an
help to bear him company. And after the Lord God had made of the earth all
manner beestes of the field / and all manner fowls of the air, he brought them
unto Adam to se what he would

Then the Lord God cast a slomber on Adam / and he slepte. And he took out one

the Lord God made of the rybbe which he took out of Adam Eccl.vii. a 1.

woman saw that it was a good tree to eat of, and fair unto the eyes / and a
pleasant tree for to give understanding. And took of the fruit of it and are,
and gave unto her husband also / and he ate. And the eyes of both them were
opened / that they understood they were naked. Then they sowed fygge leaves

hid my self. And he said: who told the that thou were naked? have thou
eaten of the tree, of which I bad the that thou sholdest not eat? And Adam
answered: The woman which thou gave me

And the Lord God said unto the serpent: because thou haste done this, cursed
be thou above all cattle and beasts of the earth: upon thy belie shalt thou
go: and earth shalt thou eat all days of thy life. I will put enmytie

And unto the woman he said: I will increase thy sorrows / and make the often

the power of thy husband, / and he shall rule the.

And unto Adam he said: Because thou have obeyed the voice of thy wife / and
eaten of the tree of which I commanded the not to eat: Cursed be the earth in
thy work. In sorrow shalt thou eat thereof all days of thy life: And it shall
bear thorns and thystels unto the. And thou shalt eat the herbs of the

And Adam called his wife Eve / because she was the mother of all that lives.
And the Lord God made Adam and his wife garments of skynnes / which he put on
them. And the Lord god said: Lo, Adam is become as one of us in knowledge of
good and evil. But now leest he stretche forth his hand, and take also of the
tree of life, and eat and live ever. Then the Lord God cast him out of the
garden of pleasure / to tylle the earth whence he was taken. And he cast Adam
out / and did set at the entering of the garden of pleasure Cherubin with a

laugh at me. She said also: who would have said unto Abraham, that Sara should
have given children suck / or that I should have borne him a son in his old
age: The child grew, and was weaned / and Abraham made a great feast the
same day that Isaac was weaned. Sara saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian

Then said the servant unto him: what if the woman will not agree to come

thou came out of? And Abraham said unto him: beware of that, that thou

the Lord has blessed my master out of measure, so that he is become great,
and has given him sheep, oxen, silver and gold, menseruauntes,

And Isaac made intercession unto the Lord for his wife: because she was

Jacob answered and said to Laban: I departed Racheles polecye.

come upon me. So searched he, but found them not.

Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban. Jacob also answered and said to him:
what have I trespased, or what have I offended, that thou folowedeste after me?
Thou haste searched all my stuff, and what haste thou found of all thy
household stuff? put it here before thy brethren and mine, and let them judge
between us both. This.xx. year that I have been with the, thy sheep and thy
gootes have not been baren, and the rams of thy flock, have I not eaten.
What so ever was torn of beast is, I brought it not unto the, but made it good

Laban answered and said unto Jacob: the daughters are my daughters, and the
children are my children, and the sheep, are my sheep, and all that thou seyst
is mine. And what can I do this day, unto these my daughters, or unto their
children which they have borne? Now therefore come on, let us make a bond, I
and thou together, and let it be a witness between the and me. Then took Jacob
a stone and set it up for a pyler and mark stone, and said unto his brethren,
gather stones. And they took stones, and made an heap, and they ate there upon
the heap. And Laban called it Iegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Gilead,

tarried all night in the hill. And early in the morning Laban rose up and kyssed
his children and his daughters, and blessed them and departed and went unto his

him circumcyse all that be males, and then let him come and observe it, and be
taken as one that is borne in the land. No uncircumcised person shall eat
thereof. One manner of law shall be unto them that are borne in the land / and

And Moses said to Aaron: Say to all the Quayles.
And at even the quayles came and covered the ground where they lay: And in

And when the dew was fallen, behold it lay upon the ground in the
wilderness small and round and thyn as the hoar frost on the ground. When
the children of Israel saw it, they said one to an other what is this? For they
wist not what it was. And Moses said: i. Corin.x. ^
this is the breed which the Lord has given you to eat. This is the thing
which the Lord has commanded that ye gather every man enough for him to
eat: a gomer full for a man according to the nombre of you, Manna.
and gather every man for them which are in his tente.

And the children of Israel did so / and gathered some more, some less, and
did mete it with a gomer. ii Corinth.viii.c
And to him that gathered much was no superfluity, and to him that had
gathered little, was no lack but every man had gathered suffycyent for his
eating. And Moses said to them: se that no man let ought remain of it till
the morning. Notwithstanding they obeyed not Moses: but some of them left of
it till morning, and it waxte full of worms and stanke / and Moses was angry
with them.

And they gathered it all mornings: every man as much as suffysed for his
eating / for as soon as the Ge^.xviii. a.

breed, that is to wit, two gomers for one man / and the rulers of the
multitude came and told Moses. And he said unto them, this is that which the
Lord has said: tomorowe

Notwithstanding there went out of the people in the.vij. day to gather, but
they found none. Then the Lord said to Moses: how long shall it be ere ye will
keep my commandments and laws? Ezech.xx. b
Se, because the Lord has given you a Saboth, therefore he gives you the sixth
day breed for two days. Abide therefore every man at home, and let no man go
out of his place the.vij. day. And the people Nume.xi. b
And it was like unto Coryander seed, and white / and the taste of it was like

And Moses said: this is that the Lord commands, fill a Gomor of it that
it may be kept for your children after you, that they may se the breed wherewith
he fed you in wilderness, when he had brought you out of the land of Egypt.
And Moses said unto Aaron: take a cruse, and put a Gomer full of Man therein /
and lay it up before the Lord to be kept for your children after you, as the
Lord commanded Moses. And Aaron laid it up before the testimony there to be
kept. ii. Esd.ix. d Judith.v.c
And the children of Israel are Man.xl. year until they came to a land

mountain, saying / thus say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of
Israel: ye have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I took you up upon
egles wings, and have brought you unto my self. Now therefore if ye will hear

for all the earth is mine. Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy
people, i. Petter.ii. b
these are the words which thou shalt say unto the children of Israel.

And Moses came and called for the elders of Israel, and laid before them all
these words, which the Lord had commanded him. And the people answered all
together and said: All that the Lord has said, we will do. And Moses
brought the words of the people unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto
Moses: Lo, I will come unto the in a thick cloud, that the people may hear
when I talk with the, and also bileue the for ever. So Moses showed the words
of the people unto the Lord.

And the Lord said unto Moses: God The wosshynge of the clothes is but a
monicion to puryfye the hearts.
and let them ph wasshe their clothes, that they may be redye against the

And mount Sinai was al-togyther on a smoke: because the Lord descended down
upon it in fire. And the smoke thereof ascended up, as it had been the smoke of a

brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become.

And Aaron said unto them: pluck of the golden earynges, which are in the
ears of your wives, your sons and of your daughters: and bring them unto
me. And all the people plucked of the golden earynges, that were in their
ears, and brought them unto Aaron. And he ^salm.iv. ^

Then Moses besought the Lord his God and said: O Lord, Why should thy wrath
wax hot upon thy people which thou haste brought out of the land of Egypt
with great power and with a mighty hand? ^^ut.xiiii. e
wherefore should the Egypcians speak and say: For a myschefe did he bring
them out: even to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the
face of the earth? Turn from thy fearse wrath, and have compassion over ye
wickedness of thy people. Remember Abraham, ^^n.xlviii. ^.xv. b ^ii. a
I will multiplye your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land
which I have said, I will give unto your seed: and they shall enheret it for
ever. And the Lord refrayned him self from that evil, which he said he
would do unto his people.

And Moses turned his back, and went down from the hill, and the two tables
of witness in his hand: which were written on both the leaves, and were the
work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.
And when Joshua herd the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto
Moses: there is a noise of war in the host. And he said: it is not the cry
of them that have the mastrye, nor of the^ that have the worse: but I do hear
the noise of singing.

And as soon as he came nyghe unto the host

And Aaron said: let not the wrath of my Lord wax fearse, thou knoweste the
people that they are even set on myschefe: they said unto me: Make us a God to
go before us, for we wot not what is become of Moses thy fellow, that brought
us out of the land of Egypt. And I said unto them: Let them that have gold,
take and bring it me: And I cast it into the fire, and thereof came out this
calfe.

When Moses saw that the people were Nu.xxv. a
Put every man his swerd by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate
through out the host: and slay every man his brother, every man his friend, and
every man his neighbor. And the children of Leui did as Moses had said. i.
Corin.x. b
And there were slain of the people the same day, about three thousand men.
Then Moses said: fill your hands unto the Lord this day, every man upon his
son and upon his brother: to bring upon you a blessing this day.

And on the morrow, Moses said unto the people: Ye have sinned a great sin.
But now I will goo up unto the Lord, to wit whyther I can make an atonement
for your sin.

And Moses went again unto the Lord, and said: Oh, this people have sinned a
great sin, and have made them a god of gold: yet forgive them their sin I
pray the: If not To wype him out of ye book, is to put him out of the no^bre

their sin is to have their synn in remembrance to ponyshe it: as in
Genesis.l. d
vyset their sin upon them. And the Lord plaged the people, because they
made the calfe which Aaron made.

The Lord sends an angel before his people. The Lord denies to go up with
the people. The people lament their sin. Moses talks with the Lord and
desires to se his face: and is commanded to stand upon the rock. CAP.

ANd the Lord said unto Moses: depart and go hence: both thou and the people
which thou have brought out of Exo.xxiii.c
And I will send an angel before the, and will cast out the Cananytes, the
Amorytes, the Hethites, the Pherezites, the Heuites, and the Iebusytes: that
thou may go into a land that flows with milk and honye. But I will not
go among you my self, for ye are a slyfenecked people: lest I consume you by
the way. And when the people herd this evil tydinges, they sorowed: and no
man did put on his best raiment.

And the Lord spoke unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel: ye are a
slytenecked people: I must come once suddenly upon you, and make an end of you.
But now put your goodly raiment from you, that I may wete what to do unto you.
And the children of Israel laid their goodly raiment from them even under
the mount Horeb.



And the Lord spoke unto Moses To se God, or to speak to God, face to face,
is: to have a manifest and a sure knowledge of him as in Gene.xxxii. g.
face to face, as a man speaks unto his trende. And when Moses turned again
into the host, the lad Joshua his servant the son of Nun departed not out of
the tabernacle. And Moses said unto the Lord: Se, thou saydest unto me: Lead
this people forth, but thou show me not whom thou will send with me.

And he said: my presence shall go with ye, and I will give the rest. And he
said: If thy presence go not with me, carry us not hence for how shall it be
known now that both I and thy people have found favor in thy sight, but in
that thou go with us: that both I and thy people have a preminence before
all the people that are upon the face of the earth. And the Lord said unto
Moses: I will do this also that thou haste said, for thou haste found grace
in my syghte, and I know the by name.

shoulder unto his part, for the wauebrest and the heueshoulder I have taken of
the children of Israel, even of their peaxofferynges, and have given it unto

remains of the flesh and of the breed, burn it with fire.

And se ye depart not from the door of the tabernacle of witness seven days
long, till the days of your fulofferynges be at an end. For seven days
must your hands be filled, as they were this day: even so the Lord has
commanded to do, to the intent to reconcyle you. Se therefore ye abide in the

holy. If it be any manner of unclean beast of which men may not offer unto the
Lord, let him bring the beast before the preast and let the preast value it.
And whether it be good or bad as the preast sets it, so shall it be. And if

If he that sanctified the field will redeem it again, let him put the fyfte

Notwithstanding no dedycated thing ye a man dedycateth unto the Lord, of
all his good, whether it be man or beast or land of his enheritaunce, shall be

dedicate thing therefore that is dedicate of man, may be redeemed, but must

All these tithes of the land, whether it be of the corn of the field or
fruit of the trees, shall be holy unto the Lord. If any man will redeem ought of
his tithes, let him add the fyfte part more thereto. And the tithes of oxe^

tithes unto the Lord. Men shall not look if it be good or bad nor shall change
it. If any man change it then both it and that it was changed withal, shall be
holy and may not be redeemed. These are the commandments which the Lord gave
Moses in charge to give unto the children of Israel in mount Sinai.

If it chaunsed that the cloud abode any space of time upon the habitacion,

they iourneyed. Whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken
up, they iourneyed. But when the cloud tarried two days, or a month, or a
long season upon the habytacyon, as long as it tarried thereon, the children of
Israel kept their tents, and iourneyed not. And as soon as the cloud was
taken up they iourneyed. At the mouth of the Lord they rested, and at the
commandment of the Lord they iourneyed. And thus they kept the watch of

Escol, and they cut down there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and bare
it upon a staff bitwene twain, and also of the pomegranates, and of the

also gyauntes, the children of Enacke which are of the gyauntes. And we seemed

If the Lord have lust to us, he will bring us in to this land, and give it
us, which is a land that flows with milk and honye. But in any wise rebel
not against the Lord. More over fear ye not the people of the land, for even

And all the people bade stone them with stones. But the glory of the Lord

When Moses herd it, he fell upon his face and spoke unto Corah and unto all

answered, we will not come. Seems it a small thing unto the that thou have

brought us unto no land that flows with milk and honey, neither haste given

these men? we will not come.

And Moses waxed very angrye and said
Turn not unto their offringes. I have not taken so much as an ass from
them, neither have vexed any of them. Then Moses said unto Corah: Be thou and
all thy company before the Lord: both thou they and Aaron to morrow. And
take every man his ce^ser and put cens in them, and come before the Lord
every man with his censer: two hundred and fyftye censers, and Aaron with his
censer. And they took every man his censer and put fire in them and laid cens
thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of witness, and Moses and
Aaron also. And Corah gathered all the congregation against them unto the
door of the tabernacle of witness.

And the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the congregation. And the Lord
spoke unto Moses and Aaron, saying: sever your selves from this congregation,
that I may consume them at once. And they fell upon their faces, and said. Nu^

elders of Israel followed him. And he spoke unto the congregation, saying:
depart from the tents of these ungodly men, and touch nothing of theirs:
least ye perysshe in all their sins. And they gat them from the tents of
Corah, Dathan and Abiram on every side. And Dathan and Abiram came out and

And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying: Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron

fire here and there, for the censers of these sinners are hallowed in their
deaths: and let them be beaten into thynne plates and fastened upon the

they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.

And Eleazar the preast took the brazen censers,

And on the morrow all the multitude of ye children of Israel murmured against

peradventure I might be hable to smite them, and to drive them out of the
land. For I wot that whom thou blessest, shall be blessed, and whom thou
cursest shall be cursed.

And the elders of Moab went with the elders of Madian, having the reward of
the sothesayenge in their hands. So they came unto Balam and told him the

So Balam rose up in the morning and said unto the lords of Balac: Get you
unto your land, for the Lord will not suffer me to go with you. And the
lords of Moab rose up and went unto Balac and said. Balam would not come with

they. And they came to Balam and told him: Thus says Balac the son of Ziphor
Oh, let nothing let the, to come unto me, for I will hyghly auau^ce the unto

And Balam arose up early, and fadled his ass, and went with the Lords of

And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord stand in the way and his
sword drawn in his hand, she turned a side out of the way, and went out
into the field. And Balam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.

And the angel of the Lord went and stood the Ass, and she said unto
Balam: What have I done unto the, Balams ass speaks.
that thou smyteste me thus three times? And Balam said unto the Ass: because
thou have mocked me? I would that I had a sword in mine hand, that I might
now kill the. And the Ass said unto Balam: am not I thine Ass which thou

And the Lord opened the eyes of Balam, that he saw the angel of the Lord
standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand. And he bowed him
self and fell flat on his face. And the angel of the Lord said unto him:
Wherefore smytest thou thine ass thus three times? Behold I came out to resist
the, for thy way is froward and contrary unto me, and the Ass saw me and
avoided me three times: or else (had she not turned from me) I had surely
slain the and saved her alive. And Balam said unto the angel of the Lord:
I have sinned: for I wist not that thou stodest in the way against me. Now
therefore if it displease thine eyes, I will turn again. And the angel said
unto Balam, go with the men: but in any wise, what I say unto the, that say.

did fet the to curse mine enemies: and behold thou blessest them. And he
answered and said: must I not keep that and speak it, which ye Lord has
put in my mouth? And Balac said unto him: Come I pray the with me unto an
other place whence thou shalt se the^ and shall se but the vttermoste part of

And he took up his parable and said: rise up Balac and hear, and harken unto
me thou son of Ziphor. The Lord is not a man,
ye he can lie, neither the son of man, that he can repent: should he say
and not do, or should he speak and not make it good? Behold, I have begone to
bless and have blessed, and can not go back therfro. He beheld no
wickedness in Jacob nor saw Ydolatrye in Israel: The Lord his God is with

answered and said unto Balac / told not I the saying / all that the Lord
byddeth me, that I must do? And Balac said unto Balam / come I pray the, I
will bring the yet unto an other place / so peradventure it shall please God
that thou may curse them there. And Balac brought Balam unto the top of
Peor, that boweth toward the wilderness. And Balam said unto Balac / make me
here.vij. altares, and prepare me here.vij. bullockes and vij. Rams. And
Balac did as Balam had said, and offered a bullock and a Ram on every altar.

Lord, God of their fathers which he made with them when he brought them out

worshypped them: gods which they knew not, and which had given them
naught. And therefore the wrath of the Lord waxed hoote upon that land to
bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book. And the Lord cast
them out of their land in anger, wrath, and great furyousnesse, and cast them

Lords host said unto Joshua, Exodusiii. b Actuum.vii. b

Joshua did so.

sound of the horn, let all the people shoute a mighty shoute. And then shall
the walls of the city fall down, and the people shall a^eno, every man
straight before him.

And Joshua the son of Nun, called the priests and said unto him: take up the
arcke of the appointment, and set seven priests bear seven trompettes of
rams horns before the arcke of the Lord. And he said unto the people, go
and compass the ci^ye, and let the men of arms go before the arcke of the
Lord.

And so the arcke of the Lord compased the city, and went about it ones: and
then they returned in to the host and lodged there. And Joshua arose earlye in
the morning, and the priests took up the arcke of the Lord, and seven
priests bare seven trompettes of rams horns before the arcke of the Lord,
and as they went blewe the horns. And the men of arms went before them and
the common people came after the arcke of the Lord, and as they went, they
blewe the horns. And the second day they compassed the city ones, and
returned again in to the host, and so they did six days.

And the seventh day they rose early: even with the dawning of the day, and
compased the city after the same manner seven times.

And at the seventh time the priests blewe the horns, and Joshua said unto
the people, shoute, for the Lord has given you the city. But the city shall
be cursed, both it and all Io^^

nothing at all, that is forbid you, leest ye be found transgressoures, and
cause all the host of Israel to be under curse and mysfortune. But the silver,
gold, vessels of brass and iron, shall be holy unto the Lord, and shall go
in to his treasury.

And the people cried, and blewe with horns: for when the people herd the
sound of the horns, they shouted a great shoute: and the (...) Ie^^let^.
walls fell down, and the people went up in to the city, every man forth
right, and took the city. And they utterly destroyed all that was in the
city, both man and woman, young and old, ox, sheep and ass, with ye edge
of the sword.

Then Joshua said unto the two men that went to espy out the country: (...)

And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein. Only the silver,
the gold, and the things of brass and iron, they put unto the treasure of

And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot, her fathers household, and all that
pertayned unto her, and she dwelt in Israel eue^ unto this day, because she hyd

And Joshua cursed at that time, saying: Cursed be the man before the Lord,
that ryseth up, and buyldeth this city Jericho: so that he lay the foundation
with the death of his eldest son, and with the death of his youngest, set up
the gates. And the Lord was with Joshua, and his fame was herd, through out
all lands.

Acan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zarch, of the trybe

against the children of Israel.

Then Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethauen, on the
east tide or Bethel, and spoke unto them, saying / get you up, and vewe the
country. And the men went up and spyed out Ai, and returned unto Joshua, and
said unto him, let not the people goo up, but let as it were two or three
thousand men goo up and destroy Ai, and make not all the people to labor
thither, for they are but few.

And so there went up thither about a three thousand men, which fled
before the men of Ai. And the men of Ai smote of them upon a thirty and six
men, and chased them before the gates, even unto Gabarim, and smote them down
the way. And the hertes of the people, were discouraged and melted

And Joshua said: Ah, Lord almyghtye wherefore have thou brought this people
over Jordan, to deliver us in to the hands of the Amorytes to destroy us:
Would God that as we began, so we had adventured and dwelte on the other side
Jordan. Oh Lord what shall I say, when Israel turns their backs before
their enemies. Moreover the Canaanytes, and all the inhabitants of the land,
shall hear it / and shall come about us, and destroy the name of us out of
the world. And then what will thou do unto thy mighty name.

And the Lord said unto Joshua, get the up wherefore lie thou thus upon thy
face? Israel has sinned, and also transgressed mine appointment which I
commanded them, and have taken of the cursed things, and have stolen and hyd
them among their own stuff. And therefore the children of Israel can not
stand before their enemies. They shall turn their backs before their
enemies, because they be cursed. Neither will I be with you any more, except
ye destroy the cursed among you.

^^od.xx. a
sanctifye the people, and bydde them sanctifye them selves against the
morrow: for so says the Lord God of Israel, the curse is among you Israel,
and therefore ye can not stand before your enemies, till ye have put to death
him that has taken of the damned spoils, among you. To morrow morning ye
shall come by your tribes. And the trybe which the Lord shall find gyltye,
shall come by kynredes. And the kynrede which the Lord shall find giltye,
shall come by housholdes. And the household which the Lord shall find fautye,
shall come man by man. And he that is found in the curse, shall be burnte with
fire, both he and all his goods, because he has transgressed the covenant of
the Lord, and because he has w^oughte folly in Israel.

And so Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel by their
trybes: and the tribe of Judah was attached. Then he brought the kynredes of
Judah, and found the kynred of the Zarehites gyltie. And he brought the kynred
of the Zarehites by householders, and Zabdi was caught. And he brought his
household man by man, and Acan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the
son of Zareh, in the trybe of Judah was found gylty.

And then Joshua sent messengers which ran unto the tent. And behold, it was

And Joshua took Acan the son of Zareh, and the silver, and the garment, and
the rule of gold, and his sons and his daughters, his oxen, asses, sheep,
his tente, and all that he had, and all Israel with him, and brought them
unto the valeye of Acor.

And Joshua said: forasmoche as thou have troubled us: the Lord shall trouble
the this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, Aca^ is stoned
and burnt all that be had with fire. And they cast upon him a great heap of
stones that remains unto this day. And so the Lord turned from his fearce
wrath. Wherefore the name of the place is called the valeye of Acor unto this

Then the Lord said unto Joshua reach out the spear that is in thyn hand

And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Ruben, to the children

house a lord, through out all the trybes of Israel, which heads of their
fathers housholdes were over the thousands of Israel. And they went unto the
children of Ruben, of Gad, and to the half trybe of Manasses, unto the land
of Galaad, and spoke with them saying.

what tra^sgression is this that ye have transgressed against the God of

land of your possession be unclean, then come over unto the land of the
possession of the Lord, where the Lords tabernacle dwells, and be possessed
among us. But rebel not against the Lord, nor against us, to build you
any other altar, save the altar of the Lord our God. Did not Acan the
son of Zareh transgress the commandment of the Lord, and wrath fell on
all the congregation of Israel, so that he alone perysshed not for his
wickedness?



Or else if we have buylte us an altar to turn from following the Lord, or
to offer thereon bu^^^ ^^^rynge or meat off^^^^ges, or to offer peax offerynges
thereon, set the Lord require it: And have not rather done it for fear of
this, leest in time to come your children should say unto ours: What have
ye to do with the Lord God of Israel, seeing that the Lord has made Jordan
a border between us and you ye children of Ruben and of Gad: ye have no part
therefore in the Lord / and so shall your children make our thyldren cease
from fearing the Lord.

And we thought, if they should so say to us, or to our generacions in time
to come, that we would say again: Behold the facyon of the altar which
our fathers made, neither for burnt offerynges, nor sacrifyces, but that it
should be a witness between us and you. God forbid that we should rebel
against the Lord, and that we should turn this day from after him, and
build an altar for burnt offerynges or sacrifices, save the altar of the
Lord our God that is before his tabernacle.

And when Phinehes the Preeste and the Lords of the congregacyon, and heads

And Phinehes the son of Eleazar the Preeste said unto the children of

And Phinehes the son of Eleazar the Preeste and the Lords returned from
the children of Ruben and of Gad out of the land of Galaad unto the land of
Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again. And the
answer pleased the children of Israel well, and they praised God, and did not
intend to goo against them in battle, to destroy the land which the
children of Ruben and Gad dwelte in. And the children of Ruben and the children
of Gad called the altar After the Hebrew. The common translacio^ our witness

Then Judah said unto Simeon for the trybe of Simeon.
Simeon his brother: come with me in to my lot, and let us fight against the
Canaanites. And I likewise will go with the in to thy lot. And so Simeon went
with him.

And Judah went up, and the Lord delivered the Canaanytes and the Pheresites in

even to fight against the Canaanytes that dwelte in the mountain, in the

give Acsah my daughter to wife. And Othoniel the son of Kenez Calebs younger
brother took it: to whom he gave Acsah his daughter to wife, and as they went
her husband counseyled her to ask of her father a field.

And then she lyghted of her ass: and Caleb said unto her: What ayleth the?
She said unto him: give me a blessing, for thou have given me a Southwarde

dwelt among them. But as soon as Israel was waxed mighty, they put the
Canaanites to trybute, but expelled them not.

In like manner Ephraim expelled not the Canaanites that dwelt in Gazer, (...)
but the Canaanites dwelt still in Gazer among them.

Neither did Zabulon expel the enhabitours of Ketron, neither the enhabitours

trybutaryes unto them.

And the Amorites kept the children of Dan in the mountayns, and suffered them
not to come down to the valeyes. And so the Amorytes went to and dwelled in
mount Here Is that is to say a witness in Hailon and in Galabim. Neuerthelater

And even so now, if ye have done truly and Grek.upon

Abimelech priuelye, saying: Behold Gaal the son of Obed and his brethren be

And Abimelech and the companyes that were with him, ran and stood in the

the people that were in the feldes and five them. And then Abimelech fought
against the city all that day, and took it, and slew the people that was
therein, and destroyed the city and sowed salt in the place. And when all the
men of the tower of Siche^ herd that, they entered in to a strong hold of
the house of their God Baal Berith, when they made a conuenaunt to him and the
place had Berythes name and was strongly fensed.

And when it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Sichem, were
gathered together, he gat him to mount Zelmon, both he and all that were with
him, and took a^es with him and cut down an arm of a tree, and took it up,
and put it on his shoulder, and said unto the folcke that were with him, what

Then went Abimelech to Thebez and beseged it, and took it. But there was a
strong tower in the mids of the city, and thither ran all the men and women,
and all the cytezens of the city, and shut it to them, and got them upon the

idle people and robbars assembled them selves to Iephthah, and went out with

against Israel, then the elders of Galaad went and fet Iephthah out of the

because Israel took away my land, when they came forth of Egypt: even
from Arnon: unto Iabok, and from thence unto Jordan: Now therefore restore

they walked through the wilderness, even unto the red see, and came to Cades,

Israel abode still in Cades. And then they went a long through the
wilderness, of the said country. And they conquered all the costs of the
Amorites, from Arno^ unto Iabok, and from the wyldernes unto Iorda^. So now
forasmoche as the Lord God of Israel has cast out the Amorites before his

to war upon me. The Lord therefore be judge this day, between the children
of Israel, and the children of Ammon. Nevertheless the king of ye children of
Ammon harkened not unto the words of Iephthah which he sent him.

Then the spirit of the Lord came upon Iephthah. And he passed over Galaad
and Manasses, and came to Mazphah, that lies in Galaad, and from thence unto
the children Iephthah voweth.

them from Aroer unto Menith, twenty cities. And so forth to the plain of

four hundred thousand foot men that drew swerdes. And the children of
Benjamin herd that the children of Israel were gone up to Marphah. Then said
the children of Israel, tell us how this wickedness happened. And the Leuyte
the slain woman's husband answered and said: I came in to Gabaah in Benjamin
with my concubyne to lodge all night. And the cytezens of Gabaah arose against
me, and beset the house round about me by night, and thought to have slain me:
but they caught my concubine and forced her, that she dyed. Wherefore I took my
concubine and cut her in pieces, and sent her through out all the lands of the
enheritaunce of Israel. For they have done abominacion and folly in Israel.
Behold, ye are all children of Israel. Consydre therefore, and give your
advise in the case. Then all the people arose, as it had been one man, saying:
there shall not one of us go to his tent, ne turn in to his house. And now
this is it yt we will do to Gabaah and cast lottes against it. And we will take
ten men of the hundred through out all the trybes of Israel, and an

And the children of Israel arose and went up to Bethell, and asked of God,
who should begin the battle against the children of Benjamin, and the Lord
said Judah shall be your captain. And the children of Israel stood up early and
beseged Gabaah. And the me^ of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin,
and put them selves in array against them, to fight against Gabaah. And the
children of Benjamin came out of Gabaah and destroyed in Israel that

children of Israel plucked up their hertes, and yet eftsoon made battle in
the same place where they did the first day: but they went first up and wept
before the Lord unto even, and asked of the Lord,
saying: shall we go again to battle against ye children of Benjamin our
brethren? And the Lord said: go up unto them, when the children of Israel
were come to the children of the second day, and destroyed to the earth of the
children of Israel ones again.xviij. thousand men that drew swerdes every

Then the children of Israel and all the people went up and came unto gods
house and wept and sat there before the Lord, and fasted the same day unto

they asked the Lord: for there was the arcke of the apoyntment of God, in those

at that time: and they said, shall we go out any more to battle against the
children of Be^ Iamin our brethren, or shall we cease? And

And then all the men of Israel rose up out of their standing, and put them

plaged Benjamin before Israel, so that the children of Israel destroyed in

thousand men / and stycked unto them until they came to Gadaam, and flewe two
thousand moo of them / so that all that were slain that same day of Benjamin,
were.xxv. thousand men that drew swerdes / and all men of might: only six
hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness, unto the rock of
pomegarnettes, and abode there four months. And then the men of Israel
turned back again unto the children of Benjamin / and smote them with the
edge of the sword in the cities both man and beast, and all that came to

And the people came to Bethel and abode there till even before God / and lift

chanced in Israel, that there should be this day one tribe lacking in
Israel? And on the morrow the people arose erly, and made there an altar, and
offered burnt offerynges and peaxofferinges.

And ye children of Israel asked who are they among all the tribes of Israel
that came not with the congregation unto the Lord / for they had made a great
oath concerning them that came not up to the Lord to Mazphah, saying they
should surely dye. And the children of Israel had pitye on Benjamin their
brethren, and said / there is one tribe cut of from Israel this day: what shall
we do unto the rest of them, to get the^ wives, for as much as we have sworn
by the Lord, that we will not give them any saying: Go and smite the
enhabitauntes of Iabes Galaad, with the edge of the sword as well women as
children, Number.xxxi.c
And this is that ye shall do: utterly destroy all the males and all the women
that have lain by men. And they found among the inhabitants of Iabes Galaad
four hundred damselles virgynes that had known no man by lyinge with any
male. And they brought them unto the host to Siloh which is in the land of
Canaan. And the hole congregation sent and spoke Iudi.xx.c
and called peasably unto them, and Benjamin came again at that time, and they
gave them the women which they had saved a live of the women of Iabes Galaad.
But they so suffised them not. And the people had compassion on Benjamin
because that God had made a gappe in the trybes of Israel. And then the elders
of the congregation said: What shall we do to the remnaunt of them, to get
them wives, seeing all the wives of Benjamin are destroyed? And they said there
must be an enheritaunce for them that be escaped of Benjamin that a trybe be
not destroyed out of Israel: how be it, we may not give them wives of our
daughters. For the children of Israel had made an adiuracion, saying: cursed
be he that gives a wife to Benjamin. Then they said

And the children of Israel went thence at that time every one to his trybe,

gather the ears that remain, and do her no despyte. And thereto pull out of

her mother in law unto her, where gatheredst thou to day? and where wroughtest
thou? blessed be he that knew the. And she showed her mother in law with
whom she had wrought, and said: the man's name with whom I wroughte to
day, is Booz. Then said Noemi unto her daughter in law, blessed be he, for he
cease not to do the same goodness to the deed, that he did to the living.
And Noemi said unto her: the man is nigh unto us, even of our next kynne. And
Ruth the Moabyte said: he bad me also yt I should continue with his young men,
until they had ended all the harvest he has. Then said Noemi unto Ruth her
daughter in law, it is best my daughter that thou goo out with his maidens,
and that no man mete the in any other field. And so she kept her by the
maidens of Booz, to gather unto the end of barleye harvest and of where

and also his vows: but Hannah went not up for she said unto her husband: I
will tarry until the child be wened, and then I will bring him, that he may
appear before the Lord, and there abide for ever. (...)
And Elkanah her husband said to her: do what seems the best: tarry till thou
have wened him, only the Lord make good his saying. And so the women abode
and gave her son suck, till she wened him. And then she took him with her,
when she had wened him, with three bullockes and an Epha of flower and a bottel
of wine, and brought him unto the house of the Lord in Siloh howbeit the
child was yet young. And they slew the bullockes and brought in the child
to Eli, and then she said: Oh my Lord: as truly as thy soul lives my Lord:
I am the woman that stood by the here, prayinge unto the Lord and for this
child I prayed, and the Lord has given me my desire which I asked of him:
and therefore I also lend him the Lord, as long as he may be lent the Lord.

But the child Samuel ministered before the Lord gyrded about with a lynnen

Israel to Mazphah, that I may pray for you unto the Lord. And they assembled at
Mazphah, and drew water and poured it out before the Lord, and fasted the
same day, and said there: we have sinned against the Lord. And Samuel judged
the causes of the children of Israel in Mazphah. When the Philistines herd
that the children of Israel were assembled at Mazphah, the Lords of the
Pilistines went up against Israel, which when the children of Israel herd,
they were afraid of the Philistines, and said to Samuel / cease not to (...)
the stone of help, saying / thus far has the Lord helped up. And so the
Philistines were brought under yt they came no more in to the costs of Israel
/ for the hand of the Lord was upon the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
Then the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel, came again to
Israel, from Akaron to Geth, with the coostes of the same, which Israel
plucked out of the hands of the Philistines. For there was peax between Israel
and the Amorites. And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life, and went
about year by year to Bethel, Galgal, and Mazphah, and judged Israel in all
those places / and came again to Ramath, for there was his house / and there
he judged Israel / and there he buylte an altar unto the Lord.

Because Samuelles sons did mynyster evil, the people require a king: and

displeased Samuel, when they said: Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel
prayed unto (...)

Nevertheless the people would not hear the voice of Samuel, but did say:

And Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them in to the parlour and
made them sytte in the chyefe place among them that were bydden / which were

And the cook took up the shoulder and brought it, and set it before Saul. And
Samuel said: Behold, that is left set it before the, and eat / for I kept it

Samuel that day. And when they were come down from ye hill in to the city,
Samuel communed with Saul in the gallerye: and they arose erly. And about the

And in the way by which Ionathas sought to goo over unto the garrison of the

on the other side: the one called Bozez, and ye other Seneb. And the one
leans northwarde toward Machmas, and the other southwarde toward Gabaah.

then we will stand still where we be and not goo up unto them. But if they so
say unto us: come hither unto us, then we will goo up, for the Lord has

Ahia: bring hither the Arcke of God. For the arcke of God was at that time

skremysshe began in the host of the Philistines, and it increased and was

How be it there was no man that moved his hand to his mouth, because that
the people feared the curse. But Ionathas herd not when his father adjured
the people, wherefore he put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand
and dypte it in an honey comb, and put his hand to his mouth and forthwith his
eyes received their old virtue and courage. Then spoke one of the people and
said: thy father adjured the people, saying: Cursed be the man that eats
any fode this day, and yet the people were faint Then said Ionathas: my
father has troubled the land: for behold my eyes have recovered their power
and strength, because I tasted a little of this honey: how then if all ye people
had eaten of the spoil of their enemies which they found, had there not been
then a much greatter slaughter among the Philistines? And they laid on the
Philistines

Then the people gat them to the spoil, Deute.xii.
and took sheep oxen and calves, and slew them on the ground, and did eat
with the blood. Then men told Saul, saying: Behold ye people sin against
the Lord, in that they eat with the blood. And he said: ye have trespased,
But roll a great stone unto me now, and go abroad among the people and bid
them bring every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and
sin not against the Lord / in eating with the blood. And the people
brought every man his ox in his hand by night and slew them there. And Saul
made an aultare unto the Lord, And that was the first aultare that he made
unto the Lord. And Saul said: Let us go down after the Philistines by night
/ and let us make hauoke among them till it be day in the morning, and let us
not leave one of them. And the people answered, do whatsoever thou think
best. Then said ye preaste: Let us come hither unto God. And Saul asked of
God: Shall I goo down after the Philistines? and wylt thou give them

Then he said unto all Israel: Be ye on one side, and I and Ionathas my son
will be on an other. And the people said unto Saul: What thou think best
that do. And Saul said unto the Lord God of Israel: give perfect knowledge.
And Saul and Ionathas were apprehended by the lotte, and the people escaped
free. Then said Saul: cast lottes between me and Ionathas my

Then said Saul God deal so and so with me, but if thou dye Ionathas. But the
people said unto Saul: shall Ionathas dye which has so myghtely help
Israel? God forbid, The people do rescow Ionathas that he dye not.
As truly as the Lord lives, there shall not one hear of his head fall to the
ground: for he has wroughte with God this day. And so the people delivered
Ionathas, that he dyed not. And then Saul ceased from following the
Philistines. And the Philistines returned to their own place. And so Saul
took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every
side: against the Moabites: against the children of Ammon: against the
Edomites: against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. And whether
so ever he turned him self, there he wanne, and demeaned him self valiauntly,
and slew the Amaleckites, and ryd Israel out of the hands of them that
spoiled them.
The sons of Saul were Ionathas, Iesui, and Melchisua. And his two daughters
were thus named: the elder Merob, and the younger Michol. And the name of

Saul is commanded to sley Amaleck. He is disobedient to the voice of God, and

THen said Samuel unto Saul: ye Lord sent me to annoint the, i. Regum.x.c

words of the Lord. Thus says the Lord of hosts: I have called to

how they lay in wait for them in the way, as they came out of Egypt. Now
therefore go and smite the Amaleckites, and destroy ye only all that pertayneth
unto them, and se thou have no compassion on them. But slay man and woman,
int^nt and suckinge, ox, sheep, c^^ell, and Ass. And Saul assembled the
people and nombred them in Tel^im two hundred thousand footmen, and ten
thousand men of Judah. And Saul came unto a cy^e of the Am^leckites, and fought
in a valey. But Saul said unto ye Ke^^es: go and depart and get ye away from
the Amaleckites, leest I destroy you with them for ye showed mercy to Israel
when they came out of Egypt. And the Kenites departed from the Amaleckites.
And Saul slew the Amaleckites (...)
and took Agag the king of the Amaleckites a live, and utterly destroyed all
the people with the edge of the sword. But Saul and the people spared Agag,
(...)
and they left of the sheep and of the oxen and fat things and the lambs and
all that was good, and would not destroy them. But all that was naught worth
and flaggye, that they destroyed utterly. Then came the word of the Lord unto
Samuel, saying: it forthinked me that I have made Saul king. For he is turned
from me and has not fulfilled my commandments, D^^
and had set him up a pyller of triumph. And was turned and departed and
gone to Galgal.

And when Samuel was come to Saul, Saul said unto him: Blessed be thou in the
Lord. I have done the commandment of ye Lord. And Samuel answered: What
means (...)
when thou were little in thine own sight, were thou not made the heed of the
trybes of Israel? And ye Lord anointed the, king over Israel. And then the
Lord sent the on a viage, and said unto the, se thou utterly destroy those
sinners the Amaleckites and fight against them, till ye have utterly destroyed
them, wherefore

And Saul said unto Samuel: I have obeyed the voice of the Lord, and went
the way which the Lord sent me, and have brought Agag the king of the
Amaleckites. And have utterly destroyed the Amaleckites. And the people took
of the spoil, sheep, oxen, and the che^est of the things which should have
been destroyed, to offer unto the Lord thy God in Galgal. Then said Samuel,
requires the Lord burnt sacrifices and offeringes, and not rather that thou
should obaye his voice? Behold, to obaye is better then offering, (...)
and to give hyde, is better, then the f^t of Rams. For rebellyousnesse is as
the sin of wytchecraft: and stubburnesse is wickedness and Idolatrye.
Because therefore thou have cast away the word of the Lord / therefore has
the Lord cast away the also / from being king. Then said Saul to Samuel:
I have sinned, for I have offended the mouth of the Lord, and thy words,
because I feared the people and they obayed their voice. But now take away my
sin, and turn again with me, that I may worshype the Lord. Then said
Samuel unto Saul: I will not return with the: for thou have cast away the
commandment of God, and therefore the Lord has cast away the also, that
thou shalt not be King over Israel. And as Samuel turned to goo away, he
caught the lap of his root, and it rent. Then Samuel said, the Lord has
rent the Kingdom of Israel from this day, and has given it to a neighbor
of thine that is better then thou. And thereto, he that gives vyctorye to
Israel, will not beguyle nor repent,
for he is not a man, that can repent. Then he said: I have sinned. But yet
honor me before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again
with me, that I may pray unto the Lord thy God. And Samuel turned again and
followed Saul. And Saul prayed unto ye Lord. The^ (...) vii.c. (...) xiiii. g
so shall thy mother be childlesse among other women. And so Samuel hewed Agag
in pieces before the Lord in Galgal. And the^ Samuel departed to Ramath. And
Saul went home to his house to Gabaah Saul. But Samuel came no more to se Saul
till the day of his death. Nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul, because the
Lord repented that he had made him king over Israel.

ANd then the Lord said unto Samuel: (...) ii. b ^ Chal^ ^^pare xi. d (...)
Cleanse your selves and come with me to the offringe. And he purified Isai and
his sons, and bad them to the offering. And when they were come he looked on
Eliab and said: the Lords anointed is before him. But the Lord said unto
Samuel Look not on his facyon nor on the heyght of his stature, for I have
refused him. Because it is not as man sees.
For man looks on the outward apperaunce: but the Lord beholds the heart.
Then Isai called Abinadab, and made him come before Samuel. And he said:
Neither has the Lord chosen this. Then Isai made Samah come, and he said:
neither yet has the Lord chosen this. Then made Isai seven of his sons
come before Samuel. And Samuel said, the Lord has chosen none of these.

Then said Samuel to Isai: Are here all thy children? And he said: The

The battle of the Philistines against Israel. Little David overcomes
great Goliath.

CAPI. XVII.
THe Philistines gathered their host to and put them selves in array, to
fight against the Philistines. And the Philistines stood on an hyl on the one
side, and Israel on an hyl on the other side, and a baley between them. And
then came a man and stood in the mids, out of the tents of the Philistines
named Goliath, of Geth six cubits and an handbredth long, Goliath.
and had an helmet of brass upon his heed, and a coote of mayle about him.
And the weight of his coote of mayle was five thousand sycles of brass. And
he had harness of brass upon his legs, and a shylde of brass upon his
shoulders. And the shaft of his spear was like a weuers beam. And his spear
heed wayed six hundred sycles of iron. And one bearing a shylde went before
him.

And he stood and called unto the host of Israel, and said unto them: what
neadeth that ye should come out in array to battle? am not I a Philistine, and
you servants to Saul? chose you a man, and let him come down to me, if he
be hable to fight with me and to beat me, then we will be your servants. But

Then said Saul to David goo, and the Lord be with the. And Saul put his
rayme^t upon David, and put an helmet of brass upon his heed, and put a coote
of mayle upon him, and gyrded David with his own sword upon his raiment. And
he assayed how he could go, for he never proved it. Then said David unto
Saul: I can not go in these, for I have not been used thereto, and put them of
him. I took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smothe stones out of a
broke, and put them in a shepeherdes bag which he had, and took his
slynge in his hand, and went to the Philistine.

And the Philistine came and d^ue nere to David, with the man that bare a
shylde before him. And when the Philistine looked and saw David: he disdayned
him, for he was but a younglynge, roudye and goodly to look upon. And the
Philistine said unto David:
that there is a God in Israel, And all this company shall know, that the
Lord saves not with the sword and spear. For the battle is the Lords,
and he shall give you in to our hands.

And when the Philistine arose and came and drew nygh unto David, David hasted

And when the Philistines saw their champion deed, they fled. And the men of
Israel and of Judah arose and showted and followed after the Philistines, till
they came to the valeye and unto the gates of Akaron. And the Philistines fell
down deed by the way to Samraim even unto Geth and Akaron. And then the
children of Israel returned from chasinge after the Philistines, and spoiled
their tents. And David took the head of the Philistine, (...).xiii. g

Saul saw David issue forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner the
captain of his host: Abner, whose son is this young man? And Abner
answered, as truly as thy soul lives, O king, I can not tell. Then said
ye king: Enquere thou, if he be some noble man's son. And so when David was
returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him
before Saul, with the heed of the Philistine in his hand. And Saul said unto
him: Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered the son of
thy servant Isai the Bethlehemite.

thereto, and said: Saul has slain his thou sand, and David his ten
thousand. Then was Saul exceeding wroth and the saying displeased him, and
he said: They have ascribed unto David ten thousand, and to me but a
thousand, and what can he more have save the kingdom? wherefore Saul looked a

father had done him shame. On the next morning Ionathas went out in to the

host? and Abisai said: I will goo down with the. And so David and Abisai
came to the people by night. And behold,
destroy him not, for who can lay his hand on the Lords anointed and be

water that was at Saul's heed, and they gat them away and no man saw or wist it

and David said to Abner: art not thou a man, and who is like the in Israel?
But wherefore have thou not kept thy Lord the king? For there came one of the
folk to destroy the king thy Lord. It is not good that thou have done. As

David said: it is my voice my Lord king. And he said further wherefore does

And Saul asked counsel of the Lord: But the Lord answered him not, neither by

Then said Saul unto his servants: seek me a woman having a spirit of

And Saul answered: I am sore encombred. For the Philistines make war against
me, and God is departed from me, and answered me no more, neither by prophets,
neither by dreams / and therefore I have called the, to tell me what I shall
do. Then said Samuel: wherefore do thou ask of me? while the Lord is gone
from the, and is thine enemy / the Lord will do to the as he said by my
hand. For the Lord will rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and give it thy
neighbor David, because thou obeyedst not the voice of the Lord, nor
executedst his fearce wrath upon the Amalekites. Therefore has the Lord done
this unto the this day. And further the Lord will deliver Israel with the in
to the hands of ye Philistines / and to morrow shall thou and thy sons be

Philistines. Then Saul fell forthwith flat on the earth, and was fore a dredde

And thereto there was no strength in him, for he had not eaten all the day

So do God to Abner / and so unless as the Lord has sworn to David, I so

give Abner not one word to answer, because he feared him. Then Abner her

Then said Abner unto him, goo and return. And he returned. And Abner had
communycacion with the elders of Israel, saying: Ye have long gone about

shalt feed my people Israel, and shalt be a captain over Israel. And so
all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron. And king David made a
covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord / and they anointed David king
over Israel. David was thyrtye year old what time he bgan to raygne, and he
raygned forty years. In Hebron he raygned over Judah, seven year, and six

Raphaim. And David asked of the Lord, saying: shall I go to the Philistines? and
will thou give them in to my hands? And the Lord said unto David: goo, for I
will deliver the Philistines in to thy hands. And Isa.xxviii. f
the Lord has severed mine enemies asondre before me, as a man would divide
water, and therefore he called the name of the said place Baal Perazim. And
there they left their images, and David and his men took them up. And the
Philistines came yet again, and laid them in the valeye Raphaim. But David
asked the Lord, and he said, goo not. But compass them on the backesyde,
and come upon them from the mulberye trees. And when thou hear the noise of
a thing going in the tops of the trees, then move. For then the Lord is
gone out before the, to smite the host of the Philistines. And David did as
the Lord commanded, and smote the Philistines from Gabaah to Gezer.

his fault,
and there he dyed by the arcke of God. And David was displeased because the
Lord had rent Orah. And the name of the place was called Pe^ez Ozah till this
day. And David was then afraid of the Lord, and said: how should the arcke of
the Lord come to my house? And so David would not bring the arcke of the Lord
with him in to the city of David, but carried it in to the house of Obed Edom a

brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, unto this day: but have walked
in a tent and in a tabernacle. In any way where I went among all the children

And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant it, and they
shall continue in one place and shall move no more, neither shall wicked people
trouble them any more as they did at the beginning / and since the time I

as I took it from Saul, whom I put down before the and thine house, and thy
kingdom shall endure without end after the, and thy seat shall be

am I Lord almyghtye, and what is my kynne, that thou sholdest have brought me
this far forth? And is this a small thing in my sight Lord almyghtye, but
that thou should speak also of thy servants house for a great while to

unto the, sith thou know thy servant Lord almyghtye? Even for thy word,
and according to thine own heart have thou done all these great things to
make them known unto thy servant.

wherefore thou art great, o Lord God, and there is none like ye, neither is
there any God save thou, according to all that we have herd earth is like

a name / and to show them great and terrible things in the earth, before thy
people which thou redemedst to the, out of Egypt / even from the people and
from their gods. And thou have ordained thy people Israel to be thy people
for ever / and thou Lord art their God. And now, Lord God, the thing thou
have said of thy servant and of his house, make it good for ever, and do as
thou haste said. And let thy name be great for ever / that men may say:
the Lord of hosts is the God of Israel: and let the house of thy servant
David be assured before the. For thou Lord of hosts, God of Israel have told
in the ear of thy servant, saying: I will build the an house. And therefore
has thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto the. And now
Lord almighty thou art the God, and thy words must be true / for thou haste
told this goodness unto thy servant. Now therefore go to, and bless the
household of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before the. For thou

and he has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son. And
thou art wrapped about with thyn own myschefe, because thou art a blood sheder.

Suffer him therefore to curse for the Lord has bydden him / happily the Lord
will look on my wretchedness, and do me good for his cursinge this day. And
thus as David and his men went by the way, Semei went alonge on the hills

cast dust. And the king and all that were with him came very weary, and
refresshed them selves there.

And Absalom and all the people of the men of Israel came to Jerusalem and
Achitophel with him. And as soon as he was come / Husai the Arachite Dauides

the kings son is deed. The^ said Ioab to Chusi go and tell the king what

made an end of building his own house and the house of the Lord, and the

of David his father, save only that he sacrificed and offered ince^se upon
aulters in hills.

And the king went to Gabaon to offer there / for that was a great offering
place. And there Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerynges upon that altar.
And in Gabaon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night. And God
said: Ask what I shall give the. And Solomon said: thou have showed unto thy
servant David my father great mercy / because that he walked before the in
truth and in ryghtousnesse and playnesse of heart with the. And thou haste
kept for him this great mercy, that thou have given him a son to sytte on

the Lord well, that Solomon had hesyred this thing. Wherefore God said unto him:
because thou have asked this thing, and have not asked long life, neither haste
asked richesse, nor the lives of thine enemies, but have asked the discrecion
to understand equite: Lo, I have done according to thy peticyon: and
behold, I have given the a wise and an understanding heart, so that there was
none like heretofore, neither after the shall any arise like unto the. And
thereto I have given the that thou askedst not, (...)
both richesse and honor: so (...)
And if thou will walk in my ways to keep mine ordynaunces and
commandments, as David thy father did walk, I well lengthen thy days also.
When Solomon awoke, he understood this was his dream. And he came to Jerusalem
and presented him self before the arcke of the Lords covenant, and offered
burntofferynges and peaxofferynges, and made a feast to all his servants.

Then came two women that were harlots unto the king, and stood before him.

I was delivered of a child with her in the saydhouse. So the third day after
I was delivered, she was delivered also: we two being together, and no
stranger with us in the house save we two alone. And this wives child dyed in a

son from my side, while thine handmayde stepte and laid it in her bosom,
and put her deed child in my bosom. And when I arose up in the morning to
give my child suck: lo, it was deed. But when I had looked more diligently

Then spoke the woman that was mother to the child alive unto the king (for
he bowelles yerned upon her son) and said: I beseech the my Lord, Luc.i. g

shall be neither thine nor mine, but diuyde it. Then the king answered and
said: Luc.vii. ^

servants, which shall take all that is glorious in thine eyes, and bring it
away with them

Then there came a Prophet to the king of Israel, and said to him: Go
forth and play the man, be wise and take heed what thou do: for when the
year is gone about, the king of Siria will come against yt again Then said
the servants of the kings of Siria to him / The gods of the hills are
their gods, and therefore they had the better of us. But let us fight with
them in ye plain and undoubtedly we shall have the better of them. And this do
/ take the kings away every man out of his place, and put Dukes in their
rowmes. And furnysh the a new host, like ye host that thou have lost, and horse
for horse, and charet for charet, and let us fight with them in the plain,
and for a wager, we get the better of the^. And the king herkened unto their
counsel and did even so.

And as soon as the year was gone about, Benhadad nombred the Sirians and went
up the Lord. An^ they pytched one over against the other.vij. days, and the
seventh day they joined battle. And the children of Israel slew of the Sirians
an hundred thousand footmen in one day. And the rest fled to Aphek into ye
city. And there fell a wall upon.xxvij. thousand of them that were left. And
Benhadad fled and went into the city, from chamber to chamber.

Then said his servants unto him: Behold, we have herd say, that the
kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Let us put sack cloth
about our loins, and ropes about our heddes, and go out to the king of Israel:
happily he will save thy life. So they gyrded sack clothe about their loins,
and put ropes about their heddes, and went out to the king of Israel and
said: thy servant

Then a certain man of the children of the prophets said unto his fellow with
the word of the Lord, smite me I pray the. And the man would not smite him.
And he said, because thou haste not obeyed the voice of the Lord: behold, as soon as thou art departed from me a Lion shall sley the. And as ^one as he was
departed from him, i. Regu.xvii. a
a Lion round him and slew him. Then he found an other man and said to him:
smite me I pray the. And the man gave him a good strype and wounded him. And
the Prophet went forth and waited for the king by the way and tied a
kerchefe over his eyes, and put him self out of knowledge. And when the king
came by, he cried unto him and said: thy servant went out in the mids of
the battle. And so, there was one began to flee. And there came a man to me and
said: keep thou this man. And if
And as thy servant had here and there to do, he was gone. And the king of
Israel said unto him: even so shall thy judgment be as thou have defined it
thy self.

And he hasted and unfolded the kerchefe away from his eyes: and the king of
Israel knew him, that he was of the Prophets. And he said unto the king, iii.
Reg.xxii. f
thus says ye Lord because thou have let go a man yt ought to have dyed, thy
life shall go for his life, and thy people for his. And the king of Israel
went to his house al sad and heart heavy, and e^tred into Samaria

Iezabel commands to kill Naboth, for the vyneyard that he refused to sell
Achab. Heliah reproves Achab, and he repents.

AFter these things were done, it chanced

Then Iezabel his wife came to him, and said unto him: Why art thou so
froward, that thou eatest no meat? And he said unto her, I spoke unto Naboth
the Iezrahelyte, and said unto him: Give me thy vyneyarde for silver, or else
if thou will, I will give the another

Then said Iezabell his wife unto him: What a goodly kingdom were thou able
to make in Israel? up and eat meat, and set thine heart at rest, for I will give
yt the vyneyard of Naboth the Iezrahelite. The^ she wrote a letter in Achabs
name and sealed it with his seal, and sent it unto the elders and chief men
of his city that dwelt where Naboth dwelt. And she wrote in the letter saying:
proclayme fasting and set Naboth on high among the people, and set two
naughty fellows before him, and let them testify against him saying: thou
dyddest blaspheme both God and the king And upon that carry him out and stone
him to death.

And upon that they carried him out of ye city and stoned him with stones to

Iezabel herd that Naboth was stoned

And the word of the Lord came unto Eliah the Thesbite saying: arise and go
down to mete Achab king of Israel which is in Samaria. Behold, he is in the
vyneyarde of Naboth: for he is gone down thither, to take possession of it.
And say unto him: thus says the Lord, thou have killed and moreover gotten
possession. And say after that unto him, thus says the Lord: in the place

like the house of Baasa the son of Ahiah, because thou haste provoked me to
anger, and made Israel sin.

And also against Iezabel came the word of the Lord, saying: dogs shall
eat Iezabel under the walls of Iezrahel. And he ye dies of Achab in the
town, him shall dogs eat: and he that dies in the feldes, (...) ^x. b

and that because Iezabel his wife pricked him forward. And therefore he did
exceeding abhominably, in folowinge Ydoles, in all things like as did the
Amorites which the Lord cast out before the children of Israel.

When Achab herd those words, (...)
he re^t his clothes and put sackecloth about his flesh and fasted, and lay in
sack and went confort less. And ye word of the Lord came to Eliah the
Thesbite saying: seyst thou how Achab humbles him self before me? because he
so humbles him self before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in
his sons days I will bring evil upon his house.

Four hundred false Prophets do counsel Achab and Iosaphat to war against

And the third year Iosaphat king of Judah came to the king of Israel. Then
said the king of Israel unto his servants, know ye not that Ramoth in Galaad
is ours, and we sit still and take it not out of the hands of ye king of
Siria? And he said unto Iosaphat: will thou go with me to battle, to Ramoth in
Galaad? And Iosaphat said unto the king of Israel: (...)
I will be as thou art, and my people shall be as thine, and my horses as thine.

And Iosaphat said unto the king of Israel: (...)
ask counsel I pray the of the Lord to day. And then the king of Israel
gathered of the Prophets together, (...)
upon a four hundred men, and said unto them: shall I go to Ramoth in Galaad
to battle, or be still? And they said, go / for the Lord shall deliver it
into the hands of the king. And Iosaphat Micheah.
for he never prophesyeth good unto me, but evil. And Iosaphat said: let not
the king say so. Then the king of Israel called unto one of his chamberlayns
and said: fet Micheah the son of Iemlah hither at ones. And the king of
Israel and Iosaphat the king of Judah sat either in his seat and their apparel
on them, in a void place beside the entering of the gate of Samaria, and all
the Prophets Prophesyenge before them. And Zedekiah the son of Canaanah made
horns of iron and said, thus says the Lord: with these horns thou shall
wynowe the Sirians until thou have made an end of them. And all the
Prophets prophesyed even so, saying: goo to Ramoth Micheas or Micheah.ii.
Par.xviii. d
go and prospere, the Lord shall deliver it into the hands of the king. And
the king said unto him, how often shall I adjure the, that thou tell me
nothing but truth, in the name of the Lord? Then he said I saw all Israel
scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have no shepherdes. And the Lord said
/ those have no master, let them return every man to his house in peax. Then
said ye king of Israel to Iosaphat / did I not tell the, that he would
Prophesye no good unto me, but evil?
And Micheah said / Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord. I saw the ii.
Par.xviii. a
Who shall deceive Achab that he may go and be slain at Ramoth in Galaad? and
one said on this manner and an other on that. Then came forth a sprite and
stood before the Lord and said / I will deceive him. And the Lord said,
wherewith? And he said / I will goo out and be a false sprite in the mouths
of all his Prophets. Ezechi.xiiii. b
And the Lord said, Thou shall deceive him and also prevail, go forth and do
even so. Now therefore behold, the Lord has put a lying spryte in the mouth
of all these thy Prophets / when in very deed the Lord has spoken evil
toward the.

Then Zedekiah the son of Canaanah went to and smote Micheah on the cheke,
and said / How is the spryte of the Lord gone from me, to speak in the?
And Micheah said: Behold, thou shalt se in that day, when thou shall go
from chamber to chamber to bide the. And the king of Israel said Take
Micheah and carry him back again unto Amon the gouerner of the city, and unto
Ioab the kings son, and say: thus says the king. Put ye this fellow in
prison and feed him with bred and water straytly, till I return in peax. Then
Micheah said, if thou come safe again, the Lord has not spoken in me. And
he said, harken ye people every one of you.

And so the king of Israel and Iosaphat ye king of Judah went up to Ramoth in
Galaad. And the king of Israel said to Iosaphat I will change mine apparel
and get me to war: but put thou on thine own apparel. And the king of
Israel changed his rayme^t and went to battle also. But the king of Siria had
commanded the Capitaynes of his charettes of which he had.xxxij. saying:
fight neither with small nor great, save with the king of Israel only. And
when the capitaynes of the charettes saw Iosaphat, they thought he had been
the king of Israel, and therefore turned to him to fight. But Iosaphat cried
out. And when the capitaynes of ye charettes saw he was not the king of
Israel, they turned back from him. And a certain man drew a bow unawares,
and smote the king of Israel between the ribs of his harness. Wherefore the
king said unto the dryuer of his charet, turn thy hand and carry me forth of
the host, for I am hurt. And the feld increased that day, and the king
continued in his charet before the Sirians, and dyed about night. And the
blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the charet. And there went
a Proclamation through out the host after the son was down, saying: let
every man depart to his city and to his own iii. Reg.xxi.c.
and harlottes washed him according unto the word of the Lord which he
spoke. The rest of the deeds of Achab, and all he did, and the Yuory house
which he made, and the cities that he buylt, are written in the book of the
Chronicles of the kings of Israel. And when Achab was laid to rest with his
fathers, Ohoziah his son raygned in his stead.

Iosaphat the son of Asa began to raygne upon Judah, (...)
the fourth year of Achab king of Israel, and was.xxxv. year old when he
began to raygne and raygned.xxv. year in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Azubah
the daughter of Salahi. And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father and
bowed not therfrome, but did that was right in the eyes of the Lord. Only he
did not put the hylaulters out of the way: for the people offered and burnt
their sacrifices yet, in the hylaultares. And he had peax with the king of
Israel.

The rest of the deeds of Iosaphat, and the (...)
are written in the book of Chronicles of the kings of Judah. And also the
remnau^t of the buggery boys, which remained in the days of his father, he
put clean out of the land. There was then no king in Edom, the king was but
a deputy. And Iosaphat made ships in these, to go to Ophir for gold, but
they went not: for the ships brake at Azion Gaber. Then said Ohoziah the
son of Achab unto Iosaphat: Let my servants go with thine in the ships.
But Iosaphat would not. And Iosaphat laid him to sleep with his fathers, and
was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Iehoram his
son raygned in his towme.

And Ohoziah fell through a lattese wyndow out of an upper chamber that he had in
Samaria, and fell sick. The^ he sent messengers, saying unto them: Go and
inquire of Beelzebub the God of Akaron, whether I shall recover of this disease,
or no. But the angel of the Lord spoke to Eliah the Thesbite, arise and go
against the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them: Is there
no God in Israel, that ye go to ask of Beelzebub the God of Akaron. Therefore
thus says the Lord: Thou shall not come down from the bed whereon thou
lie, but shall dye. And Eliah departed.

And the messengers turned back again unto Ohoziah. And he said unto them:

I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven and consume yt and thy
fyfty. And there came fire down from heaven and consumed him and his fyfty.

And the king sent again the third captain over fyftye. And when the third
captain over fyfty was come up to him,
he fell on his knees before Eliah and besought him and said unto him / Oh man
of God, let my life and the life of these fyfty thy servants

And he said unto the king, thus says ye Lord / for as much as thou
sentest messengers to ask through Beelzebub the God of Akaron, as thought
there had been no God in Israel to ask through his word, therefore thou shall
not come of the bed on which thou art mounted, but shalt surely dye. And so he
dyed according to the word of the Lord which Eliah spoke / and Iehoram was
made king in his stead, the second year of Iehora^ son of Iosaphat king of
Judah, because he had no son. The rest of the deeds of Ohoziah which he did,
are written in the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.

Eliah divides the waters with his mantel. He is taken up in to heaven. The

And when they came to Bethell, the children of the Prophets that were at
Bethel, came forth to Elis^us, and said to him: know thou not that ye
Lord will take away thy master that he be no longer thy head this day? And
he said I know it to, hold your peace.

Then said Eliah to Eliseus / tarry here I and as surely as thy soul lives, I
will not leave the, and so they went to Jericho. And the children of the
Prophets that were at Jericho came to Eliseus and said unto him: art thou
not ware that the Lord will take away thy master from the this day? And he
answered: I know it also, hold your peaxe. And Eliah said to him: tarry I
pray the here, for the Lord has sent me to Jordan. But he said: as surely
as the Lord lives, and as thy soul lives, I will not leave the. And so they
went both of them together. And fyftye men of the sons of the Prophets went
and stood in sight a far of, as they two stood by Jordan.


And then Eliah took his mantel and wrapped it together, and smote the water, and
it divided it self / part one way, and part an other / and they two went
over on the dry land. And as soon as they were over, Eliah said to Eliseus /
ask what I shall do for the, er I be taken away from the. And Eliseus said:
let me have thy spirit double in me. And he said: thou have asked an hard
thing. Nevertheless if thou se me when I am taken away from the, thou
shalt have it so: if thou do not, it shall not be. And as they went walking
and talking: behold there came a charet of fire, and horses of fire / and
put them asonder. And Eliah went up in the whorlwynde to heaven. And Eliseus
saw and cried:

And then he took up the mantell of Eliah that fell from him, and went back
again and stood by Iordans side, and with the mantell of Eliah yt fell from
him, he smote the water, and said: where is the Lord God of Eliah, where is
he? And when he had smytten ye water, it divided part this way and part that
way / and Eliseus went over. And the children of the Prophets of Jericho
which saw him a far, said: the spirit of Eliah, does rest on Eliseus /
and went against him, and bowed to the earth unto him. And they said unto him /
se, there be among thy servants fiftye lustye men: let them go and seek thy
master, happly the spirit of the Lord has taken him up and cast him upon
some mountain, or in some valeye. And he said: send not. Nevertheless yet
they lay upon him, till he was ashamed, and said: send, and they sent fyftye
men which sought him three days and three nyghtes / but found him not. And they
came again to him, for he tarried at Jericho. And he said to them / did I not
say unto you that ye should not go? Then the men of Jericho said to Eliseus:
And he said: bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought
it to him. And he went unto the spring of the water, and cast the salt in
thither / and said, thus says the Lord: I heal this water / there shall not
come henceforth either death, or bareynnesse. And the water was helthsome ever
after, according to the saying of Eliseus which he spoke.

And he went from thence up to Bethell. And as he was going in the way /
there came little laddes out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him:
goo up thou balde heed / goo up thou balde heed. And he turned back, and
looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And there came two
bears out of the wodde, and tare.xlij. of the boys. And he went from
thence to mount Carmel, and from thence went aagayne to Samaria.

smote him in his charet at the going up to Sur by Ie^^^am, and fled to Magedo,

his sepulcher with his fathers in the city of David. And in the eleventh year
of Iehoram son of Achab, began Ohoziah to raygne over Judah. And when Iehu was
come to Iezrahel, Iezabel herd of it, and depeinted her eyes, and tired her

But Ioachaz besought ye Lord, and ye Lord herd him. For he had seen the

And Salmanasar king of Assiria came upon him / and Hosea became his servant,
and gave him trybutes. And the king of Assyria found treason in Hosea,
because he had sent messengers to Sua king of Egypt, and sent no tributes
unto the king of Assiria, as he was yearly wont to do. Therefore the king of
Assiria besyeged him and bound him and put him in prison. (...) xviii b
And then the king of Assiria came through out all the la^d and came to Samaria
and beseged it three year. And in the nynthe year of Hosea, (...) xviii.c (...)

the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away unto Assiria and put
them in Hala, in Habor on the river of Gozan, and in the cities of ye Medes.
For the children of Israel had sinned
And they buylt them hylaulters in all their cities, both in the towers where
they kept watch and also in the strong towns. And they made them Images and
supersticious woods on every high hill and under every grene tree. And there
they sacrificed in the hylaultars, as did the heythen, which the Lord carried
away at their coming, and wrought wicked deeds to anger the Lord with. And
they served Ydoles, concerning which thing the Lord had said to the^: ye
shall not do so. And the Lord testified to Israel and to Judah, (...).iiii. f.
by all the prophets and by all the Sears, saying: Turn from your wicked
ways, (...).xxv.
and keep my commandments and mine ordinances, according to all the laws
which I commanded your fathers, and as I sent to you by my servants
but hardened their necks, like to the necks of their fathers that did not
believe ye Lord their God. (...) iiii. f. (...) iii. b
And they refused his ordinances and his covenant that he had made with their
fathers, and the witness which he had wytnessed to them, and followed vanity
and became vain, like to the heythen, yt were roundeabout them, of which, the
Lord had charged them, that they should not do like them. But they left the
commandments of the Lord their God, (...) xii. b
and made them Images of metal, that is to say two calves and made groves and
bowed them selves unto all the host of heaven, and served Baal. And they
sacrificed their sons and their daughters in fire,
and used ^^^checraft and enchau^tementes, and had even appointed them selves
to work^ wickedness in the sight of the Lord, force anger him.

Wherefore the Lord was exceeding wroth with Israel and put them out of his

And so he translated Israel out of their land to Assiria, even unto this day.

And the king of Assiria brought people from Babylon and from Cutha, and
from Aua, and from Hemath, and from Sepharuaim, and put them in the cities of
Samaria instead of the children of Israel. And they possessed Samaria and
dwelt in the cities thereof.
Wherefore ye Lord sent Lions upon them which slew them. Then men told the
king of Assyria, saying: The nations which thou have brought and put in the
cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land, and therefore he
has sent Lions upon them, which slay them because they know not the manner of
the God of the land.

Then the king of Assiria commanded saying: carry thither one of the priests
which ye brought thence, and let him go and dwell there, and teach them the
facyon how to serve the God of the countreye. And then one of the preastes
which they had carried thence, went and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how
they should fear the Lord. How be it every nation made their own Gods and
put them in the houses of the hilaultares which the Samari^ans had made,
every nation in their cities where they dwelt. The me^ of Babylon made Socoth,
Benoth. The me^ of Cuth Socoth. Benoth. Nergel. Asima. Nebahaz. Tharthak.
Anamelech.
The Euites made Nebahaz, and Tharthak. And the Sepharuaites burnt their
children in fire unto Adramelech. and Anamelech, the gods of the
Sepharuaites. And though they feared the Lord, yet they made them preastes of
the lowest of the people, for the hilaulters which sacrificed for them in the
houses of the hilaultars. And so they feared the Lord, and yet served their
own gods after the manner of the people from whence they were brought.

Unto this day they do after the old manner: they neither fear the Lord,
neither do after their own ordinances and customs, and after the law and
commandment which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob whose name he
called Israel, and made an appointment with them and charged the^ saying:
fear not any other gods. Gene.xxxii. b Iud.vi. Iere.x. a
no^ baw your selves to them nor serve them, no^ sacrifice to them: but to the
Lord which brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and a
stretched out arm^: ^^m fear and to ^im bow, and to him do sacrifice. And the
ordinances, customs, law and commaundment which I wrote for you, se ye be
diligent to do, for ever more, and fear not any other gods. And the
appointment that I have made with you, se ye forget not, and that you fear
none other gods: but the Lord your God ye shall fear, and he shall deliver
you out of the hands of all your enemies. How be it they herd not, but did
after ye old manner. And even so did these nations fear the Lord and serve
their Images thereto: and so did their children and their childrens children to.
Even as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.

Assiria did carye away Israel unto Assiria, and put them in Halah and in Habor

to king Ezechias with a great host to Jerusalem. And they went up and came to
Jerusalem, and went and stood by the coundyt of the ouermost pole which is in
the way to the fullers field, and called to the king. And there came out to
them, Eliakim the son of Helkiah stuarde of household and Sobnah the scribe,
and Ioah the son of Asaph, there corder. And then Rabsakeh said to them. Tell
ye Ezechias I pray you: thus says the great king the king of Assyria. What

If ye say unto me, we trust in the Lord our God. Is not this God he, whose
hylaultares and other aulters to, Ezechias has put down, and has said to
Judah and Jerusalem, bow your selves before this altar here in Jerusalem? Now
therefore join thy self to my Lord the king of Assiria, and I will deliver
the two thousand horses, if thou be hable to set ryders upon them: (and if
thou be not) how then art thou hable to resist one of the less Dukes of my
masters servants? or trustust thou to Egypt for chareties and horsemen?
Moreover th^nkesse thou I am come without the bydding of the Lord to this
place to destroy it? Nay: the Lord said to me, go up to this land and
destroy it. Then said Eliakim the son of Helkiah and Sobnah and Ioab, to
Rabsakeh:

And so Rabsakeb stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews language, and
spoke, saying: Hear the saying of the great king, the king of Assiria.
Thus says the king: Let not Ezechias beguyle you, for he is not hable to
deliver you out of mine hand^ neither let Ezechias make you trust to the Lord
saying: the Lord shall surely ryd us, and this city shall not be delivered
into the hands of the king of Assiria. Harken not unto Ezechias, for thus
says the king of Assiria. Deal kyndely with me, and come out to me. And then
eat every man of his own vine, and of his fygge tree, and drink every man of
the water of his own well, till I come and fet you to as good a land as yours
is, a land of corn and wine, a land of bred and vynyardes, a land of olyue
trees of oil and of honey. And ye shall live and not dye. And harken not unto
Ezechias for he will beguyle you, saying: the Lord shall deliver us. For have
the gods of the nacyons delivered any God his land, out of the hand of the
king of Assyria? where are the gods of Hemath and of Arphad? where are the
gods of Sepharuaim of Ana and Auah? did they deliver Samaria out of mine
hands? what God of any land has delivered his land out of mine hand, that
the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?

But the people held their peax and answered not him a word: for the king
had commanded, saying: answer him not. Then Eliakim the stuarde of

to Ezechias with their clothes re^t and told him the words of Rabsakeh.

would hear all the words of Rabsakeh, whom the king of Assiria his master

When Ezechias had received the lettres of the hand of the messengers and
had red them: he went into the house of the Lord, and laid them abroad

kingdoms of the earth, and thou have made both heaven and earth. Lord, bow
thine ears and hear: Open Lord thine eyes and se: and hear the words of
Sennacherib which has sent to rail on the living God. Certes o Lord, the

has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back again ten
degrees? And Ezechias said: It is a light thing for the shadow to go down
ten degrees. Therefore I will not that: but let the shadow go backwarde ten
degrees. And Isai the Prophet called to the Lord, and he brought ye shadow
ten degrees backwarde by which it had gone down, in the dyall of Achaz. (...)

and made him king in his fathers rowme.

And Ioachaz was three and twenty years old, when he began to raygne, and
raygned three months in Jerusalem. His mo^hers name was Hamital, the daughter
of Ieremia of Lobnah. And he did that displeased the Lord, in all things as
his fathers had done. And Pharao Necoa put him in bonds at Reblah, Jeremy.xxii.
which when he came to Egypt / dyed there.

And Ioakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharao: how be it he taxed the
land, to give the money at the commandment of Pharao, and as every man was
set at, so he required the silver and the gold of the people of the land, to
give Pharao Necoa. Ioakim was five and twenty years old, when he began to
raygne, and he raygned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother was named Zebda
the daughter of Phadaia of Rama. And he did that was evil in the syghte of the

And so Solomon fynyshed the house of the Lord, and the kings house, and all

Thou shall have ever one or other that shall rule in Israel. But if ye turn
away and forsake mine ordinances and my commandments which I have set

then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given
them, and will cast this house which I have sanctified for my name out of my

of their fathers which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and claue to

And all the people that were left of the Hethites, Amorites. Pheresites,
Heuites and Iebusites, make tributaries unto this day. But of the children of
Israel did Salomo^ make no bo^dmen in his work: but they were men of war and
rulers and great Lords with him, and capitaynes over his charettes and

And Salomo^ brought the daughter of Pharao

And all the work of Solomon went well forward even from the day of the
foundation of the house of the Lord was laid: till he had fynyshed it, that

Roboam and said. Thy father made us a grievous yoke: but remyt thou somewhat of

Now when Jeroboam and all Israel were come the third day, as the king bad,
saying: come again to me the third day: The king answered them cruelly:
for king Roboam left the counsel of the aged men, and answered them after the
advise of the young men, saying: If my father have made your yoke greuouse, I
will add thereto / and where my father chastised you with whippes, I will
chastise you with scorpions. And so the king harkened not unto the people /
for the turnyng away was of God,

returned from going against Jeroboam.

And Roboam dwelte in Jerusalem and buylt strong cities in Judah: as Bethlehem,

Sixtene year old was Oziah when he began to raygne, and he raygned two and

But Azarias the priest went in after him with four score priests of ye
Lord that were bold men. And they stepte to Oziah the king, and said to
him: it pertayneth not to the Oziah to burn incense unto the Lord, but to the

Wherefore the Lord his God delivered him in to the hand of the king of the
Sirians: which beat him, and carried away a great multitude of his captive in

Israel, which slew of his a mighty slaughter. For Phakeh the son Romeliah

Zechri a mighty man in mount Ephraim slew Maasiah the kings son, and

and to make them bondemen and bondewomen. What other thing do ye (ye

prisoners again which ye have taken of your brethren, for the great wrath
of the Lord is upon you.

And certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim: as Azarias the son of
Iohanan, Barachiah the son of Mesimeloth, Iehezekiah the son of Selum, and

And Ezechias answered and said: now

But the preastes were to few, and were not hable to fleye all the

herted to sanctify them selves then the preastes. And thereto the
burntoffringes were many with the fat of the peaxofferinges and the
drynkeoffringes that belonged to ye burntofferinges. And so the service

Ezechias king of Judah gave for heaueoffringes to the congregation a thousand
oxen and seven thousand sheep. And the Lords gave to the congregation for

content to help him. And so there gathered much people together and stope all
the wells and the broke that ran through the mids of the land, entendinge
that the kings of Assure should not find much water, when they came. And he

Moreover have ye not heed what I and my fathers have done unto the people of

But Ezechias the king and the Prophet Isai son of Amoz prayed concerning
that thing and cried up to heaven. And the Lord sent an angel and destroyed
all the men of war and the Lords and Capitaynes of the host of the king of
Assure, that he turned his face with shame toward his own land. And when he
was come into the house of his God, he was there overthrown with the swerd even
by them that issued out of his bowels. And so the Lord saved Ezechias and the
inhabiters at Jerusalem out of the hands of Sennacherib king of Assure and of
all other, and mayntened them on all sides, In so much that many brought
presents unto the Lord to Jerusalem and preciouse gifts to Ezechias king of
Judah: so that he was magnifyed in the sight of all nations from thence forth.
(...)
In those days Ezechias was sick unto ye death and besought the Lord: which
answered him and showed him a wonderful miracle: But Ezechias did not
according to the curtesye showed him, for his heart arose: and therefore came
there wrath upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem. Notwithstanding Ezechias
mekened him self for the arysing of his here both he and the inhabiters of
Jerusalem. Wherefore the wrath of the Lord fell not upon them in the days of
Ezechias.

which Manasses his father made, and served them, and me^ened not him self
before the Lord, as Manasses his father had mekened him self: But Amon
trespassed greatly. Wherefore his own servants conspired against him and slew
him in his own house. And the people of the land slew all that had conspired

walked in the ways of David his father bowinge neither to the ryghthande ne to

he began to seek after the God of David his father. And in the.x^^. year he
began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of hyllaulters, groves, kerued Images, and
Images of metal: so that they brake down ye aulters of Baals even in his
presence, and the Idolles that were upon them, he called to be destroyed. And
the groves,
kerued Images, and Images of metal he brake and made dust of them, and
strawed it upon the gr^ues of them that had offered to them. And he burnt the
bones in the cities of Manasses, Ephraim, Simeon and of Nephthali. And in the
wyldernesses of them roundeabout he plucked a sondre the aultares and the
groves and did beat them and stamp them to powdre, and be down the ydoles
thorowout all the land of Israel: and then returned to Jerusalem.

In the.xviij. year of his raygne when he had purged the land and the temple,
he sent Saphan the son of Azalia, and Maasiah the gouernoure of the city,
and Ioah the son of Ioachaz the recorder, to repair the house of the Lord
his God. And when they came to Helkiah the high preaste, men delivered them
the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept
ye enteryes had gathered of the hands of Manasses and Ephraim and of all that
yet remained in Israel and of all Judah and Benjamin and of the enhabiters of
Jerusalem. And they put it in the hands of the worckme^ that had the oversight
of the house of the Lord, which gave it to the laborers that wrought on the
house of the Lord, to repair and mende

And the ouersears of them to courage them were Iahath and Obadiah Levites of

Music. And over the bearers of burdens and over all that wrought, in what so
ever workmanship it were, were there scribes, officers and porters of the
Levites.

The book of the law is found.
And as they brought out the money that was brought into the house, Helkiah ye

answered and said to Saphan the scrybe: I have found ye book of the law in
the house of the Lord, and gave the book to Saphan. And Saphan carried


And when the king had herd the words of the law, he tare his clothes, and
commanded Helkiah and Ahikam the son of Sapha^ and Abadon the son of Micah
and the said Saphan the scribe and Asaia a servant of the kings, saying: go
and enquire of the Lord for me and for them that are left in Israel and Judah,
concerning the words of the book yt is found. For great is the wrath of the
Lord that is f^llen upon us, because our fathers kept not the word of the
Lord,

And they brought the king word again. Then the king sent and gathered
together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. And the king went up into the
house of the Lord, and all the men of Judah and the inhabiters of Jerusalem and
the preastes and Levites and all the people great and small: and

And he made to come forth all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin, and
the inhabiters of Jerusalem promised to keep the covenant of ye God which was
the God of their fathers. And Josias put away al manner abhominacions out of all
lands that pertayned to the children of Israel, and brought all that were
found in Israel to serve the Lord their God. And they turned not a side
from the Lord God of their fathers as long as he lived.

sanctified unto the Lord: put the holy arcke in the house which Solomon the
son of David king of Israel did build, ye need not to bear it upon your
shoulders. Wherefore now serve the Lord your God and his people Israel. And
prepare your selves by your ancient housholdes and companyes, according to

After all this, iiii. Re.xxiii. f
when Josias had fynysshed the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight
against Carcamis upon Euphrates, and Josias went out against him. And the
other sent messengers to him, saying: what have I to do with the thou king of
Judah? I came not against the now at this time, but against an house with whom
I have war, and God bad me haste. Leave therefore and meddle not with God which
is with me, least he destroy the. Nevertheless Josias turned not his face from
him, but made him ready to fight with him, and herkened not unto the words of
Necho out of the mouth of God. And when he was come to fight in the valeye of
Magedo, ye shoters shot against the king Josias. And ye king said to his
servants: carry me away, for I am sore hurt. And his servants had him out
of that charet and put him in an other, and brought him to Jerusalem where he
dyed and was buried in ye sepulcher of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem
mourned for Josias. And Ieremye lamented Josias, and all singynge men and

the king of Egypt made Eliakim Eliakim.

commanded to make search: and it is found, that this city of old has made
insurrection against kings, and how that sedicion and rebellion has been
committed therein. There have been mighty kings also at Jerusalem, which have
reigned over all that is beyond the water, and toll, tribute and yearly
custom was given them. Do ye now after this commandment, forbid the same

This is the copye of the letters that Thathanai Captain on this side the
water, and Stharbuzanai, and their adherentes of Apharsach (which were on this

these: Unto Darius the king All peax. Be it known to the king, that we came

Sasbazar and laid the foundation of ye house of God at Jerusalem. Sithe^s that
time has it been in buyldinge, and as yet is not fynysshed. Now therefore if
it like the king, let search be made in the kings treasure house at Babylon,
whether it was king Cyrus commandment, that the house of God at Jerusalem

a foundation of three skore cubits high, and three skore cubytes broad, and
three walls of roughe stones, and one wall of timber, and the expenses should

God (which Nabuchodonozor took out of the temple at Jerusalem, and brought
unto Babylon) should be restored again, that they may be brought unto the
temple at Jerusalem to their place into the house of God.

Now therefore thou Thathanai captain

And let them offer sweet sauoures unto the God of heaven, and pray for the
kings life, and for his children. This commandment have I given. And what

should deal faithfully every day as was according.

And Pathaia the son of Mesesabel of ye children of Zarah the son of Judah
next the king in all matters concerning the people and their villages, through
out all their regions. And ye children of Judah that were without in the towns
of their land, dwelte some at Kariath Arbe, and in the villages thereof, and at
Dibon, and in the villages thereof: and at Cabzeel, and in the villages thereof
and at Iesua, Molada, Bethphalet, Hazersual, Bersabe and in their villages: and
at Sikelag and Moconah, and in their villages: And at Entemon, Zarah, Ierimuth,
Zonoah, Odolla^ and in their villages: At Lachis, and in the feldes thereof: At
Asekah, and in the villages thereof: and dwelt from Bersabe unto the valley of
Hennom.

The children of Benjamin of Gaba, dwelt at Machmas, Aia, Bethel and in their
villages. And at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, Hazor, Ramah, Gethaim, Hadid, Zeboim,
Nabalath, Lod, Ono and in the carpenters valley. And certain of the Levites
that had porcions in Judah, dwelt in Benjamin.

The prestes and Levites which came with Z^robabel to Jerusalem are numbered:
and the wall is dedycate.

CAPI. XII.
THese are the preastes and Levites that went up with Zorobabel the son of

Iesua begat Ioakim. Ioakim begat Eliasib. Eliasib begat Ioiada. Ioiada begat
Jonathan. Jonathan begat Iadua. And in the time of Ioakim were these the chief
fathers among the Preastes: under Saraiah, Maraiah, under Jeremy, Hananiah:
under Esdras Mosolam: under Amariah, Ioanan: under Milico, Jonathan: under
Sebaniah, Joseph under Harim, Edna: under Maraioth, Helcai: under Adia,
Zachary, under Genthon, Mosolam: under Abia, Zechri: under Miniamin and Moadia,
Peltai: under Belga, Samua: under Semeiah, Jonathan: under Iofarib, Mathuai:
under Iadaiah, Vsi: under Selai, Kelai: under Amok, Eber: under Helkia,
Hasabiah: under Iadaiah, Nathanael.

And in the time of Eliasib. Ioiada, Iohanan and Iadua, were the chief fathers
among the Levites, and the preastes written under ye raygne of Darius the
Persian. The children of Leui the principal fathers were written in the
Chronycles, until the time of Ionatha^ the son of Eliasib. And these were
the chief among the Levites, Hasabiah, Serebiah and Iesua the son of
Cadmiel, and their brethren over against them, to give praise and thanks
according as David the man of God had ordained it, one watch over against an
other. Mathania, Balbukiah, Obadiah, Mosolam Talmon and Abub were porters in
the watch at the thresholdes of ye gates. These were in the time of Ioakim the
son of Iesua the son of Iosedec, and in the time of Nehemi as the Captain
and of the pressed Esdras the scrybe.

And in the dedication of the wall at Jerusalem, were the Levites sought out of
al their and from the vyllages of Nethophathi, and from the house of Galgal,
and out of the feldes of Geba and Asmaueth: for the singers had builded them
villages about Jerusalem. And the prestes and Levites purified them selves, and
cleansed the people, the gates and the wall.



And Esdras the scribe before them, toward the Welgate, and they went up over
against them upon the steps of the cyty of David at the going up of the wall
to the house of David, unto the Watergate eastwarde.

The other queer of thankesgyuynge went over against them, and I after them,
and the half part of the people upon the wall, toward Fornacegate upward,
until the broad wall,

And the same day were there great sacrifices offered, and they reioysed: for
God had given them great gladness, so that both the wives and children were
joyful, and the myrthe of Jerusalem was herd far of.

At the same time were men appointed over the treasure chestes (wherein were the
offeringes, firstfrutes, and the tithes) that they should gather them out of the
feldes about the cities to deal them unto the preastes and Levites, according
to the law: for Judah was glad of the preastes, and Levites, that they stood and
waited upon the office of their God, and the office of the cleansing. And the
singers and porters stood after the commandment of David and of Solomon his
son: for in the time of David and Asaph, were the chief singers founded, i.
Par.xxiiii. a.
and the songs of praise and thankesgyuynge unto God. In the time of Zorobabel
and Nehemias, did all Israel, give porcions unto the singers and porters, every
day his portion, and they gave things hallowed unto the Levites, and the
Levites gave things that were sanctified, unto the children of Aaron.

Deuteronomye is read, and when they have heard it, they severed from them
all strangers. etc.

CAPI. XIII.
ANd what time as the book of Moses (...)
that the Ammonites and Moabites should never come into the congregation of
God, because they met not the children of Israel with bred and water, and hired
Balaam against them, (...)
that he should curse them: nevertheless our God turned the curse into a
blessinge. Now when they herd the Law, they severed from Israel every one
that had myxte him self therein. And before this had the preaste Eliasib
delivered the chest of the house of our God unto his kynsman Tobiah: for he had
made him a great chest and there had they before time laid the offerynges,
frankincense, vessel, and the tithes of corn, wine and oil (according to
the commandment given to the Levites, fyngers and porters) and the first
fruits of the preastes.

But in all this was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtyeth year of
Artaxerxes king of Babylon, came I unto the king and after certain days I
got license of the king to come to Jerusalem. And I gat knowledge of the evil
that Eliasib did unto Tobiah, in that he had made him a chest in the court
of the house of God, and it grieved me sore, and I cast forth all the vessels of
ye house

And I perceived, that the porcions of the Levites were not given them, for
which cause the Levites and singers were fled, every one to his land for to
work. Then reproved I the rulers, and said: Why forsake we the house of God?
But I gathered them together, and set them in their place. Then brought all
Judah the tithes of corn, wine and oil unto ye treasure. And we ordained to be
treasurours over the treasure, even Selemiah the preast, and Zadoc the scrybe,
and of the Levites Phadaiah and under their hand Hanan the son of Zacur the
son of Mathaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to
distribute unto their brethren. Think upon me O my God herein, (...)
and wype not out my mercy, that I have showed on the house of my God, and on
the officers thereof.

At the same time saw I some treading wine presses on the Sabbath and
bringynge in clustres, and asses laden with wine, grapes fygges, and bringing
all manner of burdens unto Jerusalem, upon the Sabbath day. And I rebuked them
earnestly the same day that they sold the vytayles. There dwelt me^ of Tire
also therein, which brought fysshe

And it fortuned, that when the gates of Jerusalem were touched with the
evening shadow on the Sabbath, I commanded to shut the gates, and charged
that they should not be opened till after the Saboth: and some of my servants
set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the Sabbath
day. Then remained the chapmen and merchants ones or twyse over night with
out Jerusalem, with all manner of wares. Then reproved I them sore, and said
unto them: why tarry ye all night about ye wall? If ye do it ones again, I
will lay hands upon you. From that time forth came they no more on the
Saboth. And I said unto the Levites which were clean, that they should come
and keep the gates, to halow the Sabbath day. Think upon me (O my God)
concerning this also, and spare me according to thy great mercy.

And at the same time saw I Jews, that married wives of Asdod, Ammon and of
Moab, and their children spoke half in the speech of Asdod, and could not
speak in the Jews language, but by the tongue might a man perceive iii.
Regu^.iii. b
Did not Solomon the king of Israel sin therein? and yet among many Panymes
was there no king like him, and he was dear unto his God, and God made him
king over al Israel, and yet nevertheless strange women caused him to sin?
And shall we then obey unto you, to do all this great evil, to halte before
our God, and mary strange wives?

And one of the children of Ioiada the son of Eliasib the high preast, had
made a contract with Sanabalat the Heronite: but I chaced him from me. O my
God, think thou upon them that defyle preasthode, and ye law of the preasthode
and of the Levites. Thus cleansed I them from all such as were strangers, and
appointed the courses of the preastes and Levites, every one to his office, and
to offer the wood at times appointed, and the first fruits. Think thou upon
me (O my God) for the best.

King Asuerus, which is called Artaxerxes makes a royal feast, whereunto
the queen Vasthi will not come: for which cause she is divorced.

CAPI. I.


And when these days were ended, ye king made a feast unto all the people
that were in the castle of Susan, both unto great and small, seven days long
in the court of the garden

The benches were of gold and silver made upon a pauement of grene, white,
yelow and black Marble. And the drink was carried in vessels of gold, and
there was ever change of vessel. And the kings wine was eyceding much,
according to the great power of the king. And no man was appointed what he
should drink: for the king had commanded all the officers of his house, that
every one should do as it lyked him, And the queen Vasthi made a feast also
for the women in the palace of Asuerus. And on the.vij. day when the king was
pleasauntly mety of the wine he commanded Mehuman, Bartha, Harbona,

And that this writing of the king which shall be made, be publysshed through
out all his empire which is great, that all wives may have their husbands in
honor, both great and small. This pleased ye king and the princes, and the
king did according to the word of Mamucan. The (...)
Then were letters sent forth into all the kings lands, into every land
according to the wrytinge thereof, and to entry people after their language,
that every man should be Lord and chief in his own house. And this caused he
to be diuulged among all people.

The queen put away, certain goodly young damoselles are searched out
among whom Esther pleases the king, Mardocheus discloseth to the king
those that would vetraye him.

CAP. II.
THese things done when the displeasure

In the castle of Susan there was a Jew, whose name was Mardocheus, the son of
Iair, the son of Semei, the son of Cis, the son of Iemini, (...)
which was carried away from Jerusalem, when Iekonias the king of Judah was led
away, whom Nabuchodonozor king of Babylon carried away) and he norysshed
Hadasah, otherwise called Esther, his uncles daughter: for she had neither
father nor mother, and she was a fair and bewtyfull damsel.

Now when the kings commandment was publyshed, and according to it many
damsels were brought to gyther unto the castle of Susan under the hand of
Hagei, Esther was taken also unto the kings house under the hand of Hagei the
keeper of the women, and the damsel pleased him, and she found grace in his
sight. And he caused her ointment to be given her, and her gifts, and gave her
seven notable gentyl women of the kings house, and arrayed both her and her
gentyllwemen very rychely in the house of the women. But Esther showed not her
people nor her kynred: for Mardocheus had charged her, that she should not tell
it. And Mardocheus walked every day before the court of the wemens buyldinge,
that he might know how Esther did, and what should become of her. And when the
appointed time of every damsel came that she should come to the king Asuerus,
after that she had been.xij. months in the deckynge of the women (for their
deckynge must have so much time, namely.vj. months with Balm and Myrre,
and.vj. months with good spices, so were the women bewtyfyed) then went there
one damsel unto the king, and what so ever she required that must be given her
to go with her out of the wemens buyldinge unto the kings palace. And when one
came in the evening, the same went from him on the morrow into ye second
house of women, under the hand of Sasagas the kings chamberlayne, which

Now when the time came of Esther the daughter of Abihail Mardocheus uncle
(who^ he had received as his own daughter) that she should come to the king,
she desired nothing but what Hagei the kings chamberlayne the keeper of the
women said. And Esther found favor in the sight of all them that looked upon
her. So Esther was taken unto king Asuerus into the house royal, in ye tenth
month which is called Tebeth, in the vij. year of his raygne.

And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she found grace and mercy
in his sight before all the virgins: and he set: the

And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mardocheus sat
in the kings gate. And as yet had not Esther showed her kynred and her
people, according as Mardocheus had bydden her: for Esther did after the word
or Mardocheus, like as when he was her tutoure. At the same time while
Mardocheus sat in the kings gate, two of the kings chamberlaynes Bagathan
and Thares which kept the door were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the
king Asuerus: whereof Mardocheus gat knowledge, and told it unto queen Esther,
and Esther certyfyed ye king thereof in Mardocheus name. And when inquyrye was
made, it was found so. And they were both hanged on tree: and it was written in
the Chronycles, before the king.

Haman obtained of the king that all Jews should be put to death because
Mardocheus had not given him worship, as other had.

CAPI. III.
AFter this the king promoted Haman

In the.j. month (that is the month Nisan) in the.xij. year of king Asuerus,
they cast Pour (that is a lot) before Haman, on what day and what month this
should be done: and there came out the.xii. month that is ye month Abar. And
Haman said unto king Asuerus: There is a people scatered abroad and

Then were the kings scribes called on ye xiij. day of the first month, and
there was written (according as Haman commanded) unto the kings princes and
to the captyues every where in the lands, and to the rulars of every people in
the cou^treyes on every side, according to the wrytinge of every nation, and
after their language in the name of king Asuerus, and sealed with the kings
ring. And the wrytinges were sent by pursyuau^tes into all the kings lands,
to rote out: to kyl and to destroy al Jews, both young and old, children and
women in one day, that is to wite upon the thirtenth day of the twelueth
month, which is the month Adar and to spoil their goods.

This was the sum of the lettres, that there should be a commandment given
in all lands, to be publysshed unto all people, that they should be ready
against the same day. And the purseuauntes went in all the haste according
to the kings commandment. And in the castle of Susan was ye commandment
devised. And the king and Haman sat and drank. But the city of Susan was
disquieted.

Mardocheus gives the queen knowledge of the cruel decr^e of the king
against the Jews.

CAPI. IIII.


And Mardocheus told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum
of silver that Haman had promised to weye down in the kings chamber because of
the Jews for to destroy them, and he gave him the copy of the commandment,
that was devised at Susan to destroy them, that he might show it unto Esther,
and to speak to her and charge her, that she should go in to the king, and
make her prayer and supplication unto him for her people.

And when Hathath came in, and told Esther the words of Mardocheus, Esther
spoke unto Hathath, and commanded him to say unto Mardocheus: all the kings
servants,

And when Mardocheus was certyfyed of Esthers words, Mardocheus bad say again
unto Esther: think not to save thine own life, while thou art in the kings
house before all Jews: for if thou holdeste thy peax at this time, then shall
the Jews have help
Esther bad, give Mardocheus this answer: go thou thy way, and gather together
all the Jews that are found at Susan, and fast ye for me, that ye eat not
and drink not in three days, neither day nor night. I and my damoselles will
fast likewise, and so will I go in to the king contrary to the commandment:
if I perysshe, I perysshe. So Mardocheus went his way, and did all that
Esther had commanded him.

Esther enters in to the king and byddeth him and Haman to a feast. Haman
prepares a galou^e for Mardocheus.

CAPI. V.
ON the third day put Esther on her royal apparel, and stood in the court of
ye

Now when the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared, ye
king said unto Esther after he had largely drunk of the wine: Esther, what
is thy petition? and it shall be given the. And what requirest thou? If it be
even the half of the empire, it shall be done.

Then answered Esther and said: my peticion and desire is, if I have found
grace (...)

Then went Haman forth the same day, joyful and merry in his mind. And when
he saw Mardocheus in the kings gate, that be stood not up and kneled before
him, he was full of indignacion at Mardocheus. Nevertheless he refrayned him
self: and when became home, he sent, and called for his friends and Zares his
wife, and told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his
children all to gyther, how the king had promoted him so greatly, and how
that he was taken above the princes and servants

The king turns over the Chronycles and finds the fydelytye of Mardocheus:
and then to the confusion of Haman, he commands Mardocheus to be had in
honor. CAPI. VI.
THe same night could not ye king stepe, and he commanded to bring the
Chronicles and histories:
which when they were red before the king they happened on the place where it
was written, how Mardocheus had told, that the kings two chamberlaynes (which
kept ye thressholdes) sought to lay hands on king Asuerus. And ye king
said: what worship and good have we done

The king said: make haste, and take as thou have said, the raiment and the
horse^ and do even so with Mardocheus the Jew that sits before the kings
gate, and let nothing fail of all that thou have spoken. Then took Haman the
raiment and the horse, and arrayed him, and brought him on horsbacke through the
street of the cite, and proclaimed before him: Even thus shall it be done unto
every man whom the king is disposed to honor. And Mardocheus came again to
the

The queen byddeth the king and Haman again, and prays for her self and her
people. She accuses Haman: and he is hanged on the galouse, which he had
prepared for Mardocheus.

CAPI. VII.
ANd when the king and Haman came

And when the king came again out of ye palace garden into the parler where
they had eaten, Haman had laid him upon the bed that Esther sat upon. Then
said the king, that spoke good for the king. The king said: hang him
thereon. So they hanged Hama^ on the galowes that he had made for Mardocheus. So
was the kings wrath appeaced.

After the death of Hama^ Mardocheus is promoted then are comfortable letters
sent unto the Jews.

CAPI. VIII.


Then said the king Asuerus unto queen Esther, and to Mardocheus the Jew:
Behold I have given Esther the house of Haman,

And it was written according as Mardocheus commanded unto the Jews and to
the princes, to the deputyes and capitaynes in the lands from Ind until
Ethiopia, namely an hundred and seven and twentye lands, unto every one
according to the wryttynge thereof, unto every people after their speech, and
to the Jews according to

The sum of the wryttynge was, how there was a commandment given in all
lands to be publyshed unto all the people, yt the Jews should be redye
against that day to avenge them selves on their enemies. And the messaungers
that bare the tydinges went forth with all speed, according to the kings
word: and the commandment was devised in the castle of Susan.

And Mardocheus went out from ye king in royal apparel of yelowe and white and
with a great crown of gold, arrayed with a garment of lynnen and purple, and
the city of Susan rejoiced and was glad: but unto the Jews there was come
light and gladness and joy and worship. And in all lands and cytyes, in to
what places soever the kings word and commandment reached, there was joy
and mirth, prosperity and good days among the Jews: in so much that many
of the people in the land became of the Jews belefe, for the fear of the
Jews came upon them.

At commandment of the king, the Jews put their foos to death. The sons of
Haman are hanged. The Jews keep a feastfull day in remembrance of their
delyuerye.

CAPI. XI.
IN the twelfte month (that is the month

Thus the Jews smote all their enemies lands of the king? What is thy
request, that it may be given the? and what requyrest thou more to be done?
Esther said: If it please the king, let him suffer the Jews to morrow also
to do according unto this days commandment, that they hang Hamans ten
sons upon the tree. And the king charged to do so, and the commandment was
devised at Susan, and Hamans ten sons were hanged. And the Jews gathered
them selves to gyther at Susan, upon the fourtenth day of the month Adar, and
slew three hundredth men at Susan, but their gods they would not spoil.

Moreover the other Jews in the kings lands, stood for their lives, and ga^

and their sorrow into prosperity: yt they should observe the same as days of
welthe and gladness,
and one to send gifts unto an other, and to distribute unto the pore.

And the Jews received all that they had begone to do, and that Mardocheus had
wryte^ unto them: how that Haman the son of Hamadatha ennemy to all the Jews,
had devised to destroy all the Jews, and caused to cast Phur (that is Lot)
for to put them in fear, and Phurim.
after the name of Phur according to all the words of this wry^ing: and what
they them selves had sent, and what had happened unto them.

And the Jews set it up, and took it upon them and their sede, and upon all
such as joined them selves unto them, that they would not mysse to keep these
two days yearly, according as they were written and appointed, how these days
are not to be forgotten, but to be kept of childrens children among al
kynredes in all lands and cyt^es. These are the days of Phurim yt is to say
of ^o^res, which

And queen Hester the daughter of Abihail and Mardocheus the Jew wrote with all
authority, to confirm this second wrytinge of Phurim, and sent the letters
unto all the Jews in the.c. and.xxvij.lands of the empire of Asuerus, with
friendly and faithful words to confirm these days of Phurim, in their time
appointed, according as Mardocheus ye Jew and Esther the queen had ordained
in that behalf: like as the / upon their soul and upon their sede had
confirmed the acts of the Hester.iiii.c

acts of this Phurim, and to write them in a book.

Even so are ye also come unto me: but now that ye se my myserye, ye are
afraid. Did I desire you, to come hither? Or, to give me any of your
substance? To deliver me from the enemies hand, or to save me from the
power of the mighty? Teach me and I will hold my tongue: and if I do err,
show me wherein.

Wherefore blame ye then the words, that are well and truly spoken? which of
you can reprove them? Saving only that ye are sotyll to check men's sayenges,
and can speak many words in the wind. Ye fall upon the fatherless, and go
about to overthrow your own friend. Wherefore look not only upon me, but upon
your selves: whether I lie, or no. Turn into your own selves (I pray you) be
indifferent judges, and consydre mine vngyltynes: whether there be any
vnryghtousnesse in my tongue, or vain words in my mouth.

Job shows that this life is but a battle, or warfare.

Why go thou not fro me, ne let me alone, so long till I swalowe down
my spettle? I have offended, what shall I do unto the, O thou preserver of

unto my self? Why do thou not forgive me my sin? Wherefore take thou not
away my wickedness? Behold, now must I sleep in the duste: and if thou
sekest me to morrow in the morning, I shall be gone.

Job is reprehended and noted to have deserved his pain. A descryp^ion of
hypocresye.

THen answered Baldad the Suhite, and Psalm.cxliii. a.

Job declares the benefytes of God, and how man's ryghtousnes is nothing.

CAP. IX.
Job answered and said: Certes I know it
If he will argue with him, he shall not be ha^^le to answer him, one among
a thousand. He is wise of heart, and mighty in strength. Who ever prospered,
that took part against him? He translateth the mountains, or ever they be a
ware, and overthrows them in his wrath. He remoueth the earth one of her
place, and her pylers, he all to spaketh. He commanded the son, and it
ryseth not: he closes up the sierres, as it were under a signet. He him self
alone spredeth out the heavens, and goes upon the waves of the sea. He makes
the veins of heaven, the Orions, the seven sterres, and the secret places of
the southe. He does great things, such as are unsearchable, yea and wonders
without nombre.

If he came by me, I might not look upon it. If he be hastye to take any
thing away, who shall make him restore it again? Who shall say unto him:
what do thou? He is God, whose wrath no man can withstand: but the
proudest of al must stoop under him? How should I then answer him? or what
words should I find out against hunt Yea, though I be ryghtous, yet will I
not give him one word again, but mekely submyt my self to my judge. All be
it that I call upon him, and he hear me, yet am I not sure that he has herd
my voice: he shall trouble me so with the tempest, and wound me out of measure
without cause. He shall not let my spirit be in rest, but fylleth me with
bitterness.

If men will speak of strength, he is the strongest of all, if men will
speak of ryghtousnesse,
who dare be my record? If I will

This one thing will I say: He destroys both the ryghtous and ungodly. And
though he slay suddenly with the scourge, yet laugheth he at the punishment of
the innocent. As for the world, he gives it over in to the power of the
wicked, such as the rulers be, whereof all lands are full. Is it not so? where
is there any but he is such one?

My days have been more swift then a purseuant: they are gone suddenly, and
have seen no good thing. They are passed away, as the ships that are good
under sail, and as the Egle that hastes to her pray. When I am purposed to
forget my complaynynges, to change my countenance, and to comfort my self:
then am I afraid of all my works, for I know thou fauourest not an evil
doer.

Job is weary of his life, and sets out his fraylty before God. He desires
time to repent. A descripcion of death.

CAPI. X.


Though thou hydest these things in thine heart: yet am I sure that thou
remembrest them all. Wherefore did thou keep me, when I sinned, and haste
not cleansed me fro mine offense? If I do wickedly, woe is me therefore: If I be
ryghtous, yet dare I not lift up my heed: so full am I of confusion, and se
mine own misery.

Thou huntest me out, oppressed with heaviness, as it were a Lion, and
troublest me beyond all measure. Thou bryngest fr^sshe witnesses against me,
thy wrath inceasest thou upon me: full many are the plages that I am in.
Wherefore haste thou brought me out of my mothers womb? O that I had

fear continually abides.

He caryeth away the wise men,
as it were a spoil and brings the judges out of their wits: He loses

the priests in to captivity, and turns the mighty up set down. He takes

Sorrow and carfulness make him afraid, and compass him round about, like

disceyued with vanite.

receive gifts. He conceyueth travail, he bears mischief, and his body

Far be it from God, that he should meddle with wickedness: and far be it from
the almighty, that he should meddle with vnrightous dealyng: but he rewards the
works of man and causes every man to find according to his ways. For sure
it is that God conde^neth no man wrongfully, and the judgment of the almighty
is not vnryghtous. Who rules the earth in his stead? Or whom has he set to
govern the hole world? To whom has he given his heart, for to draw his
spirit and breath unto him? All flesh shall come together unto naught, and
all men shall turn again unto earth. If thou now have vnderstndyryng hear
what I say, and harken to the voice of my words.

May he be made whole, that loves no right? If thou were a very innocent

Therefore turned they back traitorously and unfaithfully from him, and would not
receive his ways. In so much yt they have caused ye voice of the poor to come

As for the ungodly, he preserves them not but helps the poor to their

dissemblers, and hypocrites, they heap up wrath for them selves: for they call
not upon him, though they be his prysonners. Thus their soul peryssheth in
folly, and their life with the condemned. The poor delyuereth he out of his
straytnesse, and comfort such as be in necessity and trouble. Even so

governs he his people, and gives the^ abundance of meat. In the turnyng

THen Job answered the Lord, and said: Esaias.xxviii.c i: Regu^.xvi. b.
and that there is no thought hyde unto the. For who can keep his own counsel
so secret, but it shall be known? Therefore have I spoken unwisely, seeing
these things are so high, and pass mine understanding. O harken thou unto me
also, and let me speak: answer unto the thing that I will ask the. I have
given dylygent ear unto the, and now I se the with mine eyes. Wherefore I give
mine own self the blame, and take repentance, in the duste and ashes.

Now when the Lord had spoken these words unto Job, he said unto Eliphas
the is right before me, like as my servant Job has done. Therefore take seven
oxen and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, offer up also for your selves
a brentoffringe: and let my servant Job pray for you. Him will I accept,
Marcke.v.c.
and not deal with you after your folyshnesse: in that ye have not spoken ye

thousand sheep, fix thousand Camels, a thousand (...) yoke of oxen, and a
thousand asses. He h^^ children also, seven sons and three daughters. The
first called Day: the second Pouerte: the third All plenteousnes. In all the
land were none found so fair, as the daughters of Job, and their father gave
them enheritaunce among their brethren. After this lived Job fourtye years, so
that he saw his children, and his childrens children to the fourth generation.
And so he dyed, being old and of a perfect age.

PSALM. I.

Not so with the ungodly, not so but they are like dust, which the wind

Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in ye judgment, neither the sinners in

PSALM. VIII. To the chaunter upon Githith, a Psalm of David.
O Lord our governor: how wonderful

Out of the mouth of the very babes and sucklynges thou have ordained praise,
because of thine enemies, that thou myghtest destroy the ennemy and the
auenger.

For I consydre thy heavens, even ye work of thy fingers: the moon and the
stars which thou have made.

What is man, that thou art so myndefull of him? either the son of man that

After thou had for a season made him lower then the angels, thou
crownedst him with honor and glory.

Thou have set him above the works of thy hands: and thou have put al things
in subjection under his fete.

All sheep and oxen, yea the beasts of the field.

The fowls of the air, the fisshe of the sea, and what so ever walks through
the ways of the sea.

O Lord our governor, how wonderful is thy name in all the world?

PSALM. IX. To the chaunter upon Almuth Laben, a Psalm of David.
I Will give thanks unto the (O Lord) with my hole heart, I will speak of al

I will be glad, and rejoice in the, yea my songs will I make of thy name, O
thou most high.

Because thou haste driven mine enemies back, they were disconsyted, and
perysshed at thy presence.

For thou have maynteyned my right and my cause: thou sit in the throne
that art the true judge.

Thou rebukest the heythen, and destroyest the ungodly, thou put out their

enemies, thou that lyftest me up from the gates of death.



But the Heythen, are suncken down in the pyt that they made: in the same
net which they spread out pryuely, is their own feet taken.

Thus the Lord is known to execute true judgment, when the ungodly is
trapped in the works of his own hands, Selah.



But the pore shall not always be out of remembrance, the pacient abydinge of
such as be in trouble shall not perysh for ever.

His ways are always filthy, thy judgments are far out of his sight, he
defyeth all his enemies.

For he says in his heart: Tush, I shall never be cast down, there shall no
harm happen unto me.

His mouth is full of cursinge, fraud and disceyte: under his tongue is
travail and sorrow.

He sits lurkyng in the gardens, that he may pryuely murder the innocent,

He lies in awayte secretly, as it were a lion in his den.

He lurketh that he may rauysh the poor, yea to rauysh the pore, when he

Then smyteth he, then oppresses he and casts down the pore with his
auctorite.

For he says in his heart: Tush, God has forgotten, he has turned away his
face, so that he will never se it.

Arise O Lord God, lift up thine hand, and forget not the pore.

Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God and say in his heart: tush, he
cares not for it.

This thou seyst, for thou considrest the mysery and sorrow.

The pore gives him self over into thy hand and commits him unto the, for

which he has done, that he may perysh.

that thine ear herkeneth thereto.

Help the fatherless and poor unto their right, that the ungodly be no more
exalted upon earth.

PSALM. X. After the Hebrews.xi.
To the chaunter, of David.


For so, the ungodly have bent their bow, and made redye their arowes in the

The very foundation have they cast down what can the ryghteous then do with
all?

Abat.i. d
He consydereth it with his eyes, his eye lyddes behold the children of men.

The Lord seyth both the ryghteous and ungodly, but who so delyteth in
wickedness, him his soul abhors.

Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire brymstone, storm and tempest:
this reward shall they have to drink.

For the Lord is ryghteous, and he loves ryghteousnes: his countenance
beholds the thing that is just.

To the chaunter of David servant of the Lord which said unto the Lord the

hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul, and said.
I Will love the (O Lord) my strength.

The Lord is my succor, my refuge, my Savior: my God, my help in whom I
trust: my buckler, the horn of my health, Heb.ii. ^

I will praise the Lord, and call upon him, so shall I be safe from mine

The sorrows of death compassed me, and the brokes of ungodliness made me
afraid.

The pains of hell came about me, ye snares of death took hold upon me.

Yet in my trouble I called upon the Lord, and complained unto my God.

So he herd my voice out of his holy temple, and my complaynte came before
him, eue^ into his ears.

Then the earth trembled and quaked, the very foundacions of the hills shoke
and were removed, because he was wroth.

There went a smoke out of his nostrelles and a consuminge fire out of his
mouth, so that coals were kyndled at it.

He bowed the heavens and came down, and it was darcke under his fete.

He rode upon the Cherubyns and did fle: he came flyenge with the wings of the
wind.

He made darkness his pauylyon rou^dabout him, with darcke water and thick
clouds to cover him.

At the brightness of his presence the clouds removed, with hayle stones and
coals of fire.

The Lord also thondred out of the heaven and the heygth gave his thondre with
hayle stones and coals of fire.

He sent out his arowes and scatered them, he cast sore lyghtenynges, and
destroyed them.

The springes of waters were seen, and the foundacyons of the round world
were discovered at thy chyding (O Lord) at the blastynge and breath of thy
displeasures.

He sent down from the beygth to fetch

He delivered me from my strong enemies, and from my foes which were to
mighty for me.

They prevented me in the time of my trouble, but the Lord was my defense.

He brought me forth also into liberty: and delivered me, because he had a
favor unto me.

The Lord shall reward me after my ryghteous dealing, and according to the
clennesse of my hands shall he recompense me.

For I have kept the ways of the Lord: and have not behaved my self wyckedly
against my God.

I have an eye unto all his laws, and cast not out his commandments from
me.



Therefore shall the Lord reward me after my ryghtuous dealing, and according
unto the clennesse of my hands in his eye sight.

With the holy thou shall be holy, and with the innocent thou shall be innocent.

With the clean thou shall be clean, and with the froward thou shall be
froward.

For thou shall save the pore oppressed, and bring down the high lokes of
the proud.

Thou ^ightest my candle, O Lord my God


For in the I can discomfort an host of men: yea in my God I can leap over the
wall.

The way of God is a perfect way: the words of the Lord are tried in the
fire: he is a shylde of defense, for all them that trust in him.

For who is God, but the Lord? Or, who has any strength, but our God?

It is God that gyrded me with strength, and made my way vncorrupt.

He has made my fete like hertes fete, and set me up on high.

He teaches mine hands to fight, and makes mine arms to break even a bow
of stele. i. Regu^.xxii.c


Thou have given me the defense of thy health thy righthande vpholdeth me, and
thy loving correction makes me great.

Thou have made rowme enough under me for to goo, that my foot steps should
not slide.

I will follow upon mine enemies, and take them: I will not turn till they be
discomforted.

I will smite them, they shall not be hable to stand, but fall under my fete.



Thou have made mine enemies to turn their backs upon me, thou have
destroyed the^ that hated m^.

They cried, but there was none to help them: yea even unto the Lord, but he
herd them not.

I will beat them as small as the dust clay in the wind, I will cast them out

Thou shall deliver me from the stryninges of the people, thou shall make me

A people whom I have not known shall serve me.

As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me, but the strange children
dissemble with me.

The strange children are waxen old, and go haltinge out of their paths.

The Lord lives: and blessed be my helper,

Even the God which seyth that I be avenged, and subdueth the people unto me.

It is he that delyuereth me from my cruel enemies: thou shall lift me up

But for thy sake we are killed all the day long: and are counted as sheep
appointed to be slain.

For they are in no parell of death, but stand fast like a palace.

They come in no mysfortune like other folk, neither are they plaged like

And this the cause that they be so puffed up in pride, and overwhelmed with
cruelte and unrighteousness.

That their posterity might know it, and the children which were yet unborn.

To the intent that when they came up, they might show their children the same.

That they also might put their trust i^ God and not to forget what he had
done, but to keep his commandments.

And not to be as their forefathers, a froward and ouerthwarte generation, a
generation that set not their heart a right, and whose spirit was not true
toward God.



They kept not the covenant of God, and would not walk in his law.

They forgot what he had done, and the wonderful works that he had
showed for them.

Marvelous things did be in the sight of our fathers in the land of Egypt,
even in ye field of Zoan.

(...) xxi^.
He dyuyded the sea and let them goo through it, and made the waters to stand
like a wall.

In the day time he led them with a cloud and all the night through with a
light of fire.

(...)
He cloue the hard rocks in the wyldernes and gave them drink thereof, as it
had been out of the great deapth.

He brought waters out of the stony rock, so that they gusshed out like the
ryuers.

Yet for all this they sinned against him, and provoked the most highest in
the wilderness.

They tempted God in their hertes, and required

(...)
For they spoke against God, and said: yea yea, God shall prepare a table in
the wyldernes, shall he?

(...)
Lo, he smote the stony rock, that the watery streams gusshed out, and the
streams flowed with all: but how can he give bred and provide flesh for his
people?

When the Lord herd this, Nume.xx. ^
he was wroth so the fire was kyndled in Jacob, and heuye displeasure against
Israel.

Because they believed not in God, and put not their trust in his help.

So he commanded the clouds above, and opened the doors of heaven.

He rayned down Manna upon them for to eat, and gave them bred from heaven.
Exo.xvi.c Numer.xi. b.


Then ate they angels fode, for he sent the^ meat enough.

He caused the east wind to blow under ye heaven, i. Corin.x. ^
and through his power he brought in the south wind.

He made flesh to rain upon them as thick as dust, Numeri.xi. g
and fethered fowls like as the sand of the sea.

He let it fall among their tents roundeabout their habitations.

So they ate, and were filled, for he gave them their own desire.

They were not disappointed of their lust.

But while the meat was yet in their mouths: Numeri.xi. g.
the heavy wrath of God came upon them

But for all this they sinned yet more, and believed not his wondrous works.

Therefore their days were consumed in vanity, and suddenly their years were
gone.

When he slew them, they sought him, and turned them early unto God.

They thought then that God was their succoure, and that the high God was
their redemer.

Nevertheless they did but flatter him in their mouths, and dissembled with
him in their tongues.

For their heart was not hole with him, neither continued they in his covenant.

But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds, and destroyed them
not.

Yea many a time turned he his wrath away, and would not suffer his hole
displeasure to arise.

For he considered that they were but flesh: even a wind that passes away,
and comes not again.

O how often have they grieved him in ye wilderness?

How many a time have they provoked him in the deserte?

They turned back, and tempted God, and moved the holy one in Israel.

They thought not of his hand, in ye day when he delivered them from the
hand of the ennemy.

How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt, Exodi.i. ^
and his wondres in the land of Zoan.

How he turned their waters in to blood so that they might not drink of the
ryuers.

How he sent lyce among them, Exodusviii. ^.c
to eat the^ up, and frogs to destroy them.

How he gave their fruits unto the Casyr^^^^, and their labor unto the
Grashop^^^.

(...) he bet down their vyneyardes with ha^^^ stones, and their Mulbery trees
with the (...).

How he smote their catell with hayle stones, (...).vi. a.c.
and their flocks with hoote thonder boltes.

How he sent upon them the furyousnes of his wrath, anger and displeasure: with
trouble and falling in of evil angels.

When he made a way to his fearful indignacion, and spared not their souls
from death, yea and gave their catell over to the pestilence.

When he smote all the first borne in Egypt the most principal and myghtyest in
the dwellynges of Ham.

Exodi.xii. d. Exodi.xiiii. e.

He brought the^ out safely, that they should not fear, and overwhelmed their
enemies with the sea.

He carried the^ unto the borders of his Sanctuary: even in to this hyl, which
he purchased with his right hand.

Iosue.xiii. b.
He did cast out the Heythen before them, caused their land to be diuyded among
them for an heritage, and made the trybes of Israel to dwell in their tents.

For all this they tempted and displeased the most high God, and kept not his
covenant.

But turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers, startinge
aside like and broken bow.

And so they grieved him with their high places, and provoked him with their
images.

When God herd this, he was wroth, and took sore displeasure at Israel.

So that he forsook the tabernacle in Silo, even his habitation wherein he dwelt
among men. i. Regu^.iiii. a.


He delivered their power into captivity, and their glory into the enemies
hand.

He gave his people over into the sword,

The fire consumed their young men, and their maidens were not given to marriage.

Their prestes were slain with the sword, and there were no wydowes to make
lamentation.

So the Lord awaked as one out ^f slept and l^ke a g^af^e refresshed with
wine.

He smote his enemies in the hinder p^rtes, and put them to a perpetual shame.

He r^fused the ^ab^rnacle of Joseph, and those not the (...) of Eph^^^m.

So he fed them with a faithful and true heart, and ruled them with all the
diligence of his power.

For my days are consumed away like smoke: and my bones are brent up as it

My heart is smytten down, and wythered like grass: so that I forget to eat

For the voice of my groaning: my bone will fearer cleue to my flesh.

I am become like a Pellycane in the wilderness: and like an hose in a broken

I wake, and am even as it were a sparowe sitting alone upon the house top.



I eat ashes with my breed, and mingle my drink with wepinge.

And that because of thine indignacion and wrath, for thou have taken me up,
and cast me away.

My days are gone like a shadow: and I am withered like grass.

But thou, O Lord, endurest for ever: and thy remembrance through out all
generacyons.

Arise therefore and have mercy upon Sion: for it is time to have mercy upon
her, yea the time is come.

behold the earth.

That he may hear the mourninges of such as be in captivity: and deliver the
children of death.

That they may preach the name of the Lord in Syon: and his worship at
Jerusalem.

When the people are gathered together:

He has brought down my strength in my journey: and shortened my days.

Yet will I say. O my God, take me not away in the myddest of mine age: as
for thy years, they endure through out all generacions.

The Lord executes rightousnesse and judgment, for all them that suffer

The Lord is full of compassion and mercy: long sufferynge, and of great

He will not always be chiding: neither will he keep his anger for ever.

He has not dealte with us after our sins: ne rewarded us according to
our wickedness.

For look how hye the heaven is in comparion of the earth: so great is his mercy
also toward them that fear him.

Look how wide the East is from the Weste: so far has he set our
sins from us.

Yea like as a father pitieth his own children:

For he knows whereof we be made: he remembers that we are but dust.

That a man in his time is but as is grass: and florissheth as a flower of the

Thou haste set them their bounds, which they may not pass, that they turn

Thou causest the wells to spring up among the valeys, and the waters to

That al bestes of the feld may have drink, and that the wild asses may
quench their thirst.

Above upon the hills have the fowls of ye air their habitacion, and sing
among the branches.

Thou waterest the hills from above: the earth is filled with the fruits of

Thou bryngest forth grass for the catel, and grene herbs for the service of

Thou bring fode out of the earth: wine to make glad the heart of man, oil to
make him a chereful countenance, and breed to strenegth man's heart.

The trees of the Lord are full of say: even the trees of Libanus which he
has planted.

There make the birds their nestes: and the fyrre hills are a dwelling for
the Storcke.

The hills are a refuge for the wild gotes: and so are the stonye rocks for
the conyes.

Thou haste appointed the Moon for certain seasons, the Sun knows his

Thou make darcknesse, that it may be night: wherein all the beestes of the
forest do move.

Yea and the young Lions which rore after their pray: and seek their meat
at God.

But when the sun aryseth, they get them away together, and lie them down
in their dens.

They wait all upon the, that thou may give them meat in due season.

When thou gyuest it them, they gather it: when thou openest thine hand, they
are filled with good.

But when thou hydest thy face, they are sorrowful: if thou take away their
brethe, they dye, and are turned again to their dust.

Again, when thou let thy breath go forth, they are made: and so thou
renuest the face of the earth.

The glorious majesty of the Lord endures for ever: and the Lord reioyseth
in his works.

The earth trembles at the look of him: he both but touch the hills, and

Then sent the king, and caused him to be delivered: the prince of the people

He made him Lord of his house: and rul^^ of all his substance.

That he might inform his princes after his will: and teach his senators

Israel also came in to Egypt: and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.

But he increased his people excedingly: and made them stronger then their

Whose heart turned so, that they hated his people: and dealte untruly with

Then sent he Moses his servant, and Aaron: whom he had chosen.

They forgot God their savior, which had done so great things in Egypt.

So he said he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stand

But murmured in their tents, and harkened not unto the voice of the Lord.

Because they provoked his spirit, and he told them plainly with his lyppes.

Neither destroyed they the Heithen: as the Lord commanded them.

But were myngled among the Heithen: and learned their works.

In so much that they worshypped their images: which turned to their own
decay.

Yea they offered their sons and daughters unto deuyls.

And shed the innocent blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they
offered unto the images of Canaan: so that the land was defiled with blood.

Thus were they stained with their own works, and went a hooring with their

Therefore was the wrath of ye Lord kindled against his people, in so much that

For the love that I had unto them, they take now my contrary part, but I

helpless, and him that was vexed at the heart, to slaye him.

His delight was in cursing, and therefore shall it happen unto him: he loved not
blessing, and

Help me, O Lord my God, oh save me for thy mercyes sake.

That they may know, how that this is thy hand, and that thou have done it.

Though they curse, yet bless thou: and let them be confounded, that rise up
against me, but let thy servant rejoice.

Let mine adversaries be clothed with their own shame, as with a cloak.

We will go in to his tabernacle, and fall down before his fotestole.

If thy children will keep my covenant, and Luc.i. e Act.ii. e

This shall be my rest, here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein.

I will bless her vytayles with increase, and will satisfy her pore with bred.

mother, he ta^ ht me also, saying:

Let thine heart receive my words: keep my commandments, and thou shalt
live.

Get the wisdom, get the understanding forget not the words of my mouth, and
shrynke not from them.

Forsake not her, and she shall preserve the: love her, and she shall keep the.

The chyefe point of wisdom is, that thou be willing to obtain wisdom, and

Make much of her, and she shall promote there yea if thou embrace her, she shall
bring the unto honor.

She shall make the a gracyous heed: and garnysshe the with and crown of
glory.

Hear my son, and receive my words: that the years of thy life may be
many.

I will show the, the way of wisdom, and led the in the right paths.

So that if thou go therein, there shall no straytnesse hyndre the: and when
thou runnest, thou shall not fall.

Take fast hold of doctrine, let her not go: keep her, for she is thy life.

Come not in the pathe of the ungodly, and

Eschew it, and go not therein: depart aside, and pass over by it.

For they can not sleep, except they have first done some myschyefe: neither
take they any rest, except they have first done some harm.

For they eat the breed of wickedness, and drink the wine of robbery.

The pathe of the rightous shyneth as the light, and is ever brighter and
bryghter unto the perfect day.

But the way of the ungodly is as the

My son, mark my words, and enclyne thine ear unto my sayings.

Let them not depart from thine eyes: keep them even in the myddest of thine

For they are life unto all those that find them: and health unto all their

Repe thine here with all diligence: for thereupon hangs life.

Put away from the a froward mouth: and let the lyppes of sclaunder be
far from the.

Let thine eyes behold the thing that is eight: and let thine eye lyddes look

Turn not a side, neither to the right hand, ne to the left, but withholde

O My son, give head unto my wysdom,


For the lyppes of an harlot are a droppynge honye comb, Hor^dome.
and her throat is softer then oil.

But at the last, she is as bitter as wormewod, and as sharp as a two edged
sword.

Her fete go down unto death, and her steps pearse through unto hell.

She regards not the pathe of life, so unsteadfast

Hear me therefore (o my son) and depart not from the words of my mouth.

Keep thy way far from her, and come not nigh the doors of her house.

That thou give not thine honor unto an other, and thy years to the cruel.

That other men be not filled with thy goods: and that thy labors come not
in a strange house.

Yea that thou mourn not at the last (when thou have spent thy body and
goods) and then say:

Alas, why hated I nourtoure? why did my heart despise correction?

Wherefore was not I obedient unto ye voice

I am come almoost in to all mysfortune: in the myddest of the multitude and

Drink of the water of thine own well: (...)
and of the ryuers that run out of thine own sprynges.

Let thy wells flow out abroad, that there may be ryuers of waters in the
streets: but let them be only thine own, and not strangers with the.

Let thy well be blessed, and be glad with ye the wife of thy youth.

For every man's ways are open in the sight of the Lord, and he pondreth all

The wyckednesses of ye ungodly shall catch him self, and with the snares of
his own sins shall he be trapped.

Because he would not be reformed he shall dye: and for his great folyshnesse
he shall be destroyed.

CAPI. VI.
MY son, if thou be surety for thy neighbor, (...)
thou have fastened thine hand with an other man: yea thou art bound with
their own words: and taken with thine own speech.

Therefore, my son, do this: discharge thy self, for thou art come in to
thy neighbors danger.

Goo thy way then soon, and entreat thy neighbor: let not thine eyes sleep,
ne thine eye lyddes slomber.

Save thy self as a Do from the hand^, and as a bird from the hand of the
fouler.

Go to the Pysmere (thou sluggarde) consydre her ways, and learn to be wise.

She has no guide, no teacher, no leader: yet in the Summer she prouydeth her

When will thou arise out of thy sleep?

Yea sleep on still a little slombre a little, fold thine hands together yet a

So shall pouerte come unto the, as one that trauayleth by the way, and
necessity like a weaponed man.

A dissembling person, a wicked man goes with a froward mouth, he winketh
with his eyes, he tokeneth with his fete, he poynteth with his fyngers, he is
ever ymagenynge mischief and frowardness in his heart, and causes discord.

Therefore shall his destruction come hastily upon him: suddenly shall he be all
to broken, and not be healed.

There be six things which the Lord hates:
and the seventh he utterly abhors.

A proud look, a dissembling tongue, hands that shede innocent blood, an
heart that goes about with wicked ymagynacions, fete that be swyfte in
rennynge to do myschiefe, a false witness that brings vyl^es, and such one
as sows discord among brethren.



Put them up together in thine heart: and bind them about thy neck.

That they may lead the where thou go, preserve the when thou art a sleep,
and that when thou awakest, thou may talk of them.

For the commandment is a lantern, and the law a light: (...) xxviii.
yea chastenynge and nourtour is the way of life, that they may keep the from
the evil woman, and from the flattering tongue of the harlot: that thou lust not
after her beautye in thine heart, and lest thou be taken with her fair lokes.


An harlot will make a man to beg his breed: but a married woman will hunte for
the precious life.

May a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be brent?

Or can one go upon hot coals, and his fete

Even so, who so ever goes in to his neighbors wife, and touches her, can
not be vngyltye.

Men do not utterly despise a thief that steals to satisfye his soul, when
he is hongrye: but if he may be gotten, he restores again seven times as
much, or else he makes recompense with all the good of his house.

But who so commits aduoutrye with a woman, he is a fool, and brings his
life to deru^st^tion.

He gets him self also shame and dishonor, such as never shall be put one.

For the gelousye and wrath of the man will not be entreated: no though thou
would offer him great gifts to make amends, he will not receive them.

CAPI. VII.
MY son, keep my words, and lay up

Keep my commandments, and my law even as the apple of thine eye: and thou
shall live.

Bind them upon thy fyngers: and write them in the table of thine heart.

Say unto wisdom, thou art my sister, and call understanding thy kynswoman:
Pro.ii. b.v. ^.
that she may keep the from the strange woman, and from the harlot which
gives sweet words.

For out of the wyndowe of my house I looked

And behold, Gene.xix.v The harlot.
there met him a woman in an harlots apparel (a disceytful woman, wanton and an
unsteadfast woman, whose fete could not abide in the house: now is she without,
now in the streets, and lurketh in every corner) she caught the young man,
kyssed him, and was not ashamed, saying: I had a vow to pay, and this day I
perform it.

Therefore came I forth to mete the, that I might seek thy face: and so I have
found the.

I have deckte my bed with couerynges and clothes of Egypt.

My bed have I made to smell of Myrre, Aloes, and Cynamon.

Come let us lie together, and take our pleasure till it be day light.

For the goodma^ is not at home: he is gone far of.

He has taken the bag of money with him: who can tell when he comes home?

Thus with many sweet words she overcame him: and with her flatteryng lyppes
she

Immediately be followed her, as it were an ox led to the slaughter (and like
as it were to the stocks where fools are punysshed) so long till she had
wounded his liver with her darte: like as if a bird nested to the snare, not
knowing that the peril of his life lies thereupon.

Hear me now therefore, o my son, and mark the words of my mouth.

Let not thine heart wan^^ in her ways and be not thou discryu^^ in ^er paths.

For many one has she wounded and cast down: yea many a strong man has
she slain.

Her houses is the way unto hell, where men go down in to the chambres of
death.

Does not wisdom cry? does not understanding

Stands she not in the hye places in the streets and ways? does she not
cry before the whole city, and in the gates where men go out and in?

It is you, o ye men (says she) whom I call.

Unto you (o ye children of men) lift I up my voice.



Give ear, for I will speak of great matters, and open my lyppes to tell
things that be right.

For my throat shall be talking of the truth, and my lyppes abhor
ungodliness.

All the words of my mouth are ryghtous: there is no frowardness nor
falsehed therein.

They are all plain to such as will understand: and right to them that find
knowledge.

Receive my doctrine therefore, and not silver: and my knowledge, more then fine
gold.

For wisdom is more worth then precious stones: yea all the things that thou
can desire, are not to be compared unto it.



With me is the fear of the Lord, and the eschewynge of evil.

As for pride, disdain, and evil way, and a mouth that speaks wicked
things, I utterly abhor them.

I can give counsel and be a guide: I have understanding, I have strength.

Through me, kings reygne: through me, princes make just laws.

Through me, lords hear rule: and al judges of the earth execute judgment.

I am loving unto those that love me: and they that seek me early, shall find
me.

Richesse and honor are with me: yea excellent goods and ryghtousnesse.

My fruit is better then gold and precious stone: and mine increase more worth
then fine silver.

I walk in the way of ryghtousnesse: and in the street of judgment.

That I may find prosperity to those that love me: and to increase their
treasure.

The Lord him self had me in possession in the be^ynning of his ways, or ever
he began his works before time.

I have been ordained from everlasting: and from the beginning or ever the
earth was made.

When I was borne, there were neither depthes nor sprynges of water.

Before the foundacyons of the mountains were laid, yea before all hills was
I borne.

The earth, and all that is upon the earth was not yet made: no not the
ground it self.

For when he made the heuens, I was present, when he set up the depthes in
order: when he hanged the clouds above, when he fastened the sprynges of the
deep.

When he shut the sea within certain bounds, that the waters should not go
over their marks.

When he laid the foundacyons of the earth, I was with him, ordrynge all
things: delytynge daily, and reioysynge always before him.

As for the round compass of his world. I make it joyful: for my delight is
to be among the children of men.

Therefore harken unto me, o ye children, for blessed are they that keep my
ways.

O give ear unto nourtour, be wise, and refuse it not.

Blessed is the man yt hears me, watching daily at my gates: and gyuing
attendaunce at the posts of my doors.

For who so fyndeth me, fyndeth life: and shall obteyn favor of the Lord.

But who so offends against me hurts his own soul.

All they that hate me, are the lovers of death.

Because of sin the land does often change her pry^ce: but through men of
understanding and wisdom a realm endures long.

One poor man oppressynge an other b^ violence, is like a continual rain
that destroys the fruit.

They that forsake the law, praise the ungodly, but soche as keep the law,
abhor them.

Wicked men discern not the thing that is right, but they that seek after the
Lord, discuss all things

A poor man ledynge a godly life, is better then the rich that goethe in
froward ways.

Who so keeps the law, is a child of understanding:

Who so increases his riches by vauntage and winning, let him gather them to
help the poor withal.

He that turns away his ear from hearing the law, his prayer shall be
abhorred.

Who so ledeth the ryghtuous into an euel way, shall fall in to his own
pytte, but the just shall have the good in possession.

The rich man thinks him self to be wise, but the poor that has
understanding, can perceive him well enough.

When ryghtuous men are in prosperity, then does honor floryshe: but when
the ungodly come up, the state of men changes.

He that hydeth his sins, shall not prospere: but who so knowledgeth them and
forsakes them, shall have mercy.

Well is him that stands always in awe:

Like as a rorynge lion and an hongry bear, even so is an ungodly prince over
the poor people.

Where the prince is without understanding, there is great oppression and
wrong: but if he be soch one as hates covetousness, he shall long raygne.

He that by violence sheddeth any man's blood, shall be a rennagate unto his
grave, and no man shall be hable to succoure him.

Who so leads a godly and an innocente life, shall be safe: but he tha^ goes
froward ways, shall ones have a fall.

(...)
He that tylleth his land, shall have ple^teousnesse of bread: but he that
follows ydelnesse, shall have pouerte enough.

A faithful man is greatly to be commended, but he that makes to much haste
for to be rich shall not be vngyltie.

To have respect of persons in judgments not good.

And why? he will do wrong, ye even for a piece of bread.



He that rebukes a man, shall find more favor at the last, then he that
flattereth him.

Who so robs his father and mother, and says it is no sin: the same is
like unto a mortherer.

He that is of a proud stomach, stereth up strife, but he that puts his
trust in the Lord, shall be well fed.

He that trusts in his own heart, is a fool: but he that deals wisely,
shall be safe.

He that gives unto the poor,
shall not want: but he that turns away his eyes from soch as be in
necessite, shall suffer great pouerte him self.

When the ungodly are come up, men are feign to hyde them selfs: but when they
peryshe, the ryghtuous increase.

CAPI. XXIX.
HE that is styfnecked and will not be reformed,

Where the ryghtuous have the ouerhand, the people are in prosperity: but
where the ungodly bears rule, there the people mourn.

Who so loves wisdom, makes his father a glad man, Prou.v. ^ Luke.xv.c
but he that keeps harlottes, spends away that he has.

With true judgment the king sets up the land, but if he be a man that
takes gifts, he turns it vpsyde down.

Who so flatreth his neighbor, lays a net for his fete.

The sin of the wicked is his own snare, but the ryghtuous shall be glad and
rejoice.

The ryghtuous consydreth the cause of the poor, but the ungodly regards no
understanding.

Wicked people bring a city in decay, but wise men set it up again.

If a wise man go to law with a fool (whether he deal with him friendly or
roughly) he gets no rest.

The blood thyrstie hate the ryghtuous, but the just seek his soul.

A fool pours out his spyryte all together, but a wise man keeps it in
till afterward.

If a prince delight in lies, all his servants are ungodly.

The poor and the lender mete together, the Lord lyghteneth both their eyes.

The seat of the king that faithfully judges

The rod and correction mynistre wisdom, but if a child be not looked unto,
he brings his mother to shame.

When the ungodly come up, wickedness increases, but the ryghtuous shall se
their fall.

Nurtoure thy son with correction, and he shall comfort the, yea he shall do
the good at thine heart.

Where no Prophet is, there the people peryshe: but well is him that keeps
the law.

A servant will not be the better for words, for though he understand, yet
will he not regard them.

If thou seyst a man that is hastye to speak unadvised, thou may trust a
fool more then him.



Ioh.xxii. d
An angry man stereth up strife, and he that bears evil will in his mind,
does much evil.

After pride comes a fall, but a lowly spirit brings great worship.

Who so keeps comp^ny with a thief, hates his own s^ule: he hears
blasphemies and tells it not forth.

He that fears men, shall have a f^ll: but who so puts his trust in the
Lord shall come to honor

Many there be that seek the Princes favor, but every man's judgment comes
from the Lord.

The righteous abhors the ungodly: but as for those that be in the right
way, ye wicked hate them.

CAPI. XXX. The words of Agur the son of Iakeh.


For though I am the feast of all, and have no man's understanding (for I
never learned wisdom) yet have I understanding, and am well infourmed in godly
things.

Who has clymmed up in to heaven?

Who has come down from thence?

Who has holden the wind fast in his hand?

Who has comprehended the waters in a garment?

Who has set all the ends of the world?

What is his name, or his sons name? Can thou tell?

Psalm.xix.c Deuteronomy.iiii. a. and xii d. Psalm.xviii.c
All the words of God are pure and clean, for he is a shyld unto all them,
that put their trust in him.

Put thou nothing therefore unto his words, lest he reprove the, and thou be
found a liar.

Two things I require of the, that thou will not deny me before I dye.

Remove fro me vante and lies: give me nether pouerte nor riches, only grant
me a necessary living.



And lest I being constrained through pouerte, fall unto stealing, and
forswear the name of my God.

Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he speak evil of the also,
and thou be hurt.

He that brings up an evil report upon the generation of his father and
mother, is not worthy to be commended.

The generation that think themselves clean, shall not be cleansed from their
fylthynesse.

There are people that have a proud look, and cast up their eye lyddes.

This peoples tethe are sweardes, and with their chaftbones they consume and
devour the simple of the earth, and the poor from among men.

This generation (which is like an horsleche) has two daughters: the one is
called, fetch hither, and the other, bring hither.

There be three things that are never satisfied,

The hell, a woman's womb, and the earth has never water enough.

As for fire, it says never, hoo.

Who so laugheth his father to scorn, and sets his mothers commandment
at naught: the ravens pycke out his eyes in the valleye, and devoured be he of
the young A^gles.

There be three things to hye for me, and as for the fourth, it passes my
knowledge.

The way of an Aegle in the air, the way of a serpent over a stone, the way
of a ship in the sea, and the way of a man with a young woman.

Soch is the way also of a wife that breaks wedlock, which wipeth her mouth
like as when she has eaten, and says: I have done no harm.

Through three things the earth is disquieted, and the fourth may it not bear.

Through a servant that bears rule, through a fool that has great riches,
through an idle houswyfe, and through an handemayden that is heir to her
maistres.

There be four things in the earth, the which are very little: but in
wisdom they exceade the wise.

The Pysmyres are but a weak people, yet gather they their meat to gether in
the harueste.

The Conyes ar but a feeble folk, yet make they their touches among the rocks.

The greshoppers have not a gide, yet go they forth together by heaps.

The spyder labors with her hands, and that in the Kings palace.

There be three things that go styfly, but the going of the fourth is the
godlyest of all.

A Lion, which is King of beasts, and geuethe place to no man: A Cock
ready to fight: A ram and a King that goes forth with his people.

If thou be so folysh to magnify thy self, or medlest with any soche thing,
then lay thine hand upon thy mouth.

Who so chyrneth mylcke, makes butter: he that rubbeth his nose, makes it
blede: and he that causes wrath, brings forth strife.

MY son, thou son of my body:

O Lamuel, give kings no wine, give kings and princes no strong d^inke:

pore, and of all such as be in adversity.

Give strong drink unto such as are condemned to death, and wine unto those
ye mourn that they may drink it, and forget their mysery and adversity.

Be thou an advocate, and stand in judgment the self, to speak for all
such as be domme and succouries.

With thy mouth defend the thing that is lawful and right, and the cause of
the poor and helpless.

ALEPH. Who so fyndeth an honest faithful woman,

BETH. The heart of her housbande may safely trust in her, so that he shall
have no need of spoils.

GIMEL. She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.

DALETH. She occupyeth woll and fl^xe, and labors gladly with her hands.

HE. She is like a merchants ship, that brings her vitayles from a far.

VAV. She is up in the night season, to provide meat for her household, and
fode for her maidens.

ZAIN. She consydereth land, and byeth it, and with the fruit of her hands
she planteth a vyneyarde.

HETH. She gyrdeth her loins with strength, and courageth her arms.

TETH.

IOD. She lays her fingers to the spyndle, and her hand takes hold of the
rock.

CAPH. She opens her hand to the pore, yea she stretches forth her hands
to such as have need.

LAMED. She fears not that the cold of wyntre shall hurt her house, for all
her household folks are double clothed.

MEM. She makes her self fair ornaments, her clothing is white sylcke and
purple.

NVN. Her housbande is much set by in the gates, when he sytteth among the
rulers of the land.

SAMECH. She makes clothe of silk and sells it, and delyuereth a gyrdle
unto the merchant.

AIN.

PHE. She opens her mouth with wisdom, and in her mouth is the law of grace.

ZADE She looks well to the ways of her household, and eats not her bred
with ydelnes.

KOPH. Her children arise, and call her blessed: and her husband makes moc^e
of her.

RES. Many daughters there be that gather richesse together, but thou go
above them all.

SIN. As for favor, it is disceytfull, and beautye is a vain thing: but a
woman that fears the Lord, she is worthy to be praised.

THAV. Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her
in the gates.

All that is in this world is vanity,

CAPI. I.
(...)
The eye is not satisfied with sight, the ear is not filled with hearing. The
thing that has been, comes to pass again: and the thing that has been
done, is done again, there is no new thing under ye Sun. Is there any
thing whereof it may be said: lo, this is new? For it was long ago in the
times that have been before us. The thing that is past, is out of remembrance

Thus I have consydred all the things that come to pass under the Sun, and
lo, they are all but vanity and vexacion of mind.

Abundance of riches, of pleasure, and of buildynge, are vain things.

CAPI. II.
THen said I thus in my heart: Now go

So I thought in my heart, to withdraw my flesh from wyue, so apply my mind
unto wisdom, and to comprehend folyshnes until the time ye (among all the
things which are under ye sun) I might se what were best for men to do, so
long as they live under heaven. I made gorgious fair works. I builded me
houses, and planted vyneyardes. I made

I provided me singers and women which could play of instruments, to make
men mirth and pastyme. I gat me drinkinge cups also and glasses. (Shortly) I
was greater and in more worship, then all my predecessors in Jerusalem. For
wisdom remained with me and look what so ever mine eyes desired, I let them
have it: and wherein so ever my heart delyted or had any pleasure, I withhelde it
not from it. Thus my heart reioysed in all yt I did, and this I took for the
portion of all my travail. But when I consydred all the works that my hands
had wrought, and all the labors that I had taken therein: lo, all was but
vanity and vexacion of mind, and nothing of any value under the Sun. The^
turned I me to consydre wisdom, error and folyshnesse (for what is he among
men, that might be compared to me the king in such works?) and I saw that
wisdom excels folyshnesse, as far as light does darckenes For a wise man
bears his eyes about in his

So I turned me to refrain my mind from all such travail, as I took under
the sun

For what gets a man of all the labor and travail of his mind, that he
takes under the Sun, but heaviness, sorrow and disquyetnes all the days of his
life? In so much that his heart can not rest in the night. Is not this also a
vain thing? Is it not better the^ for a man to eat and drink, and his soul
to be merry in his labor? Yea I saw that this also was a gift of God: For who
may eat drink, or bring any thing to pass without him? And why? he gives
unto man, what it pleases him: whether it be wisdom, understanding, or
gladness. But unto the sinner he gives wearynes and sorrow, that he may
gather and heap together the thing, ye afterward shall be given unto him whom
it pleases God. This is now a vain thing, yea a very disquietnesse and
vexacion of mind.

All things come in their time and pass away in their time.

CAP. III.
EVery thing has a time, yea all that is

There is a time to be borne, and a time to dye.

There is a time to plant, and a time to pluck up the thing, that is planted

A time to stay, and a time to make hole.

A time to break down, and a time to build up.

A time to weep, and a time to laughe

A time to mourn, and a time to daunse.

A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together.

A time to enbrace, and a time to refrain from enbracynge.

A time to win, and a time to lose.



A time to cut in pieces, and a time to sow together

A time to keep silence, and a time to speak.

A time to love, and a time to hate.

A time of war, and a time of peax.

What has a man else (that does any thing) but werynesse and labor? For as
touching the travail and carfulness which God has given unto men, I se ye
he has given it them to be exercysed in it. All this has he ordened marvelous
goodly, to every thing his due time. He has planted ignorance also in the
hertes of men, that they should not find out the ground of his works, which
he does from the beginning to the end. So I perceived,
that men should fear him. The thing that has been, is now and the thing
that is for to come, has been before time, for God restores again ye thing
that was past. Moreover,
I saw under the Sun ungodliness in the flede of judgment and iniquite in
stead of rightousnesse. Then thought I in my mind: God shall separate ye
righteous from the ungodly, and then shall be the time and judgment of all
councels and works. I commened with mine own heart also concerning the
children of men: how God has chosen them, and yet lets them apeare: as
though they were beasts: for it

The myseryes of the innocent. The superfluous labors of men. The child yt is

brother: yet i^ there no end of his careful travail, his eyes can not be

whom do I take such travail? ^or whose pleasure do I thus consume away my

not an other to help him up. Again, when two sleep together they are warm: but
how can a body be warm alone? One may be overcome, but two may make
resistance: a three fold table is not lightly broken. A poor child being wise,
is better then an old king that doteth, and can not beware in time to come.
Some one comes out

As for the people that have been before him, (...)

All these things have I considered, and applied my mind unto every work
that is under the sun: how one man has lordshyp upon an other to his own
harm. For I have often seen the ungodly brought to their graves, and fallen
down from the hye and glorious place: in so much yt they were forgotten in the
city, where they were ha^ in so hye and great reputacion. This is also a vain
thing. Because now that evil works are not hastily punisshed, the heart of man
gives him self over unto wickedness. But though an evil person offend an

Yet is there a vanity upon earth: There be just men, unto whom it
happens, as though they had the works of the ungodly: Again, there be
ungodly, with whom it goes as though they had the works of the ryghteous.
This me thyncke also a vain thing. Therefore I commend gladness, because a
man has no better thing under the sun, then to eat and drink, and to be
merry: for that shall he have of his labor all the days of his life, which
God gives him under the sun. When I applied my mind to learn wisdom, and
to know the travail a facion, that I suffered not mine eyes to sleep neither
day ne night) I understood of all the works of God, that it is not possible
for a man to attain unto the works that are done under the sun: and though
he bestow his labor to seek them out, yet can he not reach unto the^: yea
though a wise man would undertake to know them, yet might he not find them.

A man woteth not, by the ryghtousenesse of his own works, whether he be

subtyle: to be had in favor, it helps not to be cunning: but that all lies

Your land lies waste, your cities are (...)
and ye must be feign to stand, and look upon it: and it is desolate, as it
were with enemies in a batell. Moreover the daughter of Sion is left alone
like a courage in a vyneyarde, like a watchehouse in time of war, like a
besieged city. And except the Lord of hou^es had left us a few alive: (...)
we should have been as Sodoma,
and like unto Gomorra.

Hear the word of the Lord ye tyrauntes of Sodoma, and harken unto the law
of our God, thou people of Gomorra. Why offer ye so many sacryfices unto me? I

And unless ye be ashamed of the odetrees wherein ye have so delyted, and of

Moreover this is the word that was Mich.iiii. ^

the multitude of ye people shall go unto him, speaking thus one to an other:
arise, let us goo to the hill of the Lord, and to the house of the God of
Jacob: that he may show us his way, and that we may walk in his paths. For
the law shall come out of Syon, and the word of God from Jerusalem, and shall
give sentence among the Heathen, and shall refourme the multitude of people:
So that they shall break their swerdes and speres, to make sythes, sicles and
sawes thereof. From that time forth shall not one people lift up weapen against
an other, neither shall they learn to fight from thence forth. It is to the

your fyngers have made. There kneleth the man, there falls the man down

of their countenance bewrays them, yea they declare their own sins them
selves, as the Sodomites, and hyde them not. Woe be unto their souls, for they

and mar the faces of the innocents? thus shall the God of hosts reuyle them.

Moreover thus says the Lord: Seeing the daughters of Syon are become so
proud, and come in with stretched out necks, and with vain wanton eyes:
seeing they come in cryppynge so nycely with their feet: Therefore shall the
Lord shave the hee^es of the daughters of Sion, and make their braurye bare in

and pynnes, glasses and smockes, vonettes and taches.

And instead of good smell there shall be styncke among them. And for their
gyrdles there shall be loose bands. And for well set here, there shall be
baldness. Instead of a stomacher, a sake cloth, and for their beauty

My beloved friend has a vyneyarde in a very fruitful plenteous ground.
This he hedged, this he walled round about, and and planted it with goodly
grapes. In the myddest of it builded he a tower, (...)
and made a wine press therein. And afterward when he looked that it should
bring him grapes, it brought forth thorns. I shew^ you now my came (o ye
cytezyna of Jerusalem and hole Judah:) Judge I pray you between me and my
vyneyarde. What more could have been done for it, that I have not done?
Wherefore then have it given thorns, where I looked to

Well I shall tell you how I will do with my vyneyarde: I will take the hedge
from it, that it may perysshe, and break down the wall, that it may be
trodden under foot. I will lay it waste, that it shall neither be twylled nor
cut, but bear thorns and breates. I will also forbid the clouds, that they
shall not rain upon it. As for the vineyarde of the Lord of hosts, it is the
house of Israel, and hole Judah his fair plantynge. Of these he looked for
equity, but se there is wrong: for ryghtousnesse, loo, it is but miserye.

Woo be unto you that join one house to an other,
and bring one land so nygh unto an other, till ye can gerte no more ground.
Will ye dwell upon the earth alone? The Lord of hosts roundeth me thus in the
ear:

Woe be unto them that rise up earlye to use them selves in dronckennesse, and
yet at night are more superstuous with wine. In those companyes are harpes and
lutes, tabrettes and pypes, and wine. But they regard not the work of the
Lord, and consydre not the work of his hands. Therefore comes my folk also
in captivity, because

Thus shall man have a fall, he shall be brought low, and the high locks of
the proud laid down. But the Lord of hosts, that holy God, shall be exalted,
and untouched, when he shall declare his equity and ryghtousnesse after this
manner: Then shall the lambs eat their appointed fodder, and shall feed
plenteoustye in the mountains. Woo be unto vain person that draw wickedness
unto them, as it were with a cord, and sin, as it were with a cart rope,
which use to speak on this manner: let him make haste now, and go forth with
his work, that we may se it. Let the counsel of the holy one of Israel come
and draw nigh, that we may know it.

Woe be unto them that call evil good, and Prove.iii. a Roma.xii. ^
Woo be unto them that are wise in their own sight, and think them selves to
have understanding. Woe be unto them that are cunning men to suppe out wine,
and expert to set up drunkenness. These give sentence with the ungodly for
rewards, but condemn the lust ca^^e of the ryghtous.

Therefore like as fire licketh up the str^w, and as the flame consumes the
s^^bble: even so (when their root is full) their blossom shall vanysshe away
like dus^ or smoke: for they despise the law of the Lord of hosts, and
blaspheme the word of the holy maker of Israel.

unclean lips also) should se the king and Lord of hosts with mine eyes.

Then slew one of the Seraphins unto me having a hot cole in his hand,

Then said God unto Esaias: go mete Achaz (thou and thy son Sear Iasub) at the

him, take heed to thy self, and be still, but fear not, neither be faint

wrath and furiousness of Razin the Sirian, and Romelles

Moreover, God spoke unto Achaz, saying: require a token of the Lord thy God,
whether it be toward the depth benethe, or toward the heygth above. Then
said Achez: I will require none, neither will I tempte the Lord. The Lord
answered: Then hear to ye of the house of David: Is it not enough for you that
ye be grievous unto men, but ye must grieve my God also? And therefore the Lord
shall give you a token of him self: M^^^ L^^^ Ch^^ (...)
Emanuel. Butter and honye shall be eat, that he may know the evil, and
chose the good. But or ever that child come to knowledge, to eschew the evil
and chose the good. The land (that thou art so afraid for) shall be desolace of
both her kings.

The Lord also shall send a time upon the, upon thy people, and upon thy
fathers house (soch as never came sense the time that Ephraim departed from
Judah,) through the king of the Assirians. For at the same time shall the Lord
whistle for the flies that are about the water of Egypt, and for the Bees in
the Assirians land. These shall come, and shall light all in the valleys, in

where, that asks not counsel at his God, whether it be concerning the dead,

testimony, whether they speak not after this meaning: If he do not this, he
stombleth and suffers hunger. And if he suffer hunger, he is out of patience,
and blasphemeth his king and his God. Then looks he upward, and downewarde
to the earth, and behold there is trouble and darken esse, vexacion is round

After all this, the wrath of the Lord shall not cease, but yet his hand

shall rote out of Israel both head and tail, branch and twigge in one

And the king of the Assirians sent Rabsakeh from Lac^is toward Jerusalem
against king Ez^chi^s, with a grievous host, which set him by the condyte of
the ouerpole, in the way that goes through the fullers land. And so there
came forth unto him Eliakim Helkiahs son, the President, Sobna the Scribe, and
Ioah Asaphs son ye Secretary.

And Rabsakeh said unto them: Tell Ezechias that the great king of Assiria
says thus unto him: What presumpcion is this that thou trustest unto? Thou
thynkest peradventure, thou haste counsel and power enough to maynteyn this
war: or else where to trustest thou, that thou castest thy self of fro me? lo,
thou put thy trust in a broken staff of ^eed (I mean Egypt) which he
that leans upon, it goes in to his hand, and shoteth him through.



Then said Eliakim, Sobna and Ioah unto Rabsakeh: Speak to us thy servants
(we pray the) in the Sirians language, for we understand it well: And speak
not ^o us in the Jews tongue, leest the folk hear, which lies upon the
wall. Then answered Rabsakeh: Thyncke ye that the king sent me to speak this
only unto you? Has he not sent me to them also that lie upon the wall: that
they be not compelled to eat their own donge, and drink their own stale
with you?

And Rabsakeh stood styffe, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews tongue,
and said.

and put on a sackcloth, and went in to the temple of the Lord. But he sent
Eliakim the President, Sobna ye Scribe with the eldest priests clothed in sack
unto ye Prophet Esaye the son of Amoz, and they said unto him: Thus says
Ezechias: This is the day of trouble, of plage, and of wrath: like as when a
child comes to the birth, but the woman has no power to bring it forth.
The Lord thy God, no doubt, has well considered the words of Rabsakeh,
whom his lord the king of Assirians has sent, to defye and blaspheme the
living God: with such words as the Lord thy God has herd right well. And
therefore lift up thy prayer for the remnaunte that yet are left. So the
servants of king Ezechias came to Esaye.



And when the king of Assiria herd that,

Now when Ezechias had received the lettre of the messengers, and red it, he
went up in to the house of the Lord, and opened the lettre before the Lord.
And Ezechias prayed before the Lord, on this manner: O Lord of hosts, thou
God of Israel, which dwell upon Cherubyn. Thou art the God that only is God
of all the kingdoms of the world, for thou only have created heaven and earth.
Enclyne thyn ear, Lord, and considre, open thine eyes, o Lord, and se and

It is true, O Lord, that the kyng^s of Assiria have conquered all kingdoms ^
lands, and cast their gods in the fire. Notwithstanding those were no
gods, but the works of men's hands, of kind or stone, therefore have they
destroyed them. Deliver us then, O Lord our God, from the hands of
Sennacherib, that al kingdoms of the earth may know that thou only art the
Lord. Then Esaye the son of Amoz, sent unto Ezechias, saying: Thus says the
Lord God of Israel: where as thou have made thy prayer unto me, as touching
Sennacherib this is the answer, that the Lord has given concerning him:

Despised art thou and mocked, o daughter of Syon, he has shaken his heed at

blasphemed? add against whom thou have lyfted up thy voice, and exalted thy

Thus the angel went forth, and slew of the Assirians host, an hundred four

all lay full of deed bodies. So Sennacherib the king of ye Assirians brake up

Nesrah his God, and Adramalech and Sarazer his own sons, slew him with the

the Lord, and said: Remember, O Lord, that I have walked before the in
truth, and steadfast heart, and have done the thing that is pleasant to

Then said God unto Esaye: God and speak unto Ezechias: the Lord God of

Then chatred I like a swalowe: and like a crane, and mourned as a dove.

I lift up mine eyes in to the heygth: O Lord (said I) violence is done unto

Verily (Lord) men should live in bitterness: and all my life must I pass
over therein, for thou raisest me up, and wakest me.

But loo, I will be well content with this bytternesse.

I will declare the goodness of the Lord, yea and the praise of the Lord for
all that he has given us, for the great good that he has done for Israel:
which he has given them of his own favor, and according to the multitude of

Behold, my servants shall rejoice for very quietness of heart: But ye

call his servants by an other name. Who so reioyseth upon earth, shall
rejoice in the true God. And who so swears upon earth, shall swear in the
true God. For the old emnyte shall be forgotten, and taken away out of my
sight. For lo, I shall make a new heaven, and a new earth. And as for the
old, they shall never be thought upon, ne kept in mind: but men shall be
glad and evermore rejoice, for the things that I shall do.

For why: Behold, I shall make a joyful Ierusal^m, Apoca.xxi. a.
yea I my self will rejoice with

But earth shall be ye serpents meat. There shall no man hurt ne slaye an

God dwells not in temples, made by man's hand. He despyseth sacrifyces
done without mercy and faith. God comfort them that are troubled for his

Where shall now the house stand yt ye will build unto me? And where shall
be the place* yt will I dwell in? As for these things, my hand has made them
all, and they are all created, says the Lord. Which of them shall I then
regard? Even him that is of a lowly troubled spirit, and stands in awe of
my words. For who so slays an ox for me, does me so great dishonor, as
he yt kylleth a man. He that kills a sheep for me choketh a dog. He that
brings me meat offeringes, offers swynes blood: Who so

and the thing that they fear, will I bring upon them. For when I called, no
man gave answer: when I spoke they would not hear: But did wickedness before
mine eyes, and chose the things that dysplease me. Hear the word of God all
ye that fear the thing which he speaks. Your brethren that hate you, and
cast you out for my names sake, say Let the Lord magnyfy him self, that we
may se your gladness: and yet they shall be confounded.

For as touching the city and the temple Then shall ye suck, ye shall be
borne upon her sides, and be joyful upon her knees. For like as a child is
comforted of his mother, so shall I comfort you, and ye shall be comforted in
Jerusalem. And when ye se this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall
florysh like an herb.





And I shall take out certain of them for to be Prestes and Leuytes, says
the Lord. Apoca.xxi. ^
For like as the new heaven and the new earth which I will make, shall be fast
stablysshed by me, (says the Lord.) So shall your sede and your name
continue, and there shall be a new Moon for the other, and a new Sabbath for
the other, and all flesh shall come to worship before me, (says the Lord.)
And they shall goo forth and look upon the earyons of them that have
transgressed against me. Mar. ^x. ^
For their worms shall not dye, neither shall their fire be quenched, and all
flesh shall abhor them.

The end of the book of the Prophet Esaye.
THE BOOK OF THE PROPHET IEREMYE.
The f^ocke of Jeremy, and in what time he prophesied. He excuses him self
and would refuse the office of a Prophet, because he is young and vnexperte.
He is taught of the Lord, and becomes bold. God opens unto him, that the
destruction of the Jews, by the Babilonians, is at hand. Jeremy is commanded
to speak the word of God unto the Jews, without fear.

CAPI. I.


And with that, the Lord stretched out his hand, and touched my mouth, and
said moreover Iere.xviii. a
and this day do I set the over the people and kingdoms, that thou may rote
out, break of, destroy, and make waste, and that thou may build up and
plant. After this, the Lord spoke unto me, saying: Jeremy, what see thou?
And I said: I se a wakyng rod. Then said the Lord: thou haste seen right,
for I will watch diligently upon my word, to perform it.

It happened afterward, that the Lord spoke to me again, and said: What
see thou? And I said: I se a seething pot, lokyng from out of the North
hither ward.

Jeremy.iiii. a
Then said the Lord unto me: Out of the North shall come a plage upon all the
dwellers of the land. For lo, I will call all the officers of the kingdoms of
the North (says the Lord.) And they shall come, and every one shall set his
^eate in the gates of Jerusalem, and in all their walls round about and
through

And therefore gyrde up thy loins, arise, and tell them all, that I give the in
commandment. Fear them not, I will not have the to be afraid of them. For
behold, this day do I make the a strong fensed town, an iron pyller, and a
wall of stele against the hole land, against the kings and mighty men of Judah,
against the prestes and people of the land. They shall fight against the, but
they shall not be hable to overcome the, for I am with the, to deliver the,
says the Lord.

God reherseth his benefytes done unto the Jews. Against Prestes and
Prophets, or prechers that contemn and despise God. The Jews are destroyed,
because they forsook God, and because they ran a hoar hunting after Idolles.

CAPI. II.
Moreover, the word of the Lord commanded me thus: Go thy way, cry

What unfaithfulness found your fathers in me, that they went so far away
fro me,

The Prestes them selves said not ones: Where is the Lord? They that have the
law in their hands, know me not. The shepherdes offend against me. The
Prophets do service unto Baal, and follow such things as shall bring them
no profyt.

Wherefore I am constrained (says the Lord) to make my co^playnte upon you,
and

Be astonished, o ye heuens, be afraid and abashed at such a thing, says
the Lord. For my people has done two euyls. They have forsaken me the well
of water of life, and dug them pittes, yea vile and broken pittes that hold
no water. Is Israel a bond servant, or one of the household? Why is he then
so spoiled? Why do they rore and cry then upon him as a lion? They have made
his land waste, his cities are so brent up, that there is no man dwelling in
them. Yea the children of Noph and Taphnes have defiled thy neck.

Comes not this unto the, because thou

I have ever broken thy yoke of old, and burste thy bonds: yet sayste thou, I
will no more serve, (...). b
but (like an harlot) thou runnest about upon all hye hills, and among all
grene trees, (...).xxi. d
where as I planted the out of noble grapes, and good rotes. How art thou
turned then in to a bitter, unfruitful, and and strange grape? Yea, and that
so soore:

Say not now: I am not unclean, and I have not followed the Gods. Look upon
thine own ways in the woddes, valeys, and dens: so shall thou know what
thou have done. Thou art like a swyfte Dromadary that goes easily his way:
and thy wantonness is like a wild ass that uses the wilderness, and that
snoffeth and blows at his will. Who can tame the? All they that seek the,
shall not fail, but find yt in thine own uncleanness. Thou kepest thy foot from
nakedness, and thy throat from thyrst, and think thou in thy self: tush, I
will take no sorrow, I will love the strange gods, and hang upon them.

Like as a thief that is taken with the deed comes to shame, even so is the
house of Israel come to confusion: the commen people, their kings and rulers,
(...).c (...) ^^xxii. d (...)
their prestes and prophets. For they say to a stock: thou art my father,
and to a stone: thou have begotten me:

But in the time of their trouble, when they say: stand up and help us, I
shall answer them: Where are now thy gods, that thou have made the? bid them
stand up and help the in the time of need. For look how many cities thou have
(O Judah) so many gods have thou also.

Wherefore then will ye goo to law with me, Jeremy.xi. e
saying ye all are sinners against me says the Lord? It is but lost
labor, that I smite your children, for they receive not my correction. Your
own sword destroys your Prophets, like a devouring lion. If ye be the
people of the Lord, then harken unto his word: Am I then become a wilderness
unto the people of Israel? or a land that has no light? Wherefore says my
people then: we are fallen of, and we will come no more unto the? Does a
maiden forget her raymente, or a bryde her stomacher? And does my people
forget me so long? Why boostest thou thy ways so hyghly (to obtain favor
there through) when thou have yet stained them with blasphemies?

Upon thy wings is found the blood of poor and innocent people,
Deute.xviii. b Jeremy.vii. a Ezech.xx. d
and that not in corners and holes only, but openly in all places. Yet dare
thou say I am gyltlesse: Tusshe, his wrath can not come upon me. Behold, I
will reason with the, because thou dare say: I have not offended. O how
evil will it be for the to abide it: when it shall be known how often thou
have gone backwarde?

For thou shalt be confounded as well of Egypt, as of the Assirians: Yea,
thou shalt goo thy way from them, and smite thine hands together upon thy
heed: Because the Lord shall bring that confydence and hope of thine to
naught, and thou shall not prospere withal.

God being merciful, calls unto repentance his people, which he had
forsaken for their hooredome with ydolles. He exhorts Israel unto
repentance, promising them shepeherdes that should have the true knowledge
of God. The return of Israel unto God, confessing their offense.

CAPI. III.
COmmenly when a man puts away

This is the cause, that the rain and evening dew has ceased Thou haste
gotten ever? Or will thou withdraw thy self clean fro me? Nevertheless
thou speak^st such words, but thou art ever doing worse and worse.

The Lord said also unto me: in the

For all this her unfaithful sister Judah was not ashamed, but went back and
played the hoore also. Yea, and the noise of her hooredome has defiled the
hole land. For she has committed her aduoutrye with stones and stocks.

Nevertheless her unfaithful sister Judah is not couened again unto me with
her hole heart, but faynedly* says the Lord. And the

Ezechiel.ii.c. O^ee.xiiii. a
O ye shrynkynge children, turn again, says the Lord: a^^o I will be married

Moreover, when ye be increased and multiplied in the land, then (says the
Lord) there shall no more boste be made of the Arcke of the Lords Testament:
No man shall think upon it, neither shall any man make mention of it: for
from thence forth it shall neither be visited, ne honored with gyfte^.

Then shall Jerusalem be called the Lords ^eare, and all Heathen shall be
gathered unto it, for the Lords names sake, which shall be set forth, they
shall follow no more the ymaginacion of their own froward heart.

Then those that be of the house of Judah, Math. (...)
call me father only, and not to shrynke fro me.

But like as a woman fails her lover, so are ye unfaithful unto me (O ye
house of Israel) says the Lord. And therefore the voice of the children of
Israel was herd on every side, wepinge and waylinge: for they have de^iled
their way, and forgotten God their Lord.

O ye shrynckynge children, turn again

Confusion has devoured our fathers labor from our youth up: yea, their
sheep and bullockes, their sons and daughters. So do we also sleep in our
confusyon, and shame covers us: for we and our fathers from our youth up
unto this day, have sinned against the Lord our God, and have not obeyed
the voice of the Lord our God.

The true repentance or returning to God. He exhorts to the circumcision of
the heart. The destruction of Iewrye is prophesied, for the malice of their
hertes.

CAPI. IIII.
O Israel, if thou will turn the, then

Be circumcised in the Lord, and cut away the foreskynne of your hertes,
Ose x. d
all ye of Judah, and all the indwellers of Jerusalem: that my indignacion break
not out like fire, and kyndle, so that no man may quench it, because of the
wickedness of your ymaginacions.

Preach in Judah and Jerusalem: Iere^* ^
cry out fearful wrath of the Lord shall not be withdrawn from you.





For a voice from Dan, and from the hill of Ephraim speaks out, and tells
of a destruction. Behold the Heathen give Jerusalem warnyng, and preach unto
her, that her destroyers are coming from far countries. They tell the
cities of Judah the same also, they shall give them warning in every place,
like as the watch men in the field. For they have provoked me to wrath, says
the Lord.

(...)
this is thine own wickedness and disobedience that has possessed thine
heart: Ah my belly, ah my belly, (shalt thou cry) how is my heart so sore? my
heart pants within me, I can not be still, for I have herd the cryinge of the
trompettes and peales of war.

They cry murder upon murder, the hole land shall perysshe. Immediately my
tents were destroyed, and my hangynges in the twincklynge of an eye. How long
shall I se the tokens of war, and hear the noise of the trompettes.

Nevertheless, this shall come upon them, (...). d.
They are the children of folyshnesse, and without any discrecion. To do evil,
they have wit enough: but to do well, they have no wisdom. I have looked upon
the earth: and se, it is waste and void. I looked toward heaven, and it had no
shine.

I beheld the mountains and they trembled, and all the hills were in a
fear. I looked about me, and there was no body, and all the birds of the
air were away. I marked well, and the plowed field was become waste: yea al
their cities were broken down at the presence of the Lord, and indignacion of
his wrath.



What wylt thou now do, thou being destroyed? Jeremy.ii.c.
For though thou clothest thy self with scarlet, and deckest the with gold:
though thou paintest thy self with colors, yet shall thou trym thy self in
vain.

For those that hitherto have been thy great favorers shall abhor the, and
goo about to slay the. For (me think) I hear a noise, like as it were a
woman traueylynge, or one labouryng of her first child: Even ye voice of the
daughter Sion, that casts out her arms, and sowneth, saying: Ah, woe is me,
how sore vexed and faint is my heart, for the^ that are slain?

In Iewrye is there no ryghtous or faithful man found, either amongst the
people, or the rulars, for whose sake the Lord should spare the city:
wherefore Iewrye is destroyed of the Assyrians.

CAPI. ^.
Look through Jerusalem: behold and

Thou have scourged them, but they took no repentance: thou have correct the^
for amendment, but they refused thy correction. They made their faces harder
then a stone, and would not amend.

Therefore I thought in my self: peradventure

Wherefore a lion out of the wod shall hurt them, and a wolf in the evening
shall destroy them. The cat of the mountain shall lie lurkynge by their
cities, to tear in pieces all them that come therout. For their offenses art
many, and their departing away is great. Should I then for all this have

In ye desire of uncleanly lust they are become like the stoned horse, every man
neyeth at his neyghbourss wife: should I not correct this says the Lord?

Should I not be avenged of every people, that is like unto this? Ezechi.xxij.c.
Clyme up upon their walls beat them down, but destroy them not utterly:
cut of their branches, because they are not the Lords. For unfaithfully has
the house of Israel and Judah forsaken me, says the Lord. They have denied
the Lord, and said: it is not he. Tusshe, there shall no mysfortune come upon
us: we shall se neither sword nor honger. As for the warnyng of the Prophets,
they take it but for wind: yea there is none of these, which will tell them,
that such things shall happen unto them.



Lo, I will bring a people upon you from far, O house of Israel (says the
Lord) a mighty people, an old people, a people whose speech thou know
not, neither understand what they say. Their arowes are sodeyne death: yea
they them selves be very gyauntes. This people shall eat up thy fruit and thy
meat: yea they shall devour thy sons and thy daughters, thy sheep and thy
bullockes.

They shall eat up thy grapes and fygges. As for thy strong and well sensed
cities wherein thou dyddest trust, they shall destroy them with the swearde.
Nevertheless I will not have done with you, says the Lord But if ^hey

though it rage, yet can it do nothing, and though the waves thereof do

But this people has a false and obstynate

Nevertheless your myldes have turned these from you, and your sins have
rubbed you hereof. For among my people are found wicked persons, that
pryuyly lay snares, and wait for men, to take them and destroy them. And
like as a net is full of birds, so are their houses full of that which they
have gotten with falsehed and disceyte.

Hereof comes their great substance

Should I not punish these things, Esaias (...) Zach. (...)
says ye Lord? should I be avenged of all such people as these be? Horrible

The Prophets teach falsely, and the priests follow them, and my people
has pleasure therein. What will come thereof at the last?

The sins for which Jerusalem is afflycte. Vncircumcysed ears.
Covetousness. Disceyte. The Lord reiecteteh the sacrifyces of the Jews. The
coming of the Babylonyans is prophesied again.

gatherer. But unto whom shall I speak, whom shall I warn, that he may take heed? Their ears are so vncircumcysed, that they may not hear.

Behold, they take ye word of God but for a scorn, and have no lust thereto.
And therefore I am so full of indignacio^, o Lord, that I may suffer no longer.
Shede out thy wrath upon the children that are without, and upon all young
men.

Yea the man must be taken prisoner with the wife, and the aged with the
creple. Their houses with their lands and wives shall be turned unto
strangers, when I stretche out mine hand upon the inhabitauntes of this

covetousness: and from the Prophet unto the Priest, they goo all about with
falseheed and lies.



Thus says the Lord: goo in to the streets, consydre and make inquisicion
for the old way, and if it be the good and right way: then goo therein, that
ye may find rest for your souls. But they say: we will not walk therein,

and I will set watch men

For they have not been obedient unto my words, and to my law, but abhorred

And therefore thus says the Lord: behold, I will make this people fall, and
there shall fall from among them the father with the children, one neighbor
shall perysshe with an other.



Then shall this cry be heard: Our arms are feeble, heaviness and sorrow is
come upon us, as upon a woman traueylynge with child. No man goo forth in to

enemy shall be on every side.

Wherefore gyrde a sack clothe about the Amos.viij. b.

shall suddenly fall upon us. The have I set for a prouer of my hard people, to
seek out, and to try their ways. For they are all unfaithful and fallen
away, they hang upon fylthy lucre, they are clean brass and iron, for they
hurt and destroy every man. The bellous are burnt in the fire, the lead is
consumed, the melter melts in vain, for the evil is not taken away from
them. Therefore shall they be called noughtye silver, because the Lord has
cast them out.

Ieremye is commanded to show unto the people the word of God, which
trusts in the outward service of the temple, that helps nothing. The

They pour out drynckeofferynges unto strange Gods, to provoke me unto

And therefore thus says the Lord God: behold, my wrath and my indignacion

But they were not obedient, they inclyned not their ears thereunto, but went

Behold, the disceytfull pen of the scribes, sets forth lies: therefore

As for their gods, it may well be said of them: they are gods that neither

such: but it is he that has made al things, and Israel is the rod of his
enheritaunce: The Lord of hosts is his name. Put away thine uncleanness out
of the land, thou that art in the strong cities. For thus says the Lord:
Behold, I will now thruste out the inhabitauntes of this land a great way

Alas how am I hurt? Alas how paynefull are my scourges unto me? For I considre

but with favor and not in thy wrath, bring us not utterly to naught. Pour
out thine indignacion rather upon the Heathen that know the not, and upon the
people that call not on thy name: And that because they have consumed, devoured
and destroyed Jacob, and have roted out his glory.

A curse of them that obey not the word of Gods promise. The people of

And therefore have I accused them as transgressors of all the words of this

And the Lord said unto me: It is found out, that hole Israel, and all these

house of Israel and Judah have broken my couenaunte, which I made with their

But pray not thou for this people: bid neither praise ne prayer for them, for
though they cry unto me in their trouble, yet will I not hear them.

O thou beloved, why do thou so shameful great blasphemies in my house?
Even as though that holy flesh might absolve the, specially when thou have
made thy boste of thy wickedness. The Lord called the a grene olyue tree, a
fair one, a fruitful one, a goodly one: but now that there is a contrary
report of the abroad, he will burn the up, and destroy thy branches. For
the Lord of hosts that planted the, has devised a glage for the (O thou

wrath, in that ye did service unto Baal.

Therefore I will beseech the now, Esaias.liii.c.
O Lord of hosts, thou ryghtous judge, thou that tryest the reins and the

The Lord therefore spoke thus of the cityzyns of Anathoth, Sapien.ii. d.
Jeremy.xx.c
that sought to slay me, saying: Preach not unto us in the name of the Lord,
or else thou shall dye of our hands. Thus (I say) spoke the Lord of hosts:
Behold, I will vysyte you. Your young men shall perysshe with the sword,
your sons and your daughters shall utterly dye of hongre, so that none

year of their visitacion.

The Prophet marueyleth at the prosperitye of the wicked, although he

against Curates and preachers that reduce the people. The Lord threteneth

it.

CAPI. XII.
O Lord, thou art more ryghtous, then Job.xxi. a. Abacuc.i. b.
and that it goes so well with them which (without any shame) offend and live
in wickedness? Thou plantest them, they take root, they grow, and bring
forth fruit. They booste much of the, yet do thou not punish them. But
thou Lord (to whom I am well known) thou that have seen, and proved my heart,
take them away, like as a flock is carried to the slaughter house, and appoint
them for ye day of slaughter.

How long shall the land mourn, and all the herbs of the field perish, for
the wickedness of them that dwell therein?



Saying thou art werye in runnynge with the footmen, how will thou then run
with horses? In a peaceable sure land thou may be safe, but how wylt thou do
in the ^urious pride of Iordane? for thy brethren and thy kyneed have all
together despised the, and cried out upon the in thine absence. Bileue them
not, though they speak fair words to the. As for me (say I) I have
forsaken mine own dwelling place, and left mine heritage. By life also that
I loved so well, have I given in to the handis of mine enemies. Mine heritage
is become unto me, as a lion in the wod. It cried out upon me, therefore have I
forsaken it. Mine heritage is unto me, as a speckied bird, a bird of diverse
colors is upon it. Go hence and gather an yt beesies of the field together,
that they may eat it up.



The destroyers come over the heeth every way, for the sword of the Lord
shall consume from the one end of the land to the other, and no flesh shall
have test. They shall sow where, and repe thorns. They shall take heritage in
possession, but it shall do them no good. And ye shall be confounded of your
own wynnynges, because of the great wrath of the Lord.



And if they (namely that trouble my people) will learn the ways of them to
swear by my name: The Lord lives (like as they learned my people to swear by
Baal) then shall they be reckened among my people. But if they will not obey,
then will I rote out the same folk, and destroy them says the Lord.

The destruccyon of the Jews is prefygured, and their sparplynge abroad. why
Israel was received to be the people of God, and why they were forsaken.

For like as the man of Inde may change his skin,

This shall be your portion, and the portion of your measure, wherewith ye

Doub^lesse our own wickedness reward

Then spoke the Lord, concerning this people, that have pleasure to go so
^ymbly with their fece, and leave not of, and therefore displease the Lord: in
so much that he will now bring again to remembrance all their misteces, and
punish all their sins. Yea, even thus said the Lord unto me: Iermy.vii.c.
Thou shalt not pray to do this people good. For though they cast, I will not
hear their prayers. And though they offce burn offeringes and sacrifices, yet
will not I accept them. For I will destroy them with the sword, honger and
pestilence. Then answered I: O Lord God, ye Propheces say unto them: Tush, ye
shall se Iere.xxiii. a.xxvii.c.xxix. e.
but the Lord shall give you continual rest in this place.

And the Lord said unto me: The Propheces preach lies unto them in my name.
I have not spoken with them, neither gave I them any charge, neither did I send
them: yet they preach unto you false visions, charmynge, vanity, and
disceytfulnesse of their own heart: Therefore thus says the Lord: As for
those Propheces that preach in my name (whom I nevertheless have not sent)
and that say: Tusshe there shall neither battle ne ho^ger be in this land:
With sword and with hongre shall those Prophets perysh, and the people to
whom they have preached, shall be cast out of Jerusalem, dye of hongre, and be
stayne with the sword (and there shall be no man to burye them) both they and
their wynes, their sons and their daughters. For thus will I pour their
wickedness upon them. This shall thou say also Thren.i. f. ^ ii. f.
Mine eyes shall weep without ceasynge, day and night. For my people shall be
destroyed with great harm, and shall perisshe with a great plage, for if I goo
in to the field: lo, it lies all full of slain men: If I come in to the
city: lo, they be all famisshed of hongre.

Yea, their Prophets also and prestes shall be led in to an unknown land.

Haste thou then utterly forsaken Judah? (said I) Do thou so abhor Sion? Or
have thou so plaged us, that we can be healed no more? We looked for peax,

But if ye will not be obedient unto these commandments, I swear by mine
own self (says the Lord) this house shall be waste. For thus has the
Lord spoken upon the kings house of Judah: Thou art the head, as Balaad is
in Lybanus: What will thou lay of it, if I make the not so waste (and thy
cities also) that no man shall dwell therein? I will prepare a destroyer with his
weapons for the, to hew down thy special Cedre trees, and to cast them in
the fire.

(...).xxix. (...).xx^^i. b (...).vii. d
wherefore has the Lord done thus unto this noble city? Then shall it be
answered: * because they have broken the covenant of the Lord their God, and
have worshypped and served strange gods. Mourn not over the deed, and be
not woe for them, but be sorry for him that departs away: for he comes not
again and sees his native country no more. For thus says the Lord, as
touching Selum the son of Josiah king of Judah, which raygned after his
father, and is carried out of this place: He shall never come hither again,
for he shall dye in the place, whereunto he is led captyue, and shall se this
land no more. Do worth him, that buyldeth his house

Did not thy father eat and drink, and prospere well, as long as he dealt
with equite and ryghtousnes? Yea when he helped the oppressed and poor to
their right then prospered he well.

From whence came this, but only because he had me before his eyes, says the
Lord. Nevertheless, as for thine eyes and thine heart, they look upon
covetousness, to shed innocent blood, to do wrong and vyolence. And therefore
thus says the Lord against Iehoakim, the son of Josiah king of Judah: They
shall not mourn for him (as they use to do) alas brother, alas sister: neither
shall they say unto him: Alas sir, alas for that noble prince. But as an Ass
shall he be buried, corrupt and be cast without the gates of Jerusalem.



As truly as I live (says the Lord) Though Conaniah the son of Iehoakim

O thou earth, earth, earth: hear the word of the Lord: Write this man
among the outlawes, for no prosperyte shall this man have all his life long.
Neither shall any of his sede be so happy, as to sit upon the seat of David,
and to bear rule in Judah.

He speaks against evil curates that make havoc of the flock of the
Lord. Of the conuersyon of the remnau^t of the Jews to the faith. The
coming of the true shepherde Christ is prophesyed. Against false prophets,
when a prophet preaches the word of God. God conuerteth the hertes of the
hearers. Against prophets that preach lies under the name of God. The
miracles of false prophets.

WOE be unto the shepherdes, that destroy and scatre my flock, says the
Lord. Wherefore, this is the commandment Eze.xxxiiii. ^.
unto ye shepherdes that feed my people: Ye scatre and thrust out my flock,
and look not upon them. Therefore now will I vysyt the wickedness of your
ymaginacyons, says the Lord: And will gather to gyther the remnaunt of my
flock from all lands that I had driven them unto, and will bring them
again to their pastures, that they may grow and increase. I will set
shepherdes also over them, which shall feed them: They shall no more fear and
dread, for there shall none of them Iere.xxxiii.c. Esaias.iiij. b xl.c. and.xlv.v.
the time comes, says the Lord, that I will raise up the ryghtous branch

set up equity and ryghtousnesse a gain in earth.

In his time shall Judah be saved and Israel shall dwell without fear. And this
is the name that they shall call him: even the Lord our ryghtous maker. And
therefore behold, the time comes, says the Lord, that it shall no more be
said: the Lord lives, which brought the children of Israel out of the land
of Egypt: But the Lord lives, which brought forth, and led the sede of the
house of Israel, out of the North land, and from all countries where I had
scatered them and they shall dwell in their own land again.

My heart breaks in my body, because of the false Prophets, all my bones
shake: I am become like a dronken man (that by the reason of wine can take no
rest) for very fear of the Lord, Ierem.xiiii. a
and of his holy words: Because the la^d is full of aduouterers, where through
it is destroyed and mourns, and the pleasant pastures of the desert are
dried up. Yea the way that men rake, is wicked,

I have seen also among the Prophets of Jerusalem foul aduoutrye, and
presumptuous lies. They take the most shameful men by the hand, flatrynge
the^, so that they can not return from their wyckednes. All these with their
cytezyns are unto me, as Sodom, and as the inhabytoures of Gomorre.

Jeremy.ix. b
Therefore thus says the Lord of Hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I
will feed them with wormwod, and make them drink the water of gall. For from
the prophets of Jerusalem is the syckenes of ypocrysye come into all the land.

Ieremi.xxvii and.xxiii. b.
And therefore the Lord of Hosts gives you this warning: Hear not the words
of the prophets, that preach unto you, and disceyue you: for they speak the
meaning of their own heart, and nor out of the mouth of the Lord. They say
unto them, that despise me: Jeremy.xii. a Sophon.xii. a
The Lord has spoken it: Tus^, ye shall prospere right well. And unto all
them, that walk after the just of their own heart, they say: Tushe, there
shall no misfortune happen you. For who has sytten in the counsel of the
Lord, that he has herd and understand, what he is about to do: Who has
marked his device, an herd it? Behold, the stormy wether of the Lord (that
is, his indignacion) shall go forth, and shall fall down upon the heed of the
ungodly. And the wrath of the Lord shall not turn again, till he perform
and fulfill the thought of his heart. And in the latter days ye shall know his
meaning.

I have not sent these Prophets (says the Lord) and yet they ran. I have
not Iere. (...) xxvii. ^ xx^.c
But if they had continued in my counsel and herd my works: they had
turned my people from their evil ways and wicked ymaginacions. Am I then God
that sees but the thing, which is nyghe at hand, and not that is far of?
says the Lord. May any man hyde him self so, that I shall not se him? says
the Lord. Do not I fulfill heaven and earth? says the Lord. I have herd
well enough, what the Prophets say, that preach lies in my name, saying: I
have dreamed, I have dreamed. How long will this continue in the prophets
hertes, to tell lies, and to preach the crafty subtylte of their own heart?
Whose purpose is (with the dreams that every one tell) to make my people
forgette my name, as their fore fathers did, when Baal came up. The prophet
that has a dream, let him tell it: and he that understands my word, let
him show it faithfully.

For what has chafe and wheat to do together? says the Lord. Is not my
word

If this people, either any Prophet or priest ask the, and say: what is the
burden of the Lord? Thou shalt say unto them: What burden? Therefore will I
cast you fro me (says the Lord) because ye your selves are a burden. And
the Prophet, pressed or people that uses this term (the burden of the Lord)
him will I vyset, and his house also.

But thus shall ye say, every one to an other: What answer has the Lord
given?

Thus shall every man say to the prohetes: what answer has the Lord given
the? Or what says the Lord? And nor ones to name the burden of the Lord.
Therefore thus says the Lord: For so much as ye have used this term (the
burden of ye Lord) where as I not withstandinge sent unto you and forbade you
to speak of the Lords burden.

Behold therefore I will repute you as a burden, and will cast you out of my
presence: yea and the city also, that I gave you and your fathers: (...) x.c.
and will bring you to an everlasting confusion, and in to such a shame as shall
never be forgotten.

The vysyon of the two pannyers of fygges. The first vysyon signyfyeth, that
part of the people should be brought again from captyuytye. The second,
that Sedechias and the rest of the people should be destroyed.

CAPI. XXIIII.
(...).xxiii. d
In the one maunde were very good fygges, even like as those that be first
type. In the other maunde were very naughtye fygges, which might not be
eaten, they were so evil. Then said the Lord unto me: What see thou
Ieremye? I said: fygges, whereof some be very good, and some so evil, that no
man may eat them.

(...)
for they shall return unto me with their hole heart.

And like as thou know the noughtye fygges, (...). d.
which may not be eaten, they are so evil: Even so will I (says the Lord)
let Sedechias the king of Judah, (ye and all his princes, and the resydue of
Jerusalem that remain over in this land, and them also that dwell in Egypt)
to be vexed and plaged

Ieremye prophecyeth, that they shall be in captyuytye three score and ten
years, because they contemned and despised the word of God. He shows that
after three score and ten years, the Babylonyans should be destroyed. The
destruction of all nacyons is prophesied. He moves the preastes of the nacyons
to waylynge.

CAPI. XXV.
A Sermon that was given unto Ieremye,

From the thyrtenth year of Josias the son of Amon king of Judah, unto this
present day (that is even three and twenty year) the word of the Lord has been committed unto me. And so I have spoken to you, I have risen up earlye, I
have given you warning in season, but ye would not hear me. Though the Lord
has sent his servants, all the Prophets unto you in season: Yet would ye
not obey, ye would not enclyne your ears to hear.

He said: turn again every man from his evil way, and from your wicked
ymagynacions, iiii. Re.xvii. and Iere.xviii.c Iere.xxxv.c.
that the Lord promised you and your forefathers: and go not unto strange
gods, serve them not, worship them not, and anger me not with the works of
your hands: then will not I punysshe you. Nevertheless, ye would not hear
me (says the Lord) but have defiled me with the works of your hands, to
your own great harm.

Wherefore thus says the Lord of hosts: Because ye have not harkened unto my
word: so, I will send out and call for all the people that dwell in the
North, says the Lord, and will prepare Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon my
servant, and will bring them upon this land, and upon all that dwell
therein, and upon all the people that are about them, and will utterly root
them out. I will make of them a wilderness, a mockage, and a contyauall
deserte.

Moreover, I will take from them the Ieremi.xxix.c ii. Pa.xxx ci. d i. Eldr.i.
^. Daniel.ix. a.
When the three score and ten years are expyred, I will vysyte also the
wickedness of the king of Babylon and his people, says the Lord: yea and the
land of the Caldees, and will make it a perpetual wilderness, and will fulfill
all my words upon that land, which I have devised against it: yea, all that
is written in this book, which Ieremye has prophesied of all people: so that
they also shall be subdued unto diverse nations and great kings, Job.xxxiiii. b
for I will acquyte toeym according to these deeds and works of their own
hands.

For thus has the Lord God of Israel Esay^. (...)
Take this wine cup of indignacion fro my hand, Psalm.lxxv. b.
that thou may cause all the people to whom I send the, for to drink of
it: that when they have dronken thereof, they may be mad and out of their
wits, when the sword comes, that I will find among them. Then took I the
cup from the Lords hand, and made all the people, drink thereof, unto whom
the Lord had seen me.



Ierem.xlix. b Ezech.lx. b i. Pet.iiii.c.
and that shortly. For lo, I begin to plage the city that my name is given
unto: thyncke ye then, that I will leave you unpunished? Ye shall not goo
quyte. For why, I call for a sword upon all ye inhabitauntes of the earth,
says the Lord of hosts.

Joel iii.c (...).
Therefore tell them all these words, and say unto them: The Lord shall cry
from about, and let his voice be herd from his holy dwelling place. With a
great noise shall he cry from his court regal. He shall give a great
voice (like the grape gatherees) and the sound thereof shall he herd unto the
ends of the world. For the Lord has a judgment to give upon all people,
and will hold his court of justice with all flesh and punysshe the ungodly,
says the Lord.

For thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold, Ieremi.xxx. ^
and a great stormye water shall arise from all the ends of the earth. And
the same day shall the Lord him self slay them, from one end of the
earth to an other. There shall no lamentacion be made for any of them, none
gathered up, none buried: but shall lie as dung upon the ground.

Mourn, o ye shepherdes, and cry: sprinkle your selves with ashes, o ye
rams of the flock: for the time of your slaughter is fulfilled, and ye shall
fall like vessels conningly made for pleasure.

The shepherdes shall have no way to fle, Psalm. ^
and the rams of the flock shall not escape. Then shall the shepeherdes cry
horriblye, and the rams of the flock shall mourn: for the Lord shall
consume their pasture, and their best feldes shall lie deed, because of the
horrible wrath of the Lord.

They shall forsake their foldes, like as a lion. For their lands shall be
waste, because of the wrath of the destroyer, and because of his fearful
indignacion.

Ieremye moves the people to amendment. He is taken of the Prophets and
Preastes, and brought to judgment. He being accused before the Princes,
answers: that he had preached only the words of God. The rulers and the
people deliver Ieremye, against the wylles of the Prestes and Prophets: after
the exemple of Ezechias, which had delivered Micheas, that had preached the
same things that Ieremye had preached. Vriah the Prophet is killed of Ioakym,
contrary to the will of God.

CAPI. XXVI.
IN the beginning of the raygne of Ioakim

And after this manner shall thou speak us to them: Thus says the Lord: if ye
will i. Re^. ^ii* ^
and will make this city to be abhorred of all the people of the earth. And
the priests, the Prophets, and all the people herd Ieremye preach these
words in the house of the Lord.

Now when he had spoken out all the words, that the Lord commanded him
to preach unto all the people, then the priests, the Prophets, and all the
people laid hold upon him, and said: thou shalt dye. How dare thou be so
bold, as to say in the name of the Lord: it shall happen to this house as it
did to Siloh: and this city shall be so waste, that no man shall dwell therein?

And when all the people had gathered about Ieremye in the house of the Lord,
the princes of Judah herd of this rumoure, and they came forthwith out of the
kings palace in to the house of the Lord, ^ Reg.xv. g (...)* xxxvi. b.
and sat the^ down before the new door of the Lord. (...).xix. a
This man is worthy to dye, for he has preached against this city, as ye your
selves have herd with your ears.

(...).vii. a
and be obedyente unto the voice of the Lord your God: so shall the Lord
repent of the plage, that he had devised against you. Now as for me: I am in
your hands, do with me as ye think expediente and good.

But this shall ye know: if ye put me to death, ye shall make your selves, this
city and all the inhabitours thereof, gylty of innocent blood. (...).xxii.c
For this is of a truth: that the Lord has sent me unto you, to speak al
these words in your ears.

(...)
which was a Prophet under Ezechias king of Judah, spoke to all the people of
Judah: Thus says the Lord (...).c
Syon shall be plowed like a field, Jerusalem shall be an heap of st^nes, and
the hill of the Lords house, shall be turned to an hye wodde.

Did Ezechias the king of Judah and the people of Judah put him to death for
this? No verily, but rather feared the Lord, and made their prayer unto him.
For which cause also the Lord repented of the plage that he had devised
against them. Should we then do such a shameful deed against our souls? There
was a Prophet also, that preached styflye in the name of the Lord called Vriah
the son (...) ^^^i. d
the king went above to slay him. When Vriah perceived that, (...)
he was afraid, and fled, and departed in to Egypt.

Then Ioakim the king sent servants in to the land of Egypt: Namely Elnathan
ye son of Achabor, and certain men with him in to Egypt, which fetched
Vriah out of Egypt, and brought him unto king Ioakim that slew him with the
sword, and cast his deed body in to the common peoples grave. But Akikam the
son of Saphan helped Ieremye that he came not in to the hands of the people to
be slain.

Ieremye, at the commandment of the Lord, sends bonds to the King of
Judah, and to the other Kings that were nyghe, whereby they are monysshed to
become subjects unto Nabuchodonosor. He warns the people and the Kings and
rulers, that they believe not false Prophets.

CAPI. XXVII.
IN the beginning of the raygne of Ioakim

And now will I deliver all these lands Eccle.x. a Iudicum.xi. d Iere.xxxii.
a Daniel.liiii.c Ieremi xxv. b Ierem.xxii. b xxxv.ii. a and xiii.c.
The beestes also of the field shall I give him to do him service. And all
people shall serve him, and his son, and his chyldes children, until the
time of the same land be come also: yea many people, and great kings shall
serve him.

Moreover, that people and kingdom which will not serve Nabuchodonosor, and
that will not put their necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon: the same
people will I vysyte with the swearde, with honger, with pestylence, until I
have consumed them in his hands, says the Lord. And therefore follow not
your Prophets, sothesayers, expounders of dreams, Iermi.xxiii.c xxxix. b.
charmers and wytches, which say unto you: ye shall not serve the king of
Babylon. For they preach you lies: to bring you far from your land, and
that I might cast you out, and destroy you. But the people that put their
necks under the yoke of ye king of Babylon and serve him, those I will let
remain still in their own land (says the Lord) and they shall occupy it
and dwell therein.

All these things told I Sedechias king of Judah, and said: Put your necks
under Ier.xxxviii.c
and serve him and his people, that ye may live. Why, wylt thou and thy people
perish with the sword, with honger, with pestylence: like as the Lord has
devised for all people that will not serve the king of Babylon? Iere.xxiii.c
Iere.xxix. b
Therefore give no care unto those Prophets (that tell you: Ye shall not serve
the king of Babylon) for they preach you lies, Ierem.xiiii.c xiii. d. and
xxix. b.
neither have I sent them, says the Lord: how be it they are bold, falsely
to prophecye in my name: that I might the sooner drive you out, and that ye
might perish with your preachers.



For thus has the Lord of hosts spoken concerning the pyllers, the lauer,
the seat and the residue of the orname^tes that yet remayn in this city,
which Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon took not, when he carried away
Iechoniah the son of Ioakim king of Judah, with all the power of Judah and
Jerusalem, from Jerusalem unto Babylon captyue.

iiii. Re.xxv. a
Yea, thus has the Lord of Hoostes the God of Israel spoken, as touching
the resydue of the ornaments of the Lords house, of the king of Judas house,
and of Jerusalem: They shall be carried unto Babylon, and there they shall
remain until I vysyte them, says the Lord. Then will I bring them hither
again. And this was done in the same year: even in the bebegynnyng of the
raygne of Sedechias king of Judah.

The false prophecye of Hananiah the Prophet. Ieremye shows yt the Prophecye
of Hananiah is false, by the exemple of other Prophets. He being inspyred of
the Lord, reproves Hananiah, Prophecyinge his death.

CAPI. XXVIII.
But in the fourth year of the raygne of

Yea, I will bring again Iechoniah ye son of Ioakim the king of Judah him
self, with all the prisoners of Judah (that are carried unto Babylon) even in to
this place, says the Lord, for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.

Then the Prophet Ieremye gave answer

And Hananiah the Prophet took ye cheyne Deuteronomy.xviii* ^ Num^.xv^
and brake it, and with that said Hananiah that all the people might hear:
Thus has the Lord spoken: Even so will I break the yoke of Nabuchodonosor
king of Babylon, from the neck of all nations, yea and that within this two
year. And so the Prophet Ieremye went his way.

Now after that Hananiah the Prophet had taken the cheyne from the Prophet
Ieremies beck, and broken it: The word of the Lord came unto the Prophet
Ieremye saying: Go and tell Hananiah these words: Thus says the Lord: Thou
have broken the cheyne of wod, but instead of wod thou shall Ierem^.x^
Then said the Prophet Ieremye unto that Prophet Hananiah: Hear me (I pray
the) Hananiah: The Lord has not sent the, but thou bryngest this people in
to false bylefe. And therefore thus says the Lord: behold, I will send the
out of the land, and within a year thou shalt dye, because thou have falsely
spoken against the Lord. Hananiah ^eth.
So Hananiah the Prophet died the same year in the seventh month.

The Epistle of Ieremye, sent unto them that were in captyuytye in Babylon. He
prophecyeth their return from captyuytye after three score and ten years. He
prophecyeth the destruction of the King and of the people that remained in
Jerusalem. He threteneth two Prophets that seduced the people. The death of
Semeiah the Nehelamyte is prophesied.

CAPI. XXIX.
THis is the copye of the lettre, that Ieremye after that time that king
Iechoniah, and his queen, his chamberlaynes the princes of Judah and Jerusalem,
the workemasters of Jerusalem were departed thither. Which lettre Elasah the
son of Saphan and Gamariah the son of Helkiah did bear, whom Sedechias ye
king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon. These
were the words of Ieremyes lettre:

Thus has the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel spoken unto all the
prisoners that were led from Jerusalem unto Babylon: build your houses to
dwell therein: plant you gardens, that ye may enjoy the fruits thereof: take
you wives to bear you sons and daughters: provide wives for your sons,
and husbands for your daughters, that they may get sons and daughters,
and that ye may multiplye there. Labor (...) xiiii* c
the God of Israel: Let not those Prophets and sothesayers that be among

(...).xxv c (...).xxvi. (...). a (...). a
But thus says the Lord: When ye have fulfilled three score and ten years at
Babylon, I will bring you home, and of mine own goodness I will carye you
hither again unto this place. For I know what I have devised for you, says
the Lord. My thoughts are to give you peax, and not trouble (which I give
you all redye) and that ye might have hope again. Ye shall cry unto me, ye
shall go and call upon me, and I shall

But where as ye say, that God have raised you up prophets at Babylon: thus
has the Lord spoken (concerning the king that sytteth in the stole of David,
and all the people that dwell in this city, your brethren that are not gone
with you in to captivity.) Thus, (...)
I say, speaks the Lord of hosts: Behold, I will send a sword, hongre,
and pestilence upon them, and will make them like untimely figs, that may
not be eaten for bitterness. And I will persecute them with ye sword, with
hongre and death.

I will deliver them up to be vexed of all kingdoms, to be cursed, abhorred,
laughed to scorn, and put to confusion of all the people among whom I have
scattered them: and that because they have not ben obedient unto my
commandments, says the Lord, which I sent unto them by my servants the
Prophets. I stood up early, and sent unto them, but they would not hear,
says the Lord.

Hear therefore the word of the Lord,

For they have not only defiled their neighbors iiii. Res.xi. a ii. Par.xxiii.
a
that sholdest be the chief in the house of the Lord above all Prophets, and
preachers, and that thou myghtest put them in prison, or in the stackes. How
happens it then, that thou have not reproved Jeremy of Anathoth, which never
leaves of his prophecyinge?

And beside all this, he has sent us word unto Babylon, and told us
plainly, that our captivity shall long endure: that we we should build us
houses to dwell therein, and to plant us gardens that we may enjoy the fruits
thereof. Which lettre Sophoniah the priest did read, and let Ieremye the
Prophet hear it.

Then came the word of the Lord unto Ieer.xxviii.c
Send word to all them that are in captivity, on this manner: Thus has the
Lord spoken concerning Semeiah the Nehelamyte: Because that Semeiah has
prophesied unto you without my commission, and brought you in to a false hope,
therefore thus the Lord does certifye you: Behold, I will visyte Semeiah the
Nehelamyte, and his seed: so that none of his shall remain among this people,
and none of them shall se the good that I will do for this people, says the
Lord. For he has preached falsely of the Lord.

The return of the people from Babylon. God by his chastenynge shows that
the people is sinful. The destruction of the enemies of Israel.

CAPI. XXX.


Again, these words spoke the Lord concerning Israel and Judah: thus says ye
Lord: We hear a terrible cry, fear and disquietnesse. For what else does
this signify, that I se? Namely that all strong men smite every man his hand

generacions of Israel, and they shall be my people.

He prophecyeth that the people of Israel shall be restored again unto their
prosperytye. To be turned from sin is the gift of God. The birth of Christ
is prophesied. All the wicked shall dye in their wyckednes. The new Testament

Thou shall plant vynes again upon the hills of Samaria, and the grape

them, with the women that be great with child, and such as be also

redeem Jacob, and ryd him from the hand of the vyolent. And they shall come,
and rejoice upon the hyl of Syon, and shall have plentuousnes of goods, which
the Lord shall give them: Namely, wheat, wine, oil young sheep and calves.
And their conscience shall be as a well watered garden, for they shall no more be
hongry.



Thus says the Lord: (...).iii. ^ (...)
The voice of heaviness, weeping and lamencion came into heaven: even of Rachel
mourning for her children, and would not be comforted because they were away.

But now says the Lord: leave of from weeping and cryinge, witholde thine
eyes from tears, for thy labor shall be rewarded says the Lord. And they
shall come again out of the land of their enemies: Yea even thy posterite
shall have consolacion in this (says the Lord) that thy children shall come
again in to their own land.

Moreover I herd Ephraim, that was led away captyue, complain on this manner:
O Lord, thou have correct me, and thy chastenynge have I received, as an
untamed calfe.

Convert thou me, and I shall be converted, for thou art my Lord God: Yea as
soon as thou turnest me, I shall refourme my self: and when I understand, I
shall smite upon my thyghe. For verelye I have committed shameful things: O
let my youth bear this reprofe and confusyon.



For thus says the Lord of Hosts the

Behold (says the Lord) the days come, that I will ^owe the house of Israel
and the house of Judah, with men and with catel. Yea it shall come thereto, that
like as I have gone about in times pass to rote them out, to scatre them,
to break them down, to destroy them and chasten them: Even so will I also go
dylygently about, to build them up again and to plant them says the Lord.

Then shall it no more be said: Ezech.xviii. ^
the fathers have eaten a sower grape, and the childrens teth are set on edge:
for every one shall dye for his own mysdede, so that who so eats a sour
grape, his teeth shall be let on edge.

Behold, the days come (says the Lord) that I will make a new covenant
with the Hebre.x. d. Esaye.li. b. Iere.xxiiii. b and.xxx. o.
when I took them by the hand and led them out of the land of Egypt: which
covenant they brake, wherefore I punysshed them sore, says the Lord: But this
shall be the couenaunte that I will make with the house of Israel after those
days, says the Lord: I will plant my law in the inward parts of them,
and write it in their hertes, and will be their God and they shall be my people.

And from thence forth shall no man teach his neighbor or his brother, and
say: know the Lord: But they shall all know me, from the lowest unto the
highest, says the Lord. For I will forgive their misdeeds, Act.x. g.
and will never remember their sins any more.

Thus says the Lord which gave the sun to be a light for the day, and ye
moon and sterres to shine in the night: which moves ye see, so that the
floudes thereof wax fearce: his name is the Lord of Hosts. Like as this
ordinance shall never be taken out of my sight, says the Lord: So shall the
sede of Israel never cease, but always be a people before me.

Moreover, thus says the Lord: like as the heaven above can not be measured,
and not be sought out: So will I also not cast out the hole sede of Israel,
for that they have committed, says the Lord Behold, the days come says the
Lord, that the city of the Lord shall be enlarged from the tower of
Hananeel, unto the gate of the corner wall. ^i. Esdra.iii. a zachar.xiiii. b
From thence shall the right measure be taken before her unto the hill top, of
Gareb, and shall come about Gaath, and the hole valley of the deed karcases, and
of the ashes, and all Ceremoth unto the broke of Cedron: and from thence unto
the corner of the horsgate toward the East, where as the Sanctuary of the
Lord also shall be set. And when it is now builded and set up of this
fasshyo^ it shall never be broken, nor cast down any more,

Ieremye is cast in to preson, because he prophesied that the city should be
taken of the king of Babylon. By the field that Ieremye bought at the
commandment of the Lord, is sygnifyed, that the people should come again
to their own possessyon. The people of God are his servants, and he is their
Lord. To fear God is Gods gift, to the intent that sins may be eschewed.

CAPI. XXXII.

As for Sedechias the king of Judah, he shall not be hable to escape the
Caldees, but surely he shall come in to the hands of the king of Babylon:
which shall speak with him mouth to mouth and one of the^ shall look an other in
the face. And Sedechias shall be carried unto Babilo^, and there shall he be,
until the time that I vysyt him, says the Lord. But if thou taken in hand
to fight against the Caldees thou shalt not prospere.

And so Hananeel mine uncles son came to me in the court: of the prison
(according to the word of the Lord) and said unto me: Bye my land (I pray
the) that lies in Anathoth in the country of Benjamin: for by heritage thou
have right to loose it out for thy self, therefore redeem it. Then I
perceived, that this was the commandment of the Lord, and so I losed the
land from Hananeel of Anathoth, mine uncles son, and weyed him there the
many: even seven sycles, and ten silver pens.

I caused him also to make me a writing

So I took the euydence with the copye (when it was orderlye sealed and red
over) and I gave the euydence unto Baruch ye son of Neriah the son of
Maasiah in the sight of Hananeel my cosen, and in the presence of the
witnesses, that be named in the euyde^ce, and before all the Jews that were
thereby in the court of the prison.

I charged Baruch also before them saying: the Lord of Hosts ye God of
Israel commands the, to take this sealed euyde^ce with the copye, and to lay
it in an erthen vessel, that it may long continue.

For the Lord of Hosts the God of Israel has determined, that houses, feldes
and vyneyardes shall be possessed again in this land.

Now when I had delivered the euyde^ce unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I
besoughte ye Lord, saying: O Lord God: It is thou yt have made heaven and
earth with thy great power and high arm, and there is nothing to hard for
the. Thou show mercy upon Exo.xxx^^. ^
thou recompensest the wickedness of the fathers, into the bosom of ye children
that come after them

Thou art the great and mighty God, whose name is the Lord of Hosts: great
in counsel, and infinite in thought: Thine eyes look upon all the ways o^
men's children, (...)
to reward every one after his way and according to the fruits of his
inuencions.

Thou haste done great tokens and wonders in the land of Egypt (as we se
this day) upon the people of Israel an upon those men: to make thy name
great, Exo. (...) the.x^^^^
as it is come to pass this day:

Thou have brought thy people of Israel out of the land of Egypt, with
tokens, with wonders, with a mighty hand, with a stretched out arm, and
with great terryblenesse: and haste given them this land, like as thou
had promised unto their fathers: Namelye that thou would give them a
land, that flows with milk and honye.

Now when they came therein, and possessed it, they followed not thy voice, and
walked not in thy law: but all that thou commaundedest them to do, that have
they not done, and therefore come all these plages upon them.

Behold, there are bulworkes made now against the city to take it: and it
shall be won of the Caldees that besiege it, with sword, with hongre and death,
and l^ke what thou have spoken, that same shall come upon them.



Then came the word of the Lord unto me, saying: Behold, I am the Lord God
of all flesh, is there any thing then to hard for me? Therefore thus said the
Lord: behold, I shall deliver this city in to the power of the Caldees, and
in to the power of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon, they shall take it.
(...) xv. b. b. (...).
For the Caldees shall come, and win this city, and set fire upon it, and
burn it: with the gorgyous houses, in whose parlers they have made sacrifyce
unto Baal, and poured drynck offeringes unto strange gods to provoke me unto
wrath.

For saying the children of Israel, and the children of Judah have wrought
wyckednes before me ever from their youth, what have they else done, but
provoked me with the worckes of their own hands? says the Lord.

Or what has this city been else, but a provoking of my wrath, ever sense
the day that I builded it unto this hour? Wherein I cast it out of my sight,
because of the great blasphemies of the children of Israel and Judah, which
they have done to provoke me: yea they, their kings, their princes, their
priests, their prophets, hole Judah, and all the citezins of Jerusalem.

^^aye.ii. d
and not their faces. They would not hear, to be reformed and correct. They
have set their gods in the house, that is hallowed unto my name, to defyle
it. They have builded high places for Baal in the valley of the children of
Hennom, (...).vii. a. d ^ Reg.xxi. a
to vow their sons and dougters unto Moloch: which I never commanded them,
neither came it ever in my thought, to make Judah sin with such abhomynacion.

Moreover thus has the Lord God of Israel spoken, concerning this city,
which (as ye your selves confess) shall be delivered into the hand of the
king of Babylon, when it is won with the sword, with honger and with
pestylence. Behold, I will gather them together from all lands, (...) xxx. a
wherein I have scatered the^ in my wrath, in my fearful and great
displeasure: and will bring the^ again unto this place, where they shall dwell
safelye. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. (...).xi.c


(...) ^x.c
that they may fear me all the days of their life, that they and their
children after them may prospere. And I will set up an everlasting covenant
with them Namelye: that I will never cease to do them good, and that I will
put my fear in their hertes, so that they shall not run away from me.

Yea I will have a lust and pleasure to do them good, and faithfully to plant
them in this land with my hole heart, and with all my soul.

For thus says the Lord: like as I have brought all this great plage upon
this people: so will I also bring upon them all the good, that have I promised
them. And men shall have their possessions in this land, whereof ye say now,
that it shall neither be inhabited of people ne of catell, but be delivered in
to the hands of the Caldees: Yea land shall be bought for money, and euyde^ces
made thereupon and sealed before witnesses in the country of Benjamin, and
round about Jerusalem: in the cities of Judah, in the cities that are upon the
mountains, and in them that lie beneth, yea and in the cities that are in the
deserte. For I will bring their prisoners hither again, says the Lord.

The Prophet is monysshed of the Lord, to pray for the delyueraunce of the
people, which the Lord promyseth. God forgyueth sins, and does gracyouslye
to the people, for his own renown. Of the birth of Christ. The kingdom of
Christ in the church shall never be ended.

CAPI. XXXIII.
Moreover the word of the Lord came Jeremy.xx^^*xxxii. a.
when he was yet bound in the court of the prison: Thus says the Lord,
which fulfylleth the thing that he speaks, the Lord which perfourmeth the
thing that he takes in hand even he, whose name is the Lord: thou have
Exodusxiiii. d i. Reg.vii. b.
cried unto me, and I have herd the: I hue showed grate an high things,
which were unknown unto you.

Thus (I say) spoke the Lord God of Israel, concerning the houses of this
city, and the houses of the kings of Judah: that they shall be broken through
the ordinance and weapons, when the Caldees come to besiege them: and they
shall be filled with the deed karcases of men, whom I will slaye in my wrath
and displeasure: when I turn my face from this city because of all her
wickedness. Behold, (says the Lord) I will heal their wounds and make
them hole, I will open them the treasure of peaxe and truth.

And I will return the captyuyte of Judah and Israel: and will set them up
again as they were before, From all misdeeds (wherein they have offended
against me) I will cleanse them: And al their blasphemies which they have done
against me, when they regarded me not. I will forgive them.

And this shall get me a name, a praise and honor, among all people of the
earth, ye say that it shall be a wilderness, wherein neither people ne catel
shall dwell: in like manner in the cytyes of Judah and without Jerusalem (which
also shall be so void, that neither people ne cattle shall dwell there) shall
the voice of gladness be herd again, the voice of the brydgrome and of the
bryde the voice of them that shall sing: Praise the Lord of Hosts, for he is
loving and his mercy endures for ever, and the voice of them that shall offer
up gifts in the house of the Lord. For I will restore the captyuyte of this
land, as it was before, says the Lord. Thus says the Lord of Hosts It
shall come yet thereto, that in this land, which is void from men and catell,
and in all the cytyes of the land, there shall be set up shepherdes cotages
^in the cities upon the mountains: and in the cytyes that lie upon the plain,
and in the deserte.

In the land of Benjamin, in the feldes of Jerusalem, and in the cytyes of
Judah shall the sheep be nombred again, under the hand of him, that tells
them, says the Lord. Iere.xiii. a. Iere.xxiii. a.
which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah. In
those days, and at the same time, I will bring forth unto David, the
branch of ryghtousnes, and he shall do equytie and rightousnesse in the land.
In those days shall Judah be helped, and Jerusalem shall dwell safe, and he
that shall call her is even God our ryghtuous maker. For thus the Lord
promyseth: David shall never want out, to sit upon the stole of the house of
Israel: neither shall the priests and Leuytes want one to offer always before
me burnt offerynges, to kyndle the meat offreynges, and to prepare the
sacryfyces.

And the word of the Lord came unto Gene.viii. d Iere.xxiii. a.
May the covenant which I have made with day and night be broken, that there
should not be day and night in due season? Then may my covenant also be
broken which I made with David my servant, and so he not to have a son to
reign in his Trone. So shall also the prestes and Levites never fail,
Gene.xv. a and.xxii.c.
but serve me. For like as the sterres of heaven may not be nombred, neither
the sand of the sea measured: so will I multyplye the sede of David my
servant, and of the Levites my mynysters.

Moreover, the word of the Lord came to Jeremy, saying: Consydrest thou not
what this people speaks? Two kynredes (say they) had the Lord chosen, and
those same two has he ^as^e away. For so far is my people come, that they
have no hope to come together any more, and to be one people again Therefore
thus says the Lord: If I have made no covenant with day and night, and
given no statute unto heaven and earth: then will I also cast away the sede
of David my servant: so that I will take no prince out of his sede, to rule
the posterite of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But yet I will turn again their
captivity, and be merciful unto them.

He threteneth that the city, and King Sedechias also, shall be given into
the hands of the King of Babylon. He rebukes them that brought suck of
their brethren into captyuytye, that were pardoned to go at their liberty.

CAPI. XXXIIII.
THese are the words which the Lord

Then spoke Ieremye the Prophethe all

These are the words that the Lord spoke unto Jeremy the prophet, when
Sedechias was agreed with all the people at Jerusalem, that there should be
proclaimed a lybertye: so that every man should let his servant and handmayde
go free, Hebrew and Hebruesse, and no Jew to hold his brother as a bond man.
Now as they had conse^ted even so they were obedyent, and let them go fre. But
afterward they repented, and took again the servants and handmaydens, whom
they had let go free, and so made the^ bond again.

For the which cause the word of the (...)
I made a couenau^te with your fathers, when I brought them out of Egypt
(that they should no more be bond men) saying: When seven years are out,
every man shall let his bought servant an Hebrew go free, if ye have served
him six years. But your fathers obeyed me not and herkened not unto me. As
for you, ye were now turned, and did right before me, in yt ye proclaimed,
every man to let his neighbor go free, and in that ye made a covenant before
me, in the temple that bears my name: But yet ye have turned your selves
again and blasphemed my name: In this, that every man has required his
servant and handmayden again, whom ye had let goo quyte and fre, and
compelled them to serve (...). b
and when there went through the two halfes thereof: The Princes of Judah, the
Princes of Jerusalem, the gelded men, the Prestes and all the people of the
land, which went through te two sides of the calfe. Those men will I give in to
the power of their enemies, and into the hands of them that follow upon their
lives.

And their deed bodies shall be meat for the fowls of the air, and bestes of
the field As for Sedechias the king of Judah and his Princes, I will deliver
them into the power of their enemies, and of them that desire to slaye them,
and into the hand of the king of Babylons host, which now is departed
from you: But through my commandment (says the Lord) they shall come
again before this city, they shall fight against it, win it, and burn
it. Moreover I will lay the cytyes of Judah so waste, that no man shall dwell
therein.

Goo unto the house of the Rechabites, and call them out, and bring them to
the house of the Lord in to some commodyous place, and give them wine to
drink. Then took I Iazaniah the son of Ieremye, the son of Habaziniah, and
his brethren, and all his sons, and the hot household of the Rechabites: and
brought them to the house of the Lord, into the closet of the children of
Hanan the son of Iegedaliah the man of God: which was by the closet of ye
Princes, that is above the closet of Maasiah the son of Selum, which is the
chief of the treasurye. And before the sons of the Ierem.xxix. ^
ye and your sons shall never drink wine, buyld no houses, sow no sede,
plant no vynes, yea ye shall have no vynyardes: but for all your time ye
shall dwell in tents, that ye may live long in the land wherein ye be
strangers.

Thus have we obeyed the commandment, of Ionadab the son of Rechab our
father: in all that he has charged us, and so we drink no wine all our life
long: we nor our wives, our sons, and our daughters. Neither build we any
house to dwell therein, we have also among us neither vyneyardes, ne corn
land to sow: but we dwell in tents, we obey, and do according unto all that
Ionadab our father commanded us.

But now when Nabuchodonosor the Iere.xvii. a xxv. a.

I have sent my servants all the prophets unto you, I rose up early, and sent
you word, saying: O turn you, every man from his wicked way: amend your
lives, and go not after strange gods, to worship them: that ye may continue
in the land, which I have given unto you and your fathers, but ye would
neither hear me, ne follow me.

The children of Ionadab Rechabs son Prouer.i.c Esaye.xlv. b Jeremy.vii. b
nevertheless they would give me no answer. Jeremy also spoke unto the
household of the Rechabites: Thus says the Lord of Hosts the God of Israel:
For so much as ye have obeyed ye commandment of Ionadab your father, and
kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he has hydde^ you:
Therefore thus says the Lord of Hosts, Iere.xxxiii. e
the God of Israel: Ionadab the son of Rechab shall not fail, but have one
out of his stock, to stand always before me.

Baruch writes (as Iermye indyteth) the book of the curses against Judah and
Israel. He is sent with the book unto the people, and redeth it before them al.
He is called before the rulers, and redeth it before them also. The rulers

Iere.xviii. a
that I may forgive their offenses and sins.

Then did Ieremye call Baruch the son of Neriah, Ieremi.xlv. a
and Baruch wrote in the book at the mouth of Jeremy, all the words of the
Lord, which he had spoken unto him. And Jeremy commanded Baruch, saying:

So Baruch the son of Neriah did according unto all that Jeremy the Prophet
commanded him, reading the words of the Lord out of the book in the Lords
house And this was done in the fyfth year of Ioakim the son of Josiah king of
Judah, Ione.iii. a
in the nyneth month when it was commanded that all the people of Jerusalem
should fast, before the Lord, and they also that were come from the cytyes
of Judah unto Jerusalem.

which is beside the higher lofte of the door of the Lords house: that all the
people might hear. Now when Micheah the son of Gamariah the son of Saphan
had heard all the words of the Lord out of the book, he went down to the
kings palace into the Scribes chamber, for there all the princes were set:
Elisama the Scrybe. Dalaiah the son of Semei, Elnathan the son of Acabor,
Gamariah ye son of Saphan, Sedechias the son of Hananiah, with all the
princes. And Micheah told them all the words, that he heard Baruch read

of him, of his seed, and of his servants. More over all the evil that I have
promised them (though they herd me not) will I bring upon them, upon the
inhabitauntes of Jerusalem, and upon all Judah. Then took Ieremye an other
book, and gave it Baruch the Scribe, the son of Neriah, which wrote therein
out of the mouth of Ieremye: All the sermons that were in the first book,
which Ioakim the king of Judah did burn. And there were added unto them
many moo sermons then before.

Sedechias succedeth Cononiah. He sends unto Ieremye to pray for him.

Nevertheless Sedechias the king sent Iehucal the son of Selemiah, and
Sophoniah the son of Maasiah priest to the Prophet Jeremy, saying: O pray thou
unto the Lord our God for us. Now Ieremye walked fre among the people at that
time, and was not put in prison as yet. (...)
Pharaos host also was come out of Egypt, which when the Caldees that besieged
Jerusalem perceived, they departed from thence.



Now when the host of the Caldees was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of
the Egyptians army, Ieremye went out of Jerusalem toward the land of
Benjamin to do certain business there among the people. And when he came
under BenIamins port, there was a porter called Ieriah the son of Selemiah,
the son of Hananiah, which fell upon him, and took him, saying: thy mind is
to ^un to the Caldees.

Then said Jeremy: it is not so, I goo not

Moreover Ieremye said unto king Sedechias:

And therefore hear now, O my lord the king: let my prayer be accept before

not there. Then Sedechias the king commanded to put Jeremy in the fore entry
of the prison, and daily to be given him a cake of breed, and else no dight
meat, until all the breed in the city was eaten up. Thus Jeremy remained in
the fore entrye of the prison.

By the mocyon of the rulers, Ieremye is put in to a dongeon. At the request
of Abedmelech the Chamberlayne, the King comaundeth Ieremye to be brought
forth of the dongeon. Ieremye shows the King how he might escape death.

Who so remains in this city, shall perisshe, either with the sword, with
hongre or with pestilence: But who so falls unto the Caldees, shall escape
winning his soul for a pray, and shall live. For thus says the Lord. This
city (no doubt) must be delivered in to the power of the king of Babylon, and
he also shall win it. Then said the princes unto the king: Sir, we beseech you
let this man be put to death. For thus he discourageth the hands of the
souldyers that be in this city, and the hands of all the people, when he
speaks such words unto them.





Ier.xxxvii.c
And the king said unto Jeremy: I will ask the some what, but hyde nothing
fro me. Then Jeremy answered Sedechias: If I be plain unto the, thou will
cause me suffer death: if I give the counsel, thou will not follow me. So the
king swore an oath secretly unto Jeremy saying: As truly as the Lord lives,
that made us these souls, I will not slay ye, ne give the in to the hands of
them that seek after thy life.

Iere.xxvii. b.
and this city shall not be brent: yea both thou and thy household shall
escape with your lives. But if thou will not go forth to the king of Babylons
princes, then shall this city be delivered in to the hands of the Caldees
which shall set fire upon it, and thou shalt not be hable to escape them. And
Sedechias said unto Ieremye: I am afraid for the Jews, that are fled unto the
Caldees leest I come in their hands, and so

But Jeremy answered: No, they shall not betraye the: O harken unto the voice of
the Lord I (beseech the) which I speak unto the, so shalt thou be well, and
save thy life. But if thou will not go forth, the Lord has told me this
plainly: Behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judas house, shall
go out to the king of Babylons princes. For they think, that thou art
disceyued: and that the men in whom thou dyddest put thy trust, have mastred
the, and set thy fete fast in ye mire, and gone their way from the. Therefore
all thy wives with their children shall fle unto the Caldees, and thou shall
not escape their hands, but shall be the king of Babylons prisoner, and this
city shall be brent.

Then said Sedechias unto Jeremy: look

Nabuchodonosor besieges Jerusalem. Sedechias flees. He is taken of the
Chaldees. His sons are slain. His eyes are thrust out. Ieremye is provided

month, in the nyneth day of the month he brake in to the city.) Then all the
princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat them down under the port:
Neregel, Sarezar, Samegarnabo, Sarsachim, Rabsatis, Neregel, Sarezer, Rabmag,
with all the other princes of the king of Babylon. Iere.xx^^
And when Sedechias the king of Judah, with his souldyers saw them, they fled,
and departed out of the city by night through the kings garden, and through
the port that is bitwene the two walls, and so they went toward the
wilderness.

But the Chaldees host followed fast after them, and took Sedechias in the
field of Jericho, and brought him prisoner to Nabuchodonosor the king of
Babylon unto Reblath face at Reblath. And made Sedechias eyes to be put out,
and bound him with chains and and sent him to Babylon.

(...).xxv. b (...) xxxii. d
with the other houses of the people, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.
As for the remnaunt of the people that were in the city, and such as were
come to help them (what so ever was left of the common sort) Nabuzardan the
chief captain carried them to Babylon. But Nabuzardan the chief captain
let the rascal people, (and those that had nothing) dwell still in the
land of Judah, and gave them vyneyardes and corn feldes, at the same time.
Nabuchodonosor also the king of Babylon, gave Nabuzardan the chief capiteyn a
charge concerning Ieremye, saying: take and cherysshe him, and make much of
him: se thou do him no harm, but entreat him after his own desire.

So Nabuzardan the chief Capytayne, Nabusashan the chyefe chamberlayne,
Nergalsarezer the treasurer, (...) x^xviii. d
and all the king of Babylons lords sent for Ieremye, and caused him be fet
out of the fore entrye of the prison, and committed him unto Godollah the
son of Ahikam, the son of Saphan: that he should carry him home, and so he
dwelt

(...).xl. b.
Now while Jeremy lay yet bound in the fore entry of the prison, the word of
ye Lord came unto him, saying: Go and tell Abedmelech the Morian: Thus says
the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold, the cruel and sharp plage
that I have devised for this city, will I bring upon them, that thou shall se
it: but I will deliver the (says the Lord) and thou shall not come in the
hands of those men whom thou fear. For doubtless I will save the so that
thou shall not perish with the sword: but thy life shall be saved, and that
because thou have put thy trust in me, says the Lord.

Ieremye has license to go whyther he will. He dwells with the people that
remains at Jerusalem, over whom Godoliah rules. Iohanan prophecyeth death
unto Godoliah.

CAPI. XL.
(...)
when Nabuzardan ye chief captain had let him go fre from Ramah, whither he
had led him bound among all the prisoners, that were carried from Jerusalem and
Judah unto Babylon. The chief Captain called for Jeremy, and said unto him:
The Lord thy God spoke mightily before of the misery upon this place: Now the
Lord has sent it, and performed it as he had promised: for ye have sinned
against the Lord, and have not been obedient unto his voice, therefore comes
this plage upon you. Behold, I loose the bonds from thy hands this day: if
thou wylt now goo with me unto Babylon: up then, for I will se to the, and
Gene.xiii. ^ Toby.i. b.
But if thou will not goo with me to Babylon, then remain here. Behold, all
the land is at thy will, look where thou think convenient and good for the
to abide, there dwell. iiii. Re.xxv.c
If thou can not be content to dwell alone, then remain with Godoliah the son
of Ahicam the son of Saphan: whom the king of Babylon has made governor
over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people, or remain where
so ever it pleases the. So the chief Captain gave him his expe^ses with a
reward, Iere.xxxix.c
and let him go. Then went Jeremy unto Godoliah the son of Ahikam to Mazphah,
and dwelte there with him among the people that were left in the land.

Now when the Capitaynes of the host of iiii. Re.xxv.c
and do the king of Babylon service, so shall ye prospere. Behold, I dwell at
Mazphah to be an officer in the Caldees behalf, and to satisfye such as come
to us. Therefore gather you wine, corn and oil, and keep them in your ware
houses, and dwell in your cities that ye have in keeping.

Yea all the Jews also that dwelt in Moab

Moreover Iohanan the son of Kareah and all the capitaynes of the hosts,
that were scatred on every side in the land, came to Godoliah in Mazphah, and
said unto him: know thou not that Baalam king of the Ammonites has sent
Ismael the son of Nathaniah to slay the? But Godoliah the son of Ahicam bileued
the^ not. Then said Iohanan the son of Careah unto Godoliah in Mazphah these
words secretly: let me go, I pray the, and I will flee Ismael the son of
Nathaniah, so that no body shall know it. Wherefore will he kill the, that al ye
Jews which resort unto the might be scatred, and the remnaunt in Judah perish?
Then said Godoliah the son of Ahicam to Iohanan the son of Careah: Thou
shalt not do it, for they are but lies, that men say of Ismael.

Ismael kylleth Godolich gylefully, and many other with him. Iohanan follows

ten men that were sworn to him, start up and smote Godoliah the son of Ahicam
the son of Saphan with the sword and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had
made governor of the land. Ismael also slew all the Jews ye were with
Godoliah at Mazphah, and all the Caldees that he found there waytyng upon him.



iii. Reg.xxv.c
for fear of Baasa the king of Israel, and the same pyt did Ismael fill with
slain men. As for the remnau^t of the people, the kings daughters and all the
people yt were yet left at Mazphah, upon whom Nabuzardan the chief Captain
had made Godoliah the son of Ahicam gouernoure: Ismael the son of Nathaniah
carried them away prisoners toward the Ammonites.

Gene.xiiii.c i. Reg.xxx. b.
But when Iohanan the son of Careah and all they which had been capitaynes
over the kings host with him herd of al ye wickedness that Ismael the son
of Nathaniah had done, they took their companions and went out for to fight
with Ismael the son of Nathaniah, and found him by the waters of Rabim in
Gabaon. Now when all the people whom Ismael led captyue saw Iohanan the son of
Careah and all the other capitaynes of the host, they were glad. So al ye people
that Ismael had carried away from Mazphah, were brought again.

And when they returned they came to Iohanan Iere^^*
whom the king of Babylon had made governor in the land.

The Capitaynes took counsel of Ieremye what they ought to do. Ieremye
monyssheth the rest of the people not to go in to Egypt.

CAPI. XLII.
SO all the rulers, and Iohanan the son of Kareah, Iezoniah the son of
Osaiah Iere^^ ^ Iere.xx. ^
and said unto Ieremye the Prophet: hear our peticion, that thou may pray
for us unto the Lord thy God, and for the rest whereof there be very few
left of many, as thou see us: that the Lord thy God may show us away to
go in, and tell us what we should do. Then Ieremye the Prophet said unto to
them: I have herd you. Behold, I will pray unto God your Lord, as ye have
required me: and look what answer the Lord gives you, I shall certifye you
thereof, and keep nothing back from you. And they said unto Jeremy:
Iosu^.i.c.i. Ma^h. (...) Iere^^
The Lord of truth and faythfulnesse be our record that we will do all that the
Lord thy God commands us, whether it be good or evil. We will harken unto
the voice of our Lord God to whom we send the, that we may prospere, when we
have followed the voice of ye Lord our God.

And after ten days came the word of the Lord unto Jeremy. Then called he
Iohanan

Fear not the king of Babylon, of whom ye stand in awe: O be not afraid of
him, says the Lord: for I will be with you, to help you, and deliver you
from his hand. I will pardon you, I will have mercy upon you, and bring you
again in to your own land.





And forget not that I have warned you earnestly this day, else shall ye
begyle your selves. For ye sent me unto the Lord your God, and said: O pray
thou the Lord our God for us: and look what answer the Lord our God gives
the, that bring us again, and we shall do thereafter. Now have I showed and
declared unto you the voice of the Lord your God, for the which cause he
has sent me to you. If ye will not follow it, be sure that ye shall perysshe
with the sword, with hongre, and pestilence: even in the same place, where
your lust was to go and dwell.

Iohanan caryeth the remnaunt of the people in to Egypt, contrary to the mind
of Jeremy. Ieremye prophecyeth the destruction of Egypt.

CAPI. XLIII.
Now when Ieremye had ended all the

So Iohanan the son of Karee, and al Ieremi.xli. ^
women children, the kings daughters: al those that Nabuzardan the chief
Captain had left with Godoliah the son of Ahikam. They carried away also
the Prophet Jeremy, Baruch the son of Neriah, and so came in to Egypt: for
they were not obedient unto the commandment of God. Thus came they to Taphnis.

And in Taphnis the word of the Lord happened unto Ieremye, saying: Take
Ierem.xlvi. ^
and will set his seat upon the stones that I have hyd, and he shall sprede his
tent over them.

And when he comes he shall smite the land of Egypt with slaughter, with
prysonment,

He reproves the people for their Idolatrye. They that set light by the
threatenynge of the Lord, are chastened. The destruction of Egypt and the
Jews therein, is prophesied.

CAPI. XLIIII.
THis is the word that was showed to Ieremye concerning all the Jews, went
back to do sacrifyce and worship unto strange gods: whom neither they, nor
ye, Ierem.xxv. a and.x^ix.c.
your fathers have known. How be it I sent unto them my servants all the
Prophets: I rose up earlye, and sent unto them, and gave them warning: O do
no such abominable things, and things that I hate. But they would not follow
ne harken, to turn from their wickedness, and to do no more sacrifyce unto
strange gods.





Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: I am steadfastly
aduysed and determined to punysshe you, and to rote out all Judah. As for the
remnaunt of Judah that purposly went in to Egypt, Amos.ix. b
there to ease them of their misery: I will take them and they shall all be
destroyed. Jeremy.xlii.c and.xliiii. a.
In the land of Egypt shall they perysshe, being consumed with the sword
and with honger. For from the leest unto the most, they shall perysshe with
the sword and with honger. Moreover they shall be reuyled, abhorred, shamed,
and confounded.

For I will visyte them that dwell in Egypt, Ierem.xxxix.
as I have visited Jerusalem: with the sword, with hongre, and with
pestilence: so that none of the remnaunt of Judah, which are gone to dwell in
Egypt shall be left to come again in to the land of Judah, although they
think to come thither again, and to dwell there. For none shall come again,
but such as are fled away.

Iere^^ (...)
like as we and our fore fathers, our kings and our deeds have done in the
cities of Judah, and in the streets and feldes of Jerusalem. For then had we
plentiousnesse of vitayles, then were we in prosperity, and no misfortune came
upon us.

But sense we left to offer and to do sacrifyce i. Math* (...)
we have had scarceness of all things, and perysshe with the sword and
hongre. Last of all, when we women did sacrifyce and offered unto the Queen of
heaven, did we make her takes, and pour unto her drink offerynges, to do
her service, without our husbands wylles?

Then said Jeremy unto all the people, to the men, to the women, and to all the
folk which had given him that answer: Did not the Lord remember the
sacrifyces that ye, your fore fathers, Ier^^. ^
your kings and rulers (with all the people) have offered in the cities of
Judah, in the streets and land of Jerusalem? and has he not consdered this in
his mind? In so much that the Lord might no longer suffer the wickedness of
your inuencyons, and the abhomynable things which ye did? Esaye* ^^
Is not your land desolate and void, yea and abhorred so that no man
dwells therein any more, as it is come to pass this day?

Did not all this happen unto you because iii. Re. (...) Iere^^ (...)
iii.c.v.c. ^aruch*
and sinned against the Lord? Ye have not followed his voice, to walk in his
law, in his ordinances and statutes.

Yea this is the cause, that all mysfortune happened unto you, as it is come to
pass this day. Moreover, Ieremye spoke unto all the people, and to all the
women: Hear the word of the Lord all Judah, ye that be in the land of
Egypt: thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Ye and your wives
have spoken with your own mouth the thing that ye have fulfilled in deed.

Yea thus have ye said: We will not fail, Iere.li^i. ^
but do the thing that pleases us: we will do sacrifyce, and pour out
drink offreynges to the queen of heaven. Purposely have ye set up your own
good meanynges, and hastily have ye fulfilled your own intent. And therefore
hear the word of the Lord all Judah, ye that dwell in the land of Egypt.

Behold, I have sworn by my great Gene.x^
that my name shall not be rehearsed through any man's mouth of Judah, in all
the land of Egypt, to say: The Lord God lives, for I will watch to plage
them, and not for their wealth. And all the men of Judah that be in the land
of Egypt, shall perysshe with the sword, and with hongre, Iere. ^^
until they be utterly destroyed.

Nevertheless those that fled away for the swearde, shall come again in to
the land of Judah, but there shall be very few of them. And all the remnaunt of
Judah, that are gone into Egypt, there to dwell, shall know whose words shall
be found true: theirs or mine. Take this for a token, that I will viset you in
this place, says the Lord, and ye ye may know, how that I (without doubt)
will perform my purpose upon you to punyshe you. Behold, says the Lord, I
will deliver Pharao Hophrea king of Egypt in to the hands of his enemies,
that seek after his life: (...)
even as I gave Sedechias the king of Judah in to the hands of Nabuchodonosor
king of Babylon, which sought after his life.

Baruch is reproved of Ieremye.

after yt he had written these Sermons into a book at the mouth of Jeremy, in
the fourth year of Ioakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.

Thus says the Lord God of Israel unto the, O Baruch: In so much as thou
thoughtest thus, when thou wast writtyng. Woe is me, the Lord has given me
pain for my travail: I have weryed my self with syghinge, and shall I find
no rest? Therefore tell him O Jeremy, that the Lord says thus: Behold, The
thing that I have builded, will I break down again, and rote out the thing,
that I have planted, yea this hole land. And sekest thou yet promotion? Look
not for it, and desire it not. For I will bring a miserable plage upon al
flesh says ye Lord. But thy life will I give the for a pray whersoeuer thou
go.

which he spoke unto the Gentyles. These wores following preached he to the
Egypcians concerning the host of Pharao Necho king of Egypt, when he was in
Charcamis beside ye water of Euphrates: what time as Nabuchodonosor the king of
Babylon slew him, in the fourth year of of Ioakim the son of Josiah king of
Judah.

Ye make ready buckler and shylde, ye goo forth to fight: Ye harness your
horses and set your selves upon them: Ye set your salets fast on, ye bring
for the spears, ye scour your sweardes and put on your breest plates.

But alas, how happens it, that I se you so afraid? why shrynke ye back?
wherefore are your worthyes slain? Yea they run so fast away, that none of
them looks behind him. Fearfulness is fallen upon every one of the^ says
the Lord. The lightest of foot shall not fle away, and the worthyes shall not
escape.

Toward the North by the water of Euphrates,

For they say: We will go up, and will cover the earth: we will destroy the
cytyes, with them that dwell therein. Get you to horsback roll forth the
charettes, come forth ye worthies: ye Morians, ye Libeans with your bucklers,
ye Lideans with your bows: So shall this day be unto the Lord God of hosts,
a day of vengeance, that he may avenge

But in vain shalt thou go to surgerye for thy wound shall nor be stopped. The
Heythen shall near of thy shame, and the land shall be full of thy confusion:
for one strong man shall stomble upon an other, how then should they not fall
both together.

These are the words yt the Lord spoke

How happens it that thy mighty worthies are fallen? why stood they not
fast? Even because the Lord thrust them down. The slaughter was great, for
one fell ever still upon an other. One cried upon an other: Up, let us goo
again to our own people, and to our own natural country, from ye sword
of our enemy,

Cry even there: O Pharao king of Egypt,

They also shall fle away together, and not abide: for the day of their
slaughter and the time of their vysytacion shall come upon them.

The cry of their enemies shall make a noise, as the blaste of a trompet. For
they axes, as it were hewers down of wod. And they shall cut down her wodde,
says the Lord, without any discrecion. For they shall be mo in nombre then
the gresshoppers, so that no man shall be hable to tell them. The daughter of
Egypt shall be confounded, when she shall be delivered in to the hands of the
people of the North.

Moreover thus says the Lord of Hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will
viset that restless people of Alexandria, Pharao and Egypt, yea both their
gods and their kings: even Pharao, and all them that put their trust in
him. Yea I will deliver them into the hands of those, that seek after their
lives: Namely, into ye power of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon, and into
the power of his servants. And after all these things it shall be inhabited
as before time says the Lord.

The word of the Lord against the Moabites.

CAPI. XLVIII.
THus says the Lord of hosts the God Esaias. (...) Ezech. (...) Sop^^. Ios^^.x^
woe be to the city of Nabo, for it shall be laid waste, brought to contusyon
and taken. Yea thy strong city of Kariathiarim shall be brought to shame, and
afraid: Moab shall no more he had in honor: Wicked counsel shall be taken
upon Hesbon. Come (shall they say) let us rote them out, that they may be no
more among the nombre of the Gentyles, ye yt they may no more be thought upon:
Thus the sword shall persecute the: A voice shall cry from Horonaim: With
great wasting and destrucion, is Moab made desolace.

And this cry shall be herd in all her cities. At the going up unto Luith
there shall arise a lamentation: and down toward Horonaim, there shall be
herd a cruel and a deedly cry: Get you away, save your lives and be like
unto the hethe in the wyldernes. Ie^re. (...)
For because thou have trusted in thy strong holds and treasure, thou shall
be taken, Chamos with his prestes and princes shall go away into captyuytye.

The destroyer shall come upon all the cities, none shall escape. The valleys
shall be destroyed,

Make a token unto Moab, that she get her away spedely: for her cities shall
be made so desolate, that no man shall dwell therein. Cursed be he that both the
work of the Lord neglygently, and cursed be he that keeps back his swearde
from shedynge of blood.

Moab has never been rich and careless from her youth up, she has sytten
and taken her ease with her treasure. She was never yet put out of one vesell
into on other (that is) she never went away in to captyuyte, therefore her
cast remains, and her sauoure is not yet changed.

But lo, the time comes, says the Lord that I shall send her crussers to
trusse her up to prepare and season her vessels: yea her ta^kerdes rattell and
shake to and fro. And Moab shall be ashamed of Chamos, like as Israel was
ashamed of Bethel, wherein she put her trust.

Wherefore do ye think thus: i. Reg. (...)
we are mighty, and strong men of war? Moab Esaye.xv^
says the king, whose name is the Lord of Hosts. The destruction of Moab
comes on a pace, and her fall is at hand.

All her neigboures shall mourn for her, and all they that know her name,
shall say: O how happens it, that the strong staff and, the goodly rod is
thus broken? And thou daughter Dibon, come down from thy glory and sit in
pouertye. For he that destroys Moab, shall come up to the also, and break
down thy strong holds.



Mourn and cry, tell it out at Arnon, that Moab is destroyed. And myserye
shall come upon the plain land: Namely, upon Holo^, and Iahazah: upon
Mephaath and Dibon: upon Nabo and the house of Deblathaim, upon Cariathiarim
and Bethgamul, upon Bethmaon and Carioth, upon Bozrah and all the cities in the
land of Moab, whether they lie far or nere.

The horn of Moab shall be smytten down, and her arm broken, says the Lord.
Make her dronken, for she magnifyed her self above the Lord, that men may
clappe their hands at her vomit, and that she also may be laughed to scorn.
(...) xxvii. a
O Israel, shalt thou not laugh him to scorn, when he is taken among thieves?
Yea because of thy words that thou have spoken against him, thou shalt be
driven away. Ye Moabites shall leave the cities, and dwell in rocks of stone,
and become like doves, that make their nestes in holes.

(...).xvi. b. (...).
she is very high minded. I know her stoutnesse, her bostyng, her arrogance,
and the pride of her stomach, says the Lord. For her furiousnes may neither
uphold her with strength ne deed. Therefore shall there mourning be made for
Moab, and every man shall cry for Moabs sake: a lamentacion shall be made to
the men that stand upon the wall. So will I mourn for the also, O Iazer, and
for the. O thou vynyarde of Sabamah.

Thy wine branches shall come over the sea, and the branches of Iazer but
unto the sea: the destroyer shall break into thy harvest and grape gatheryng:
Mirth and chere shall be taken away from the tymbrefelde, and from the hole
land of Moab.

There shall be no sweet wine in the press, the treader shall have no stomach
to cry, yea there shall be none to cry unto him: which before time were herd
from Hesbon to Eleale and Iahaz, which lyfted up their voice from Zoar unto
Horonaim, that bullock of three year old. The waters also of Memrim

(...).
Moreover I will make Moab cease (says the Lord) from the offeynges and
censynge that she has made unto her gods in high places. Wherefore my heart
mourns for Moab, like a croude playing an heavy so^g: and for the men's sake of
the brycke wall my heart mourns also, even as a pype that pypeth a doleful
song: for they shall be very few, and destroyed.

All heads shall be shaven, and all berdes clypped of: all hands bound, and
all loins gyrded about with takcloth. Upon all the house tops and streets of
Moab, there shall be mourning: For I will break Moab like an unprofitable
vessel says the Lord. O how fearfuel is she? O how mourns she? O how does
Moab hang down her head, and is ashamed? Thus shall Moab be a laughinge
stock, and had in derision of all them, that be round about her.

For thus says the Lord: Behold, Deu.xx.viii. ^ Ierem.xlix. d.
the ennemy shall come flyenge as an Egle, and sprede his wings upon Moab.
They shall clyme over the walls, and win the strong holds. Then the mighty
men's hertes in Moab shall be like the heart of a woman traueylyng with child,
Ierem.xlix. d


And Moab shall be made so desolate, that she shall no more be a people,
because Esaye.xxiiii. d
and who so gets out of the pyt, shall be taken in the snare.

For I will bring a year of vysitacyon upon Moab, says the Lord.
Esaias.xxiiii. ^
They that are hable to fly, shall stand under the shadow of Hesebon. For
there shall go a fire out of Hesebon, and a flame from Sion, and shall burn up
that proud people of Moab, both before and behind.

Woe be unto the (O Moab) for thou people of Chamos shall perysh: Yea thy sons
and daughters shall be led away captyue. Yet at the last will I bring Moab
out of captyuyte again, says the Lord. Thus far of the plage of Moab.

Has Israel no children, or is he without an heir? Why has your king then

the time comes (says the Lord) that I will bring a noise of war into
Rabah of the Ammonytes. Lahel shall be desolate, and her cytyes brent up: and
the Israelites shall be Lords over those that had them in possession before,
says the Lord. Hesebon shall mourn, for it shall be roted out of the ground,
says the Lord. The cities of Rabah shall cry out, and gyrde the^ selves with
sackcloth: they shall mourn, and run about the walls: for their king shall
be led away prisoner: yea his priests and princes with him.

Wherefore trustest thou in the water

Behold, I will bring a fear upon the, says the Lord God of hosts, from al
those that be about the: so that ye shall be scatered every man from an other,
and no man shall gather them together again that be fled. But after that, I
will bring the Ammonites also out of captyuyte again.

For I will bring destruction upon Esau, yea and the day of his vysytacion. If

Ierem.xxv. b Ezechiel.ix. b i. Petri.iiii.c.


Thou shalt leave thy fatherless children behind the, and I will keep them

No no: thou shalt neither be quyte nor free, but thou must drink also: For
why, I have sworn by my self (says the Lord) ^ Bozrah shall become a
wilderness, an open shame, a laughinge slocke and cursynge: and her cities

The high stomach and the pride of thy vert have disceyued the because thou
will dwell in the holes of stony rocks, and have the high mountains in
possession. Nevertheless though thy neste were as high as the Egles, yet will I
cast the down, says the Lord. Moreover Idumea shall be a wilderness: who
so goes by it, shall be abashed, and wondre at all her miserable plages. Like
as Sodom, Gene.xix. e
Gomor, and the cities that lay there about, were turned up side down (says
the Lord) so shall no body dwell in Idumea, and no man shall have his habytacion
there, Behold, like as the Lion comes up from the pleasant meadows of Jordan
unto the grene pastures of Etham, so will I drive him, and make him tun
against her. But who is the young man that I will ordeyne thereto? Job.xli. a
Who is like unto me? What is he that will sleyue with me? What shepherd may
stand in my hands?



But how should so worshypfull and glorious a city be forsaken? Hear
therefore: her young men shall fall in the streets, and all her men of war
shall be taken away in that time, say the the Lord of hoostes. I will kindle
a fire in the walls of Damascus, which shall consume the palace of Benhadad.

As for Cedar and the kingdom of Hazor, Esaias. (...)
whom Nabuchodonozor the king of Babylon smote down, the Lord has spoken
thus upon them: Arise, and get you up unto Cedar and destroy the people
toward the east. Their tents and their flocks shall they take away, yea
their hangynges and their vessel. Their camels also shall they carye away
with them. They shall come about them on every side with a fearful cry.

Flee, get you sone away, crepe in to caves, that ye may dwell there: O ye
inhabitauntes of Hazor says the Lord: for Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon
has holden a counsel concerning you and concluded his deuyce against you.
Arise, and get you up against yonder rich and careless people (says the

THe words that the Lord spoke unto the Prophet Jeremy, (...)
concerning Babylon, and the land of the Caldees: preach among the Gentyles,
let your voice be herd, make a token: cry out, keep no silence, but say:
Babylon shall be won, Be! shall be confounded, and Merodach shall be overcome.

Yea their gods shall be brought to shame and their images shall stand in
tear. For out of the North there shall come a people against her, which
shall make her land so waste, that no body shall dwell therein: neither man ne
beast, for they shall flee and depart from thence.

In those days and at that time says the Lord, the children of Israel shall
come, they and ye children of Judah, weping and making haste, and shall seek the
Lord their God. They shall ask the way to Sion, thither shall they turn
their faces, and come and hang upon the, in a covenant that never shall be

because ye were so cheerful and glad, to tread down mine heritage, and
fulfilled your pleasures, as the selves in the grass: and tryumphed over the

Through the, I have scattered the shepeherde and his flock, the husband man,

waste and desolate shalt thou lie for ever more says the Lord.

Set up a token in the land: blow the trompettes among the Heathen, provoke
the nayons against her, call the kingdoms of Ararat, Menni, and Ascanes
against her: nombre out Taphsar against her: bring as great a sort of
horses against her, as if they were greshoppers. Prepare against them the
people of the Meedes, with their kings, princes, and all their chief rulers,
yea and the hole land that is under them.

The land also shall shake and be afraid when the device of the Lord shall
come forth against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon so waste, that no man
shall dwell any more therein. The worthyes of Babylon shall leave the battle,
and keep them selves in strong holds, their strength has failed them,
they shall be like women. Their dwelling places shall be burnt up, their
bars shall be broken. One purseuaunt shall mete an other, yea one post shall
come by an other to bring the king of Babylon tidinges: that his city is taken

This is the charge that Jeremy gave unto Saraiah the son of Neriah, the son of
Maasiah, when he went toward Babylon with Sedechias the king of Judah, in ye
fourth year of his reign. Now this Saraiah was a peaceable prince. Jeremy
wrote in a book all the miserye that should come upon Babylon, yea and al these
sermons that be written against Babylon, and gave Saraiah this charge: When
thou come unto Babylon, se that thou read all these words and say: O Lord
thou art determined to rote out this place, so that neither people nor castle
shall dwell there any more, but to lie waste for ever: and when thou have red
out the book, bind a stone to it, and cast it in the wyddest of Euphrates and
say: Even thus shall Babylon sink, and be thrust down with the burden of
trouble that I will bring upon her: so that she shall never come up again. Thus
far are the preachynges of Ieremye.

He repeteth the taking of Sedechias. Jerusalem is taken of the Caldees.
Sedechias sons are killed before his face, and his eyes put out. The city is
burned. The temple is spoiled and robbed. They that were left in Jerusalem,
are carried to Babylon. King Ioakym is brought forth of preson, and fed like

THE BOOK OF THE PROPHET EZECHIEL.
The time wherein Ezechiel prophesied, and in what place. His ofsprynge and
^ffyce. The vysyon of the four beasts. The vysyon of the wheles. The vysyon of
the throne, and of the image above the throne.

CAPI. I.


And I looked, and behold a stormy wind came out of the North with a great
cloud full of fire, which with his glyster lyghtened al round about. And in the
myddest of the fire it was all clear, and as it were the likeness of four
bestes, which were fasshyoned like a man: saving, that every one had four
faces and four wings.

Their legs were straight, but their fete







When the beasts went forth, stood still, or lift them selves up from the
earth: then the wheles also went, stood still, and were lift up, for the
brethe of life was in the wheles.

About over the hedes of the beasts there

Now when they stood still, and had letten down their wings, if thondred in
the fyrmament that was above their heedes. Above the firmament that was over
their heads, there was the fasshyon of a seat, as it had been made of Saphir.
Upon ye seat there sat one like a man. I beheld him, and he was like a clear
light, as if had been all of fire with in from his loins upward,

And beneth when I looked upon him under

The prophet is send to call again the people from their error.

CAPI. II.
ANd then said he unto me: Stand up upon thy fete (o thou son of man)
Ezech. ^
the spirit came in to me and set me up upon my fete: so that I marked the
thing, yt he said unto me. And he said: Behold, thou son of man: I will
send the to the children of Israel, to those runnagates and obstinate people:
for they have taken part against me, and are run away fro me: both they and
their forefathers unto this day.

(...). d.
unto whom thou shalt say on this manner: This the Lord God him self has
spoken, that whether they be obedye^t or no (for it is a froward household)
they may know yet that there has been a Prophet among them.

(...)
neither be afraid of their words: for they shall rebel against the, and
despise the.

Yea thou shalt dwell among scorpions: but fear not their words, be not
abashed

Se that thou speak my words unto the^, whether they be obedye^t or not, for
they are obstynate. Therefore thou son of man, obey thou all things, that I
say unto the, and be not thou styfnecked, like as they are a styfnecked
household. Open thy mouth and eat that I give the.

(...)
So as I was lokynge up, behold, there was sent unto me an hand, wherein was a
closed book: and the hand opened it before me, and it was written within and
without, full of careful mournynges: alas, and woe.

The Prophet being fed with the word of God with the constaunt boldness
of the sprete, is sent unto the people that were in captyuytye. The punishment
of a curate that shows not the people their sins.

CAPI. III.
(...)
and speak unto the children of Israel. So I opened my mouth, and he gave me
the book for to eat, and said unto me: Thou son of man, thy belly shall
eat, and thy bowels shall be filled with the book, that I give ye. Then did I
eat the book, and it was in my mouth sweter then honey. And he said unto me:
thou son of man, get the soon unto the house of Israel, and show them the
words, that I command the: for I send the not to the people that has a
strange, unknown, (...)
or hard speech, but unto the house of Israel: Not to many nations, which
have diverse speeches and hard languages, whose words thou understand not
Nevertheless, if I sent the to those people they would follow the: But the
house of Israel will not follow the, (...)
for they will not follow me: yea all the house of Israel have styf foreheades
and hard hertes. Behold therefore, I will make thy face prevail against
their faces, and harden thy foreheade against their foreheades: so that thy
foreheade shall be harder th^n an Adama^t or flint stone: (...)
that thou may fear them the less, and be less afraid of them, for they
are a froward household.

He said moreover unto me: thou son Ez.viii. a.x. d


I heard also the noise of the wings of the bestes, that russhed one against
an other yea and the ratlyng of the wheles, that were by them, which russhynge
and noise was very great.

Now when the spirit took me up: and carried me away. I went with an heavy and
a sorrowful mind, but the hand of the Lord comforted me right soon.

And so in the beginning of the month

And when the seven days were expired* the Lord said unto me: Ezec.xxxiii. d
Thou son of man I have made the a watchman unto the house of Israel:
therefore take good head to the words, and give them warning at my
commandment.

If I say unto the, concerning the ungodly Preachers.
that (without doubt) he must dye, and thou gyuest him not warning, ne
speak unto him, that he may turn from his evil way, and so to live: Then
shall the same ungodly man dye in his own unrighteousness: but his blood will I
require of thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou give warning unto the wicked, and
he yet forsake not his ungodliness: then shall he dye in his own wickedness,
but thou have discharged thy soul.

Now if a ryghtous man go from his rightousnesse,

Nevertheless, if thou exhortetest the rightous, that he sin not, and so the
ryghtous do not sin: then shall he live, because he has received thy
warning, and thou haste dyscharged thy soul, And there came the hand of the
Lord upon me: and he said unto me: Stand up, and go into the field, that I
may there talk with the.

So when I had risen up, and gone forth in to the field: Behold, Ezechel.i. ^.
the glory of ye Lord stood there, like as I saw it before, by the water of
Cobar.

Then fell I down upon my face, and the be brought for the, to bind the
withal, so that thou shall not escape out of them. And I will make thy tunge
cleue so to the rofe of thy mouth, that thou shalt be domme, and not be as a
chyder with them: for it is an obstynate household.

But when I speak unto the, then open thy mouth, and say: Thus says ye
Lord God: who so hears, let him hear: who so will not, let him leave: for it
is an obstynate household.

The besiege of the city of Jerusalem is sygnifyed. The long contynuaunce of
the captyuytye of Israel. An hunger is prophesied to come in the captyuytye.

CAPI. IIII.


Moreover, take an iron pan, and set it betwyxte the and the city, instead
of an iron wall. Then set thy face toward it, besiege it, and lay ordinance
against it, to win it. This shall be a token unto the house of Israel.

But thou shalt sleep upon thy left side, and lay the sin of the house of
Israel upon the. Certain days appointed, thou shalt sleep upon that side,
and beat their sins. Nume.xiiii. f


A day for a year, a day (I say) for a year, will I ever lay upon the.
Therefore set now thy face against that besieged Jerusalem and discover thine
arm, that thou may prophecy against it.

Behold, I will lay chains upon the that thou shall not turn the from one
side to an other, till thou haste ended the days of thy siege.

Wherefore, take unto the wheat, barlye,

And the meat that thou eatest, shall have a certain wayght appointed: namely
twenty sycles every day. This appointed meat shall thou eat daily, from the
beginning to the end.

Thou shalt drink also a certain measure of water: Namely, the syxte part
of an Hin shall thou drink daily from the beginning unto the end. Barlye
takes shall thou eat, yet shalt thou first struck them over with man's donge,
that they may se (...). And with that said the Lord: Even thus shall the
children of Israel eat their defiled bred in the myddest of the Gentyles,
among whom I will scattre them.

Then said I: Oh Lord God. Behold,

Whereunto he answered me, and said: Well then, I will grant the to take cowes
donge, for the dong of man, and to struck the breed over withal before them.

And he said unto me: Ez^^ Ez^^^ iiii. ^
Behold thou son of man, I will minysshe all the provision of breed in
Jerusalem, so that they shall wey their breed, and eat it with scarceness. But
as for water, they shall have a very little measure thereof to drink. And when
they have no more breed ne water, one shall be destroyed with an other, and
famysshe away for their wickedness.

The ryddle of the hears, by which is signified the destruction of the

Israel.

Moreover, thus said the Lord God: this (...)
(For ye have not walked i^ my laws, neither have ye kept mine ordinances.)
Therefore thus says the Lord God.

I will also come upon the, for in the myddest of the, will I sytte in
judgment, in the sight of the Heathen, and will handle the of such a facion as
I never did before, and as I never will do from that time forth, and that
because of all thine abhominacions. (...)
For (...) the, fathers shall be feign to eat their own sons, and the
sons their own fathers. Such a court will I keep in the, and the hole
remnaunt will I scattre in to all the wyndes.

Wherefore as truly as I live (says the Lord God) saying thou haste defy^ed
my Sanctuarye with all manner abhominacions, and with all thy shameful
offenses. For this cause will I also destroy the. Mine eye shall not ouerse
the, neither will I spare the.

One third part within the, shall dye of the pestilence and of ho^gre: An other
third part shall be slain down round about the, with the sword: The other
third part that remains will I sca^t^e abroad toward all the wyndes, and
draw out the sword after the^. Thus I will perform my indignacion, and set
my wrath against them and ease my self. So that when I have fulfilled mine
anger against them, they shall know that I am the Lord, which with a
feruente gelousye have spoken it.



Even I the Lord have spoken it, and it shall come to pass, when I shote
among them the perylious darts of hongre, which shall be but death: Yea,
therefore shall I shote them, because I will destroy you. (...)
I will increase hongre, and minysh all the provision of breed among you.

Plages and myserye will I send you / yea and wild beasts also to destroy
you. Pestilence and bloodshedyng shall come upon you, and the sword will I
bring over you. Even I the Lord have said it.

He shows that the people shall be plaged for the sin of Idolatrye. He
prophecyeth the repentance of the remnaunt of the people, and their
delyueraunce. The destruction of the froward is prophesied.

CAPI. VI.
(...).c
and say: Hear the word of the Lord God, o ye mountains of Israel: Thus
has ye Lord God spoken to the mountains, hills, valeys and dales.

Behold, I will bring a sword over you, and destroy your hye places: I
will cast down your aulters, and break down your temples. Your flayne men
will I lay before your gods, and the deed carkases of the children of
Israel will I cast before their images, your bones will I destroy round
about your aulters and dwelling places.

The cities shall be desolate, the hill chapels

Your slain men shall lie among you, that ye may learn to know how that I am
the Lord. Barn.iii. ^.
Those that among you have escaped the sword will I leave among the Geni^les,
for I will scatre you among the nations. And they that escape from you shall
think upon me among the Heathen, where they shall be in captivity.

As for that hoorisshe and unfaithful heart of theirs, wherewith they run away
fro me, I will break it: yea and put out those eyes of theyrs, that commit
fornicacion with these ydolles.

Then shall they be ashamed, and displeased

The Lord said moreover unto me: Smite thine hands together, and stamp with
thy fete, and say: Woe worth all the abhominacio^s and wickednesses of the
house of Israel, for because of them they shall perysh with the sword, with
hongre, and with pestilence. Who so is far of, shall dye of the pestilence:
he that is nigh at hand, shall perysshe with the sword / and the other that be
besieged, shall dye of hongre.

Thus will I satisfye my wrothfull displeasure

The end of all the land of Israel shall suddenly come. The cause of the
destruction thereof. The prophet is commanded to show the sum of the
euylles that are at hand.

CAPI. VII.
THe word of the Lord came unto me the land of Israel: The end comes,
yea verily the end comes upon all the four corners of the earth.

But now shall the end come upon the: for I will send my wrath upon the and
will punysshe the: according to thy ways, and reward the after all thy
abhominacyons. Mine eye shall not ouerse the, Eze.vii. b.ix.c
neither will I spare the, but reward the according to thy ways, and declare
thy abhomynacyons. Then shall ye know that I am the Lord.

Thus says the Lord God: Behold, one myserye and plage shall come after an
other: the end is here. The end (I say) that wayteth for the, is come
alredye, the hour is come against the, that dwell in the land.

Eze.vii. b.ix.c






For the vision shall come so greatly over all that it shall not be hyndred: No
man also with his wickedness shall be hable to save his own life. The
trompettes shall ye blow and make you all redye, but no man shall go to the
batel, for I am wroth with all the hole multitude.

Deuteronomy.xxxii. d.


And such as escape and flee from among them, shall be upon the hills, like
as the doves in the field: every one shall be afraid because of his own
wickedness.

All hands shall be let down, and al knees Esaye.xv. d Iere.xlviii. b
and their heedes bald: their silver shall lie in the streets, and their gold
shall be despised: Sopho.i. d Eccle.v. b Prouer.xi. a.
Yea their silver and gold may not deliver them, in the day of the fearful
wrath of the Lord.

They shall not satisfye their hongry souls, neither fill their empty belyes
therewith: For it is become their own decay through their wickedness: because
they made thereof not only costlye jewels for their pomp and pride, but also
abominable images and ydols. For this cause will I make the^ to be abhorred.

Moreover I will give it in to the hands

The law shall be gone from the priests, and wisdom from the elders. The
king shall mourn, the princes shall be clothed in heaviness, and the hands
of the people in the land shall tremble for fear. I will do unto them after
their own ways, and according to their own iudgemenets will I judge them:
to learn them for to know that I am the Lord.

An apperaunce of the similitude of God. Ezechiel is brought unto Jerusalem in
the sprete. The Lord shows the Prophet the Idolatries of the house of
Israel, and chefely of the prestes.

CAPI. VIII.
IT happened that in the sixte year, the fifte day of the sixte month I sat
in my house

And as I looked up, I saw as it were a likeness of fire from his loins
downward, and and from his loins upward it shyned marvelous clear. This
similitude stretched out an hand, and took me by the heery locks of
Daniel.x^.
and the spirit lift me up betwixt heaven and earth: and God brought me in a
vysyon to Jerusalem, in to the entrye of the inner port that lies toward the
north: there stood an image, with whom he that has all things in his power,
was very wroth.

And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was in the same place: even as I
had seen it before in the field. And he said unto me: Thou son of man. O
lift up thine eyes, and look toward the north. Then lift I up beside the
port northward, there was an altar, made unto the image of prouocacion in the
very entryng in. And he said furthermore unto me: Thou son of man, seist thou
what these do? Seist thou the great abhominacions that the house of Israel
commit in this place which ought not to be done in my Sanctuary? But turn the
about, and thou shalt se yet greater abhominacions. And with yt brought he me
to the court gate: and when I looked:

There stood also before the images three score and ten lords of the counsel of
ye house of Israel: and in the myddest of them stood Iaazaniah the son of
Saphan: And every one of them had a censoure in his hand, and out of the
incense there went a smoke, as it had been a cloud. Then said he unto me:

and was come down to the thressholde of the house, and he called the man that
had the lynnen raiment upon him, and the writers ynckhorne by his side, and the
Lord said unto him: Go thy way through the city of Jerusalem, Exodusxii.c
Apoca.vii. a
and set this mark Thau upon the foreheedes of them that mourn and are sorye
for all the abhominacions that be done therein. And to the other he said that I
might hear: Go ye after him through the city, slay, ouerse none, spare none /
kill and destroy both old men and young maidens, children and wives.

But as for those that have this marcke Thau upon them, se that ye touch them
not / and begin at my Sanctuarye. Ier.xxv. d xlix. b.i. Petri.iiii. ^
Then they began at the elders which were in the temple, for he had said unto
them: when ye have defiled the temple, and filled the court with the slain,
then go your way forth. So they went out, and slew down through the city. Now
when they had done the slaughter, and I yet escaped, I fell down upon my face,
and cried, saying: O Lord, will thou then destroy all the r^sidue of Israel
in thy sore displeasure, that thou have poured upon Jerusalem? Then said he
unto me: the wyckednes of the house of Israel and Judah is very great, so that
the land is full of blood, and the city full of unfaithfulness. For they
say: Tusshe the Lord regargeth not the earth, he sees us not.

Therefore will I upon them, mine eye Job.xxii. d Esaye.xxix.c Eccles.xxiii. d
Ezech.vii. a.
neither will I spare them, but will recompense their wickedness upon their
heedes. And behold, the man that had the lynnen raiment upon him and the
writers ynckhorne by his side, told all the matter how it happened, and
said: Lord, as thou have commanded me, so have I done.

Of the man that took hot burning coals out of the middle of the wheles and
of the Cherubyns, in token of the burning of Jerusalem. A rehersall of the
visyon of the wheles, of the beasts, and of the Cherubyns.

CAPI. X.
ANd as I looked behold in the firmament that was above the Crerubyns
Ezechiel.ix. ^
Then said he that sat therein to him that had the lynen rayme^t upon him:
Crepe in bytwen the wheles that are under the Cherubins, and take thine hand
full of hot coals out from bitwene the Cherubyns, and cast them over the
city. And he crepte in that I might se.

Now the Cherubyns stood upon the right side of the house, when the man went
in, and the cloud filled the innermer court. But the glory of the Lord
removed from the Cherubyns, ii. Para.vii. a
and came upon the thresholde of the house, so that the temple was full of
clouds, and the court was full of the shine of the Lords glory. Yea and the
sound of the Cherubins wings was herd in to the fore court, like as it had been the voice of the almighty God when he speaks.

Now when he had bydden the man that was clothed in lynen, to go and take the
hot coals from the myddest of the wheles, which were under the Cherubyns: he
went and stood beside the wheles. Then the one Cherub reached forth his hand
from under the Cherubins, unto the fire that was between the Cherubyns, and
took thereof, and gave it unto him that had on the lynnen raiment in his
hand: which took it, and went out.



When they went forth, they went all Ezechiel.i. b
their backs, their hands and wings, yea and the wheles also were all full
of eyes round about them all four. And I herd him call the wheles Galgal
(that is) a round boule. Every one of them had four faces: so that the one face
was the face of a Cherub, ye the second of man, the third of a lion, the
fourth of an Egle, and they were lifted up above. This is the beast that I saw
at ye water of Cobar. Now when the Cherubyns, went the wheles went with them,
and when the Cherubyns shoke their wings to lift them selves upward, the
wheles remained not behind, but were with them also. Shortly when they stood,
these stood also: And when they were lift up, the wheles were lift up also
with them, for the spirit of life was in the wheles.

Ezechiel.xi. d xl^ii. a.
and remained upon the Cherubins: And the Cherubins flackred with their wings,
and lift them selves up from the earth: so that I saw when they went, and
the wheles with them. And they stood at the east side of the port that is in
the house of the Lord. So the glory of the Lord was upon them. This is the
beast that I saw under the God of Israel, by the water of Cobar. And I
perceived, that it was the Cherubyns. Every one had four faces, and every
one four wings, and under the wings, as it were men's hands. Now the
figure of their faces was, even as I had seen them, by the water of Cobar, and
so was the countenance of them: Every one in his going went strayghte
forward.

who they were that made the people of Israel to straye. Against these he
prophecyeth, showing them how they shall be dysparpled abroad. The renuynge of
the heart comes of God, otherwise can we not walcke in his commandments.
He threateneth them that lean unto their own counselles.

On this manner have ye spoken (O ye house of Israel) and I know the

your enemies hand, and will condemn you. Ye shall be slain in all the
costs of Israel, I will be avenged of you: to learn you for to know, that I

This city shall nor be your cauldron, neither shall ye be the flesh therein:
but in the costs of Israel will I punysshe you, that ye may know, that I am

in whole commandments, ye have not walked ne kept his laws: but have
done after the customs of the Heathen that lie found about you.

Now when I preached, Pheltiah the son of remnaunt in Israel? And so the word
of the Lord came to me on this manner: thou son of man: thy brethren, thy
kynsfolke, and the hole house of Judah, which dwell at Jerusalem, say: they be
gone far from the Lord, but the land is given us in possession. Therefore
tell them, thus says the Lord God: I will send you far of among the
Gentyles, and scatre you among the nations, and I will halow you but a little in
the lands where ye shall come.

Tell them also thus says the Lord God: I will gather you again out of the

you the land of Israel again: and thither shall ye come. And as for all
impedimentes, and all your abhominacions, I will take them away.

That stony heart will I take out of your body, and give you a ph flesshy heart:
that ye may walk in my commandments, (...)
and keep mine ordinances and do them, that ye may be my people, and I your
God. But look whose her us are disposed to follow their abhominacions, and
wicked lyuynges: those men's deeds will I bring upon their own heedes, says
the Lord God.

After this did the Cherubins lift up their wings, and the wheles went with
them, and the glory of the Lord was upon them. So the glory of the Lord went
up from the myddest of the city, and stood upon the mount of the city toward
the east. But the wind took me by, and in a vision (which came by the spirit
of God) it brought me again in to Caldea among the prisoners. Then the vision
yt I had seen, vanisshed away fro me. So I spoke unto the prisoners all the
words of the Lord which he had showed me.

by which the taking of King Sedechias is signified. An other parable whereby

But I will leave a little nombre of the^ from the sword, hungre, and

But say this unto them: The days are at hand, that every thing which has been prophesied, shall be fulfilled. There shall no vision be in vain, neither
any prophecye fail among the children of Israel: for it is I ye Lord that
speak it: and what so ever I the Lord speak shall be performed, and not be
slack in coming.



The word of the Lord against false prophets, which teach the people the
counselles of their own hertes.

CAPI. XIII.
False prophets.
Woe be unto those folysshe Prophets that follow their own spirit, and speak
where they se nothing. O Israel, thy Prophets are like the foxes upon the
dry field: For they stand not in the gappes, neither make they an hedge for
the house of Israel, that men might abide the peril in the day of the Lord.
Vain things they se: and tell lies to maynteyne their preachynges withal.
The Lord (say they) has spoken it, when in very deed the Lord has not
sent them. Vain visions have ye seen, and spoken false prophecyes, when ye
say: the Lord has spoken it, where as I never said it.


Behold, I will upon you, says the Lord. Mine hands shall come upon the
Prophets that look out vain things, and preach lies: they shall not be in
the counsel of my people, nor written in the book of the house of Israel,
neither shall they come in the land of Israel: that ye may know, how that I
am the Lord God. And that for this cause: Ierem.viii. b
they have disceyued my people, and told them of peax, where no peax was. One
sets up a wall, and they dawbe it with loose claye. Therefore tell them
which dawbe it with untempered mortar, Math.vii.c.
that it shall fall. For there shall come a great shower of rain, great stones
shall fall upon it, and a sore storm of wind shall break it, so shall the wall
come down.

Shall it not then be said unto you: where is now the mortar, that ye dawbed it
withal? Therefore thus says the Lord God: I will break out in my wrothfull
displeasure with a stormye wind, so that in mine anger, there shall come a
mighty shower of of rain and haylestones in my wrath, to destroy withal.

As for the wall that ye have dawbed with

Thus will I perform my wrath upon this wall, and upon them that have dawbed
it with untempered mortar, and then will I say unto you: The wall is gone, and
the dawbers are away. These are the Prophets of Israel, which prophecye unto
the city of Jerusalem, and look out visyons of peax for them, where as no
peax is, says the Lord God.

Wherefore (O thou son of man) set thy face against the daughters of thy
people, which prophecye out of their own hertes: and speak thou prophecye
against them, and say: Thus says the Lord God: Woe be unto you yt sow
pyllowes under all arm holes, and bolsters under the heedes both of young and
old, to catch souls withal. For when ye have gotten the souls of my people
in your captivity, ye promise them Esaye. ^ Mich. ^
for an handful of barlye, and for a piece of breed: when ye kill the souls of
them, that dye not, and promise life to them that live not: thus ye dissemble
with my people that byleueth your lies.

Wherefore thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will also upon the pillowes,
wherewith ye catch the souls in fleing: them will I take from your arms, and
let yt souls go, that ye catch in fleing.

Your bolsters also will I tear in pieces, and deliver my people out of your
hand: so that they shall come no more in your hands to be spoyley, and ye
shall know that I am the Lord.

Saying that with your lies ye discomforte the heart of the ryghtous whom I
have not discomforted. Again: For so much as ye courage the hand of the
wicked, Ose.iiii* ^
so that he may not turn from his wicked way and live: therefore shall ye
spy out no more vanity, nor prophecye your own gessynges: for I will
deliver my people out of your hand, that ye may know how that I am the
Lord.

The Lord denies his word to the people for their sins sake. The dyspysers
of the word does the Lord sometime deceive by false prophets. A comfort of
them that tledde unto Babylon.

son of man, these men beat their Idolles in their hertes, and go purposly
upon the stomblynge block of their own wickedness: how dare they the^ ask
counsel at me? Therefore speak unto them, and say: thus says the Lord God:
Every man of ye house of Israel that bears his Idolles in his heart,
purposinge to stomble in his own wickedness, and comes to a prophet, to
inquire any thing at me by him: unto that man will I the Lord my self give
answer, according to the multitude of his Idolles. that the house of Israel
may be snared in their own hertes, because they be clean gone fro me, for
their Idolles sakes.

Or if I bring a swearde into the land, and charge it to go through the land:
so that I stay down man and beast in it, and if these three men were therein:
As truly as I live (says the Lord God) they shall deliver neither sons ne
daughters, but only be saved them selves. If I send a pestylence into the
land, and pour out my sore indignacio^ upon it in blood, so that I rote out
of it both man and beast, and if Noe, Danyel, and Job, were therein: as truly as
I live (says the Lord God) they shall deliver neither sons ne daughters,
but save their own souls in their rightousnesse. Moreover thus says the
Iere.xxvii. b
Though I send my four troublous plages upon Jerusalem: the swearde honger,
perelous beasts and pestylence, to destroy man and beast out of it: yet
shall there be a remnau^t saved therein, which shall bring forth their sons
and daughters. Behold they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall se their
way, and what they take in hand, and ye shall be comforted, as touching all
the plages that I have brought upon Jerusalem.

They shall comfort you, when ye se their way and works: and ye shall know,
how that it is not without a cause, that I have done so against Jerusalem, as
I did, says the Lord God.

As the unprofitable wodde of the vine tree is cast in to the fire, so (says
he) that Jerusalem shall be brent.

THe word of the Lord came unto me,

Seeing then, that it was mete for no work

The prophet intending to speak of the abhominacyons of Jerusalem: does
first show the benefytes of God toward it. Jerusalem is reproved of
unkindness, for her fornication with Idolles. He iustifyeth the wickedness of
other people in comparison of the sins of Jerusalem. The cause of the
abhominacyons in to which the Sodomytes fell. Mercy is promised ^o the
repentaunt. CAPI, XVI.


Then came I by the, and saw the trodden down in thine own blood, and said
unto the: thou shalt be purged from thine own blood, from thine own blood
(I say) shall thou be cleansed. So I planted the, as the blossom of thy field:
thou art grown up, and waxen great: thou have gotten a marvelous pleasant
beautye, thy breasts are come up, thy hear is goodly grown, where as thou
wast naked and bare before.



Thou did eat nothing but ^ymnels, honye and oil: marvelous goodly wast
you and beautyfull, yea even a very Queen wast thou. In so much, that thy beauty
was spoken of among the heithen, for thou wast excellent in my beauty, which I
put upon the says the Lord God.

But thou haste put confydence in thine own beauty, and played the harlot,
when thou had gotten the a name. Thou haste committed boredome, with all
that went by the, and have fulfilled their desires: yea thou haste taken thy
garments of diverse colors, and deckte thine aulters therewith, whereupon thou
myghtest fulfill thine boredome, of such a fashyon, as never was done ne shall
be. The goodly ornaments and Jewels

Thy garments of diverse colors have thou taken, and deckte them therewith
mine oil and incense have thou set before them.

My meat which I gave the, as symnels, oil, and honey (to feed the withal)
that have thou set before them, for a sweet sauoure. And this came also to
pass, says the Lord God: Thou haste taken thine own sons and daughters,
whom thou had begotten unto me: and these haste thou offered up unto the^,
to be their meat. Is this but a small boredome of thine (think thou) that
thou slayest my children, and gyuest them over, to be brent unto them? And yet
in all thy abhomynacions and boredome, thou have not remembered the days of thy
youth, how naked and bare thou wast at that time, and trodden down in thine
own blood. After all these thy wickedness^s (woe woe unto the, says the Lord)
thou haste builded thy slewes and brodel houses in every place: yea at the heed
of every street have thou builded the an altar. Thou haste made thy beauty to
be abhorred, thou haste laid out thy legs to every one that came by, and
multyplyed thine boredome. Thou have committed fornycacion with

Behold, I will stretch out mine hand over the, and will mynysshe thy store of
sode and deliver the over into the wylles of the Philistines thine enemies,
which are ashamed of thy abhomynable way. Thou haste played the bore also with
the Assyria^s, which might not satisfy the: Yea thou haste played the
harlot, and not had enough. Thus have thou still committed thy fornycacion
from the land of Canaan unto the Caldees, and yet thy lust not satisfied.
How should I circumcyse thine heart (says the Lord God) saying thou do all
these things, thou precious hoore: building thy stews at the head of every
street, and thy brodell houses in all places?

Thou have not ben as an other hoore, that makes boste of her winning, but as
a wife that breaks wedlock, and takes other instead of her husband.
Gifts are given to all other hoores, but thou gyuest rewards unto all thy
lovers, and offrest them gifts, to come unto the out of all places, and to
commyt fornicacion with the. It is come to pass with the in thy booredomes
contrary to the use of other women: yea there has no such fornicacion ben
committed after the, saying that thou proferest gifts unto other, and reward
is given the: this is a contrary thing.

Therefore hear the word of the Lord, O thou harlot, thus says the Lord
God. For so much as thou have spente thy money, and discovered thy shame,
through thy boredome with all thy lovers, and with all the ydols of thy
abhominacions in the blood of thy children, whom thou have given them:
Behold therefore I will gather together all thy lovers, unto whom thou have
made thy self common: yea, and all them whom thou fauourest, and every one
that thou hate: and will discover thy shame before the^, (...).xvi.c
(...).xxxiii. b
that they all may se thy fylthynesse.

Moreover, I will judge the as a breaker (...).xxv. a
I will give the over into their power, that shall break down thy stews, and
destroy thy brodell houses: they shall stryp the out of thy clothes, all thy
fair and beautyfull Jewels shall they take from the, (...).xx. b (...).xxv. b
and so let the sit naked and bare: yea they shall bring the common people upon
ye, which shall stone the, and slaye the down with their swerdes. They shall
burn up thy houses, and punysh the in the sight of many women. Thus will I make
thy horedome to cease, so that thou shalt give out no more rewards.

Should I make my wrath to be still, take my gelousye from the, be content,
and no more to be displeased? saying thou remembrest not the days of thy
youth, but have provoked me to wrath in all these things? Behold therefore, I
will bring thine own ways upon thine head, says the Lord God: how be it, I
never did unto the, according to thy wickedness and al thy abhomynacyons.
Behold, all they that use common proverbs, shall use this proverb also
against the: such a mother, such a daughter.

Thou art even thy mothers own daughter, that has cast of her husband and
her children. Yea thou art the sister of thy sisters, which forsook their
husbands and their children. (...) xvi. ^
Your mother is a Cethite, and your father an Amoryte. Thine eldest sister is
Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell upon thy left hand.

(...)
Sodoma thy sister with her daughters, has not done so evil, as you and thy
daughters. (...).
Behold, the sins of thy sister Sodoma were these: Pride, fulness of meat,
abou^daunce and Idelnes: these things had she and her daughters. Besides that,
they reached not their hand to the poor and nedy, but were proud, and did
abhomynable things before me: (...)
therefore them I took away, when I had seen it. Neither has Samaria done half
of thy sins, yea thou haste exceaded them in wyckednes: In so much that in
comparyson of all the abhomynacions which thou have done, thou haste made thy
systers good women.

As for their captyuytye, namely the captyuytye of Sodoma and her daughters:
the captyuytye of Samaria and her daughters: I will bring them again, so will
I also bring again thy captyuytye among the^: that thou may take thine
own confusyo^ upon the, and be ashamed of all that thou have done, and to
comfort them. Thus thy sisters (namely) Sodoma and her daughters, Samaria and
her daughters, with thy self and thy daughters, shall be brought again to
your old estate.

When thou wast in thy pride, and before

For thus says the Lord God: I should (by right) deal with the, as thou
have done. Thou have despised the oath, and broken the couenaunte.
Nevertheless, I will remember the couenaunte that I made with the in thy
youth, in so much that it shall be an everlasting covenant: so that thou
also remember thy ways, and be ashamed of them: the^ shall thou receive of me
thy elder and younger systers whom I will make thy daughters, Iere.xxxi.c
Hebre.viii. b
and that beside thy covenant. And so I will renew my covenant with the, that
thou may know that I am the Lord: that thou may think upon it, be
ashamed, and excuse thine own confusyon no more: when I have forgyuen the, all
that thou haste done, says the Lord God.

And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I entreat you after my name, not
after your wicked ways, ne according to your corrupt works: O ye house of
Israel, says the Lord.

Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying: Thou son of man,
set thy face toward the Southe, and speak to the Southe wind, and say to
the wodde toward the Southe: Hear the word of the Lord, thus says the
Lord God: Behold, I will kyndle a fire in the, that shall consume the grene
trees with the dry. No man shall be hable to quench his flame, but all that
looks from the South to the North shall be burnt therein: and all flesh
shall se that I the Lord have kyndled it, so that no man may quench it. Then
said I: O Lord, they will say of me: Tusshe, they are but fables that he
tells.

He threateneth the sword, that is to say, destruction to the city of
Jerusalem. He shows the fall of king Sedechias. He is commanded to prophecy
the destruction of the children of Ammon. After the slaughter of other, at the
last the Lord threateneth death unto Nabuchodonozor him self.

CAPI. XXI.
THe word of the Lord came to me,

Mourn therefore (O thou son of man) that thy loins crack withal / yea
mourn

Again, the word of the Lord came

Cry (O thou son of man) and bowl, for this sword shall smite my people, and
all the

The word of the Lord came yet unto me again, saying: Thou son of man,
make the two streets, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come. Both
these streets shall goo out of one land. He shall set him up a place, at the
head of the street shall he chose him out a corner. Make the a street, that
the sword may come toward Kabath of the Ammonites, and to the strong city
of Jerusalem.

Leuit.xix. f xx. a Leut.xviii b
at the heed of the two streets to ask counsel at the sothesayers, casting
the lottes with his arowes to ask counsel at the ydolles, and to look in the
liver.

But the sothesayinge shall point to the right side upon Jerusalem, that he
may set men of war to smite it, with a great noise to cry out alarm, to
set battelltammes against the gates, to grave up ditches, and to make bulworkes.

Nevertheless, as for the sothesayenge, they shall hold it but for vanity,
even as though a jest were told them: yea, and they them selves remember their
wickedness, so that by right they must be taken and won. Therefore says
the Lord God:

O thou shameful wicked guide of Israel whose day is come / even the time that
wickedness shall have an end. Thus says the Lord God: take away the
myrre, and put of the crown, and so is it away: the humble is exalted, and the
proud brought low. Punysshe, punysshe / yea puny^she them will I, and destroy
them: and that shall not be fulfilled until he come, to whom the judgment
belongs, and to whom I have given it.

And thou (O son of man) prophecye and Iere.xlix.c. Ezechie.xxi. a Amos.i.c.
and to their blasphemye speak thou: The the sword, the sword is drawn
forth alredye to the slaughter, and scoured that it glystereth (because thou
have looked the out vanities, and prophesied lies) that it may come upon thy
neck, like as upon the other ungodly, which be slain: whose day came, when
their wickedness was full.

Though it were put up again in to the sheathe / yet will I punysshe the in
the land where thou wast nourysshed and borne, and power my indignacyon upon
the, and will blow upon the in the fire of my wrath, and deliver the unto
cruel people, which are learned to destroy. Thou shalt feed the fire, and
thy blood shall be shed in the land, that thou may be put out of
remembrance. Even I the Lord have spoken it.

The word of the Lord against Jerusalem for manslaughter, and denyinge due
honor to their fathers and mothers, and other wyckednesses. Of the wicked
doctrine of the false prophets and prestes, and of their vnlacyable
covetousness. The Tyranye of rulers. The unkindness of the people.

CAPI. XXII.
Moreover the word of the Lord came

Thou have caused thy days to draw nigh, Da^^ xxv.c.
the rulers of Israel have brought every man his power, to shed blood in the.
In the have they despised father and mother, in the have they oppressed the
stranger, in the have they vexed the wydowe and the fatherless. Thou have
despised my Sanctuarye, and unhallowed my Saboth. Deuteronomy* ^ Leu^^. ^
Murderers are there in the, that shede blood, and eat up the hills, and in
the they use unhappiness.

In the have they discovered their fathers Ier^^
In the has every man forced his own sister, eue^ his fathers daughter: yea
gifts have been received in ye to shede blood. Thou have taken vsurye and
encreace, thou have oppressed thy neighbors by extorcion, and forgotten me,
says the Lord God.

Behold, I have smytten my hands upon

And the word of the Lord came unto me

Like as the silver is melted in the fire, so shall ye also be melted therein:
that ye may know how that I the Lord have poured my wrath upon you.



They receive richesse and good, and make many wydowes in the. Thy priests
break my law, and defyle my Sanctuary. They put no difference bitwene ye holy
and unholy, neither discern bitwene the clean and unclean: they turn their
eyes fro my Sabothes, and I am unhallowed among them. (...)
Thy rulers in the are like rauysshynge wolves to shede blood, and to destroy
souls for their own covetous

And I sought in the land for a man that would make up the hedge, and ^et him
self in the gap before me, in the lands behalf, that I should not utterly
destroy it, but I could lynde none. Therefore will I pour out my cruel
displeasure upon them, and burn them in the fire of my wrath: their own ways
will I recompense upon their heads, says the Lord God.

Of the fornicacyon, meaning the Idolatry of Samaria and Jerusalem: under the
names of Oholah and Oholibah. In comparison of Samaria he shows that the
fornicacyon of Jerusalem is the fylthyer. The destruction of Jerusalem is
prophesied. The aduoutrye of both the hores is found out. Their destruction.

CAPI. XXIII.
THe word of the Lord came unto me,

Thus through her hooredome, she cleued unto all the young men of Assiria: Yea,
she Ezechi.xvi. ^
These discovered her shame, took her sons and daughters, and slew her with
the sword. An evil name gat she of all people, and they punisshed her.

Her sister Oholibah saw this, and destroyed her self with inordinate love,
more then she, and exceded her sister in hoordome, she loved the Assirians
(which also lay with her) namely the princes and great lords, that were
clothed with all manner of gorgyous apparel, all lusty horsemen, and fair young
persons. Then I saw that they both were defiled alyke.

But she increased still in hooredome: for

Now when the Babylonians came to her they lay with her, and defiled her with
their hooredome, and so was she polluted with them. Esaye.xlvii. ^ Naum.iii. d
Ezechi.xvi.c
And when her lust was abated from them, her hooredome and shame was
discovered and seen, then my heart forsook her, like as my heart was gone from
her sister also.

Nevertheless, she used her hoordome ever the longer the more, and remembered
the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt /
she brent in lust upon them, whose flesh was like the flesh of Asses, and their
seed like the seed of horses. Thus thou have renewed the filthiness of thy
youth, when thy lovers brosed thy pappes, and marred thy breasts in Egypt.

Therefore (O Oholibah) thus says the

They shall cut of thy nose and thine ears, and the remnaunt shall fall through
the sword. They shall carye away thy sons and daughters, and the residue
shall be brent ^^^he fire. They shall strype the out of thy clothe^s, and
carye thy costly iewelles away with them.



Thus says the Lord God: Thou shalt drink of thy systers cup, how deep
and far so ever it be to the botome. Thou shall be laughed to scorn, and
had as greatly in derysyon, as is possible. Thou shalt be ^ull of
drunkenness and sorrow, for the cup of thy sister Samaria, is a cup of
destruc^ion and wasting: the same shalt thou drink and suppe it out, even
to the dregs: yea thou shalt eat up the broken pieces of it, and so tear
thine own breasts: For even I have spoken it says the Lord God.



The Lord said moreover unto me: thou son of man, will thou not reprove
Oholah, and Oholibah? Show them their abhominacions: namely that they have
broken their wedlock, and stained their hands with blood: yea even with
their ydols have they committed aduoutrye, and offered them their own children
(to be devoured) whom they had borne unto me. iiii. Reg.xxi. a


Ezech.xvi.c.
Yea, and this have they done unto me also: they have defiled my Sanctuarye, in
that same day, and have unhallowed my Sabbath. For when they had slain these
children for their ydolles, they came the same day in to my Sanctuary to
defyle it. Lo, this have they done in my house.

Beside all this, thou haste sent thy messengers for men out of far
countries: and when they came, thou haste bathed, trymmed and set forth thy
self of the best facion: Exodusxx. d.
thou sattest upon a goodly bed, and a table spread before the, whereupon thou
have set mine incense and mine oil.



O ye all that love virtue and rightousnes judge them, and punysshe them: Leuit
xx. ^ Ezechi. ^^
as aduoutrers and murderers ought to be judged and punysshed. For they are
breakers of wedlock and the blood is in their hands. Wherefore thus says
the Lord God: Bring a a great multitude of people upon them, and make them
be scattered and spoiled: these shall stone them, and gore them with their
swerdes. They shall slay their sons and daughters, and burn up their houses
with fire.

Thus will I destroy all such fylthynesse out of the land, that all women
may learn, not to do after your uncleanness. And so they shall lay your
fylthynesse upon your own selves, and ye shall be punysshed for the sins
that ye have committed with your ydolles / and ye shall know that I am the
Lord.

He proves the fyrynge of Jerusalem by a parable of a seething pot. The
parable of Ezechiels wife being dead, which he after expounds.

CAPI. XXIIII.
IN the nineth year, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, came
the word E^echi.xvi. ^ Eze^h^.x* ^
Show that stubborn houshoulde a parable, and speak unto them. Thus says
the Lord God. Get the a pot, set it on, and pour water in to it / put all the
pieces togy-in it, all the good pieces / the loyne and the shoulder, and fill it
with the best bones. Take one of the best sheep, and an heap of bones with all
/ let it boil well, and let the bones sethe well therein.

With that said the Lord God on this (...)
Woe be unto the bloody city of the pot, whereupon the rustynesse hangs, and
is not yet scoured away. Take out the pieces that are in it, one after an
other / there need no lottes be cast therefore, for the blood is yet in it.
Upon a plain dry stone has she poured it, and not upon the ground, that it
might be covered with duste. And therefore have I letten her pour her blood
upon a plain dry stonye rock, (...).
because it should not be hid, and that I might bring my wrothful
indignacion and vengeance upon her.

Wherefore, thus says the Lord God: bear thou the boones together, kyndle
thou the fire, sethe the flesh, let all be well sodden, that the bones may
be suckte out. Moreover set the pot emptye upon the coals, that it may be
warm, and the metal hot, that the fylthe and rustynesse may be consumed.



(...), thy (...).
yet shalt thou neither mourn nor weep, ne water thy chekes therefore: you
may mourn by thy self alone: but use no deedly lamentacion. Hold on thy
bonet, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, cover not thy face, and eat no
mourners breed.

So I spoke unto the people bitymes in the morning, and at even my wife dyed:
then upon the next morrow I did as I was commanded. And the people said unto
me: will thou not tell us what that signifies which thou do?



Like as I have done, so shall ye do also: Ye shall not hyde your faces, ye
shall eat no mourners breed: your bonnettes shall ye have upon your heedes,
and shoes upon your fete.



But behold, O thou son of man: In the day when I take from them their
power, their joy and honor, the lust of their eyes, the burden of their
bodies: namely their sons and daughters. Then shall there one escape, and
come unto the / for to show the. In that day shall thy mouth be opened to
him which is escaped, that thou may speak, and be no more domme: yea, and
thou shalt be their show token, that they may know how that I am the Lord.

The word of the Lord upon the sons of Ammon, which rejoiced at the fall
of Jerusalem. Against Moab and Seir. Against Idumea. Against the Philistynes.

CAPI. XXV.
THe word of the Lord came unto me, saying: thou son of man, set thy face
Ezecki.xvi. d Iere.xlix. a.
Prophecye upon them, and say unto the Ammonites: hear the word of the Lord
God. Thus says the Lord God. For so much as thou speak over my
Sanctuarye. A ha, I trow it be now suspended: and over the land of Israel /
I trow it be now desolate, yea and over the house of Judah, I trow they be
now led away prisoners. Behold, I will deliver the to the people of the
East, that they may have the in possession: these shall set their castles
and houses in the. They shall eat thy fruit, and drink up thy milk. As for
Rabath, I will make of it a stall for camelles, and of Ammon a sheep fold: and
ye shall know, that I am the Lord.

For thus says the Lord God: In so

Thus says the Lord God: Esaias.xv.xv^. Esaias.xlv.ii. a Sophon.ii. b.
For so much as Moab and Seir do say: As for the house of Judah, it is but
like as all other Gentiles be. Therefore bebolde, I will make the cities of Moab
weaponlesse, and shall take away their strength: their cities and chief
costs of their land, which are the pleasures of the country: As namely
Bethiesimoth, Baalmeon, and Cariathaim: these will I open unto them of the
East, that they may fall upon the Ammonites: and will give it them in
possession / so that the Ammonites shall no more be had in remembrance among
the Heathen. Even thus will I punysshe Moab also, that they may know how that
I am the Lord.

Moreover, thus says the Lord God: Esaias.xxxiiii. a Ierem.xlix. b
Ezech.xxxii. f xxxv. a. Ps.cxx^vii. b. Gene.xxv. d.
Because that Edom has avenged and eased him self upon the house of Judah /
therefore thus says the Lord: I will reach out mine hand upon Edom, and take
away man and beast out of it.

From Theman unto Dedan will I make it desolate / they shall be slain with ye
sword. Through my people of Israel will I avenge me again upon Edom: i.
Macha.v. a
they shall handle him according to my wrath and indignacion, so yt they shall
know my vengeance, says the Lord God.

Thus says the Lord God: For so much taken vengeance with despytefull
stomachs, Es^ye. ^iiii.c Iere. ^lvii. a Sophoni.ii. a
and of an old evil will set them selves to destroy. Therefore thus says
the Lord God: Behold, I will stretche out mine hand over the Philistines,
and destroy the destroyer, and cause all the remnaunt of the sea cost to
perysshe. A great vengeance will I take upon them, and punysshe them
cruellye: that they may know how that I am the Lord, which have avenged me
of them.

He prophecyeth that Tyrus shall be overthrown, because it re^oyced at the
destruction of Jerusalem. The wonderynge and astonyshment of the marchantes,

Esaye.xxiii. a Iere.xlvii. b Ezechi.xxvii.
A ha, now I trow the ports of the people be broken, and she turn^d unto me,
for I have destroyed my belly full.

Yea, therefore says the Lord God: Behold, O Tire, I will upon the, I will
bring a great multitude of people against the, like as when the sea aryseth
with his waves: These shall break the walls of Tire, and cast down her
towers: I will scrape the ground trome her, and make her a bare stone: yea as
the dryinge place where the fisshers hang up the net^es by the sea side. Even
I have spoken it, says the Lord God. The Gentiles shall spoil her / her
daughters upon the field, shall perysshe with the sword, that they may know
how that I am the Lord.



He shall slay thy people with the sword, and Ieremi.vii. d
Thy stones, thy tymbre and foundacions shall they cast in the water. Thus
will I bring the melodye of thy songs, and the voice of thy mynstrelsye to an
end, so that they shall no more be herd. I will make a bare stone of the /
yea a dryinge place for nets, and shalt never be builded again: For even I
the Lord have spoken it, says the Lord God: thus has the Lord God spoken
concerning Tire. The Isles shall be moved at the noise of thy fall, and at the
cry of the slain that shall be murdered in the. All kings of the sea shall
come down from their seats regal: they shall lay away their robes, and put
of their costly clothing: Yea with trembling shall they be clothed, they shall
sit upon the ground: they shall be afraid at thy sodeyn fall, and be abashed
at the.

They shall mourn for the, and say unto the: O thou noble city that have ben
so greatly (...).
thou that haste ben the strongest upon the sea with thine inhabitau^tes, of
whom all men stood in fear: how art thou now so utterly destroyed? Now at the
time of thy fall the inhabitauntes of the yles / yea and the yles them selves
shall stand in fear at thine end.

For thus says the Lord God: when I make the a desolate city (as other
cities be, that no man dwell in) and when I bring the deep upon the, that
great waters may cover the: Then will I cast the down unto them that
descend in to the pytte: unto a people that has been long deed, and set the
in a land that is been the, like the old wilderness, with them which go
down to their graves, so that no man shall dwell more in the. And I will make
the to be no more in honor in the land of the living. I will make an end
of the, and thou shall be gone. Though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou not
be found for evermore, says the Lord God.

taken Cedre trees to make the masles: and the oaks of Basan to make the rowers.

Thy bardes have they made of yuery, and

They of Sidon and Arnad were thy maryners, and the wisest in Tire were thy
shipmasters. The eldest and wysest at Gebal were they, that mended and stopped
thy ships. All ships of the sea with their shypmen occupied their
marchau^dyes in the. The Perses, Libians, and Lidia^s, were in thine host, and
helped ye to fight: these hanged up their shield and helmettes with the, these
set forth thy beautye. They of Arnad were with thine host round about thy
walls, and were thy watchmen upon thy towers, these hanged

cloth, with sylcke and with Crystal.







The suburbs shall shake at the loud cry of thy shypmen. All whirry men, and
all maryners upon the sea, shall leap once of their boots, and set them
selves upon the land. They shall lift up their voice because of yt, and make
a lamentable cry. They shall cast dust upon their heads, and lie down in the
ashes. They shall shave them selves, and put sack cloth upon them for thy sake.

They shall mourn for the with hertfull

But thou art now cast down into the deep of the sea, all thy resort of
people is perisshed with the. All they that dwell in the Isles are abashed at

The merchants of the nations wondre at the. In that thou art so clean
brought to naught, and co^mest no more up.

The word of God against the king of Tyrus for his pride. Daniel. The

THe word of the Lord came unto me, saying: Thou son of man, tell the
Ezehie.xxvi.xxvii.
because thou haste a proud heart and haste said: I am a God, I have my seat

Esaye.xiiii. a

thy self wyser then Daniel, Daniel.ii.
that there is no secrets hyd from the

With thy wisdom and thy understanding, thou have gotten the great welthines
and gathered treasure of silver and gold: With thy great wisdom and
occupyenge haste thou increased thy power, and because of thy great riches,
thy heart is proud.

Therefore thus says the Lord God: For so much as thou have lift up chine
heart, as though thou were God behold, I will bring enemies upon the, even the
tyrauntes of ye Heithen: these shall draw out their sweardes upon thy beautye
and wisdom, and shall defyle thy glory.

They shall cast the down to the pytte, so that thou shalt dye in the myddest
of the sea as they that be slain.

Let se, if thou will say then (before them that slaye the) I am God: where as
thou art but a man and not God, in the hands of them that slaye the.

Dye shall thou, even as the vncircumcysed in the hands of the enemies: for I
my self have spoken it: says the Lord God.

Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me saying: Thou son of man, make
a lamentable complaynte over the king of Tire, and tell him: Thus says the
Lord God: Thou art a seal of a likeness, full of wisdom and excellent
beautye. Thou have been in the pleasant garden of God: thou are dccr with all
manner of precious stones: with Ruby, Topas, Crystal, Iacyncre, Onix, Iaspis,
Saphir, Smaragde, Carbuncle, and gold. Thy beautye and the holes that be in
the were set forth in the day of thy creacion. Thou art a fair Cherub,
stretched wide out for to cover.

Esaye.ii. d.
thy heart is full of wyckednes, and thou have offended. Therefore will I cast
the from the mount of God (O thou coueryng Cherub) and destroy the among the
glysterynge stones. Thy heart was proud in thy fair beautye, and through thy
beauty thou have destroyed thy wisdom, I will cast the down to the ground,
and that in the sight of kings.



And the word of the Lord came unto

Prophecye upon it, and speak. Thus says the Lord God: Io^el.iiii. a

Behold O Sidon, I will upon the, and get me honor in the: that it may be

For I will send pestylence and blood sheddyng into her streates, so that
those which be slain with the swearde, shall lie round about in the myddest

prickinge thorn, and an hurtynge breer unto the house of Israel, ne unto them
that lie round about her and hate her: and they shall know, that I am the

Thus says the Lord God: when I gather

He prophecyeth against Pharao. He prophecieth the desolation of Egypt, and the

CAPI. XXIX.
IN the tenth year upon the twelueth day of the tenth month, the word of the
Lord Esaias.x^xx. a. Iere^ (...) Ezechi. ^xxxi.xx^^
O thou son of man, set now thy face against Pharao the king of Egypt,
prophecye against him, and against the hole land of Egypt: Speak and tell
him, thus says the Lord God: behold, O Pharao thou king of Egypt, I will

water is mine. I have made it my self. I will put an hook in thy chawes, and
hang all the fysshe in thy waters upon thy skales: after that I will draw the
out of thy waters: Yea and all the fysshe of thy wateres that hang upon thy
skales. I will cast the out upon the dry land with the fysshe of thy waters,
so that thou shalt lie upon the field. Thou shalt not be gathered ne taken
up: but shall be meat for the beasts of the field, and for the souls of the
air: that all they which dwell in Egypt, may know, that I am the Lord:
because thou have been a staf of read to the house of Israel. When they took

and if they leaned upon the, thou brakest and hurtest the reins of their
backs. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: behold. I will bring a swearde
upon the, and rote out of the both man and beast. Yea the land of Egypt shall
be desolate and waste, and they shall know, that I am the Lord: Because he
said: ye watee is mine, I my self have made it: Behold therefore, I will upon
the, and upon thy waters: I will make the land of Egypt waste and desolate,
from the tower of Syenes, unto the borders of the Morians land so that in.xl.
years there shall no foot of man walk there, neither foot of cattle go^ there,
neither shall it be inhabyted. I will make the land of Egypt to be desolate,
among other waste countries, and her cities to lie void.xl. years, among
other void cities: And I will scatre the Egypcians among the heithen and
nations.

Again, thus says the Lord God: When the.xl. years are expired, I will
gather the Iere^* ^
out of the nations, among whom they were scatered, and will bring the
prisoners of Egypt again into the land of Pathures their own natyue
country, that they may be there a lowly small kingome: yea they shall be the
smallest among other kingdoms leest they exalte them selves above the
Heithen: for I will so menisshe them that they shall no more rule the Heithen.

They shall no more be an hope unto the house of Israel, neither provoke them
any more to wickedness, to cause the^ turn back and to follow them: and they
shall know that I am the Lord God.



Therefore thus says the Lord God: behold I will give the land of Egypt
unto Nabuchonozor the king of Babylon* that he may take away all her
substance, rob her robberyes, and spoil her spoils, to pay his host their
wages withal. I will give him the la^d of Egypt for his labor, that he took for
me before Tire.

At the same time will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to grow
forth, and open thy mouth again among them: that they may know, how that I
am the Lord.

The destruction of Egypt and of his cytyes is bewailed.

CAPI. XXX.

thus says the Lord God: Mourn, woe worth this day, for the day is here,
the day of the Lord is come: the darcke day of the Heithen, the hour is at

When ye wounded me^ fall down in Egypt, when her people are taken away, and
when her foundacions are destroyed, the Morians la^d shall be afraid, yea the
morians land, Libia and Lidia, all their common people, and Chub, all that be
confederate unto them, shall fall with them through the swearde.



At that time, shall their messengers goo forth fro me in ships, to make the
careless Morians afraid, and sorrow shall come upon them in the day of Egypt
for doubtless it

Thus says the Lord God: I will make an end of the people of Egypt through the
hand of Nabuchodonosor king of Babilo^. Stand his people with him, yea and the
cruel tyrauntes of the Heithen shall be brought to destroy the land.

They shall draw out their sweardes upon Egypt and fill the land full of
slain me^ I will dry up their floudes of water, and sell the land into the
hands of wicked people. The land and all that is therein, will I destroy
through the enemies. Even I the Lord have said it.

And thus says the Lord God: I will zachar.xiii. ^
and bring the images of Noph to an end. There shall no more be a prince of
Egypt, and a fearfulness will I send in to ye Egipcians land. As for
Pathures. I will make it desolate, and kyndle a fire in Zoan. Alexandria will I
punysshe, and pour my wrothfull indignacion upon Sin which is the strength of
Egypt. All the substance of Alexandria will I destroy, and kyndle a fire in
Egypt.

Sin shall be in great heaviness, Alexandria

As for the Egypcians, I will scatre them among the Heithen, and strew them in
ye lands about. Again I will strentgh the arm of the king of Babylon, and
give him my swerd in his hand: but I will break Pharaos arm so that he shall
hold it before him piteousely like a wounded man.

Yea I will stablyshe the king of Babylons Pharao.
and the arms of Pharao shall fall down: that it may be known, that I am the
Lord, which give the king of Babylon my swearde in his hand, that he may
draw it out upon the land of Egypt: and that when I scatre the Egypcians

All the lyghtes of heaven will I put out over the, and bring darckenesse upon

bring thy destruction among the Heithen and countries whom thou know
not. Yea I will make many people with their kings so afraid through the, that

For thus says the Lord: God: the king

All they that be mighty among the Ge^tyles, shall waste the proud pomp of
Egypt and bring down al her people. All the cattle also of Egypt will I
destroy, that they shall come no more upon the waters: so that neither man's

clear, and cause their floudes to run like oil, says ye Lord God: when I
make the land of Egypt desolate. and when the countreye with all that is
therein. shall be laid waste: and when I smite all them which dwell in it,
that they may know, that I am the Lord. This is the mournyng, that ye
daughters of the Heithen shall make: Yea a sorrow and lamentacion shall they take

There is Elam also with all his people, and their graves round about: which

Should not they then lie among the worthyes, and vncircumcysed Gyauntes?
which with their weapons are gone down to hell: whose swerdes are laid under
their heads, whose wickedness is upon their bones: because that as worthyes,
they have brought fear in to the land of the living? Yea among ye
vncicumcysed shall thou be destroyed, and sleep with them, that perysshed

There is the land of Edom with her kings Ierem.xlix. b Ezechi.xxv. b xxxv. a.

Moreover, there be all the princes of the north, with all the Sidonians, which
are gone down to the slain.

With their fear and strength they are come to confusyon, and lie there
vncircumcysed, among those that be slain with the sword and bear their

Now when Pharao seith this, he shall be comforted over all his people, that is
slain with the sword: both Pharao and all his hooste, says the Lord God.
For I have given my tear in the land of the living. But Pharao and al his
people shall lie among the vncircumcysed, and among them that be slain

He sets out the office of a preacher. He strengthens them that despair,

Prophet.

CAPI. XXXIII.
Again, the word of the Lord came Preachers be watchme^.
Thou son of man Speak to the children of thy people, and tell them: When I
send a swearde upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their
country, and set him to be their watchman: iiii. Reg.ix. d.
the same man (when he seyth the sword come upon the land) shall blow the
trompette, and warn the people.

If a man now hear the noise of the trompet and will not be warned, and the
sword come and take him away: his blood shall be upon his own heed: for he
herd ye sound of the trompette, and would not take heed, therefore his blood
be upon him. But if he will receive warning, he shall save his life.

Again, if the watchman se the swearde come and show it not with the trompet,
so ye the people is not warned: if the swerd come then, and take any man from
among the: the same shall be taken away in his own sin, but his blood
will I require of the watchmans hand.

And now (O thou son of man) I have made the a watchman unto the house of
Israel: Ezechie.iii.c.
that where as thou hear any thing out of my mouth, thou may warn them
on my behalf. It I say unto the wicked thou wicked, thou shalt surely dye:
and you gyuest him not warning, that he may beware of his ungodly way: then
shall the wicked dye in his own sin, but his blood will I require of thy
hand. Nevertheless if thou warn ye wicked of his way, to turn from it, where
as he yet will not be turned from, it the^ shall he dye because of his sin,
but thou haste delivered thy soul.

Ezech.xviii. e
I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but much rather that the
wicked turn from his way and live. Turn you, turn you from your ungodly
ways, O ye of the house of Israel. Oh, wherefore will ye dye?

Ezec.xviii. d.
Thou sone of man, tell the children of thy people:
The rightousnesse of the ryghtous shall not save him, when so ever he turns
away unfaithfully: Again, the wickedness of ye wicked shall not hurt him, when
soever he conuerteth from his ungodliness.

And the ryghtousnesse of the ryghtous shall not save his life, whansoeueuer he
sins.

If I say unto the ryghtous, that he shall surely live, and so he trust to
his own rightousnesse, and do sin: then shall dis rightousnesse be no more
thought upon, but in the wyckenesse that he has done he shall dye.

Esaye.lv. b Iere.xviii. ^
and so he turn from his sins, and do the thing that is lawful and right:
In so much that the same wicked man gives the pledge again, restores that he
had taken away by robberye, walks in ye commandments of life, and does no
wrong: Then shall he surly live, and not dye. Yea the sins yt he has done,
shall never be thought upon.

For in so much as he does now the thing that is lawful and right, he shall
live. And yet the children of thy people say: Tush, the way of the Lord is not
right, where as their own way is rather unright.

When the rightous turns from his rightousnesse, and does the thing that is
wicked, he shall dye therefore. But if the wicked turn from his wickedness,
Ezech.xviii. f Roma.ii. a
doing the thing that is lawful and right, he shall live therefore. Yet ye
say: the way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge
every one of you after his ways.



Then came the word of the Lord unto me, and said: Thou son of man, these
that dwell in the wasted land of Israel, say Abraham was but one man, and he
had the land in possessyon now are we many, and the land is given us to
possess also.

And therefore tell them: Thus says the Le^ (...)
your eyes have ye lift up to Idols, and have shed blood: shall ye then have
the land in possession.

Ye lean upon your sweardes, ye work abhominacyo^s, every one defyleth his
neighbors wife: and shall ye then possess the land? Say thou these words
unto them: Thus says the Lord God: As truly as I live all ye that dwell in
this wilderness, shall be slain with the sword: what so ever is upon the field,
will I give unto the berstes to be devoured: those that be in strong holds
and dens, shall dye of the pestylence. For I will make the land so desolate
and waste, and the pomp of her strength shall come to an end. The mountains in
Israel shall be so waste that no man shall travail thereby.

Then shall they learn to know, that I Ezech ^

come unto the, after the manner of a great people: ye my people sit down before
the, and hear thy words but they do not thereafter: for i^ their mouths they
show them selves,
as though they were fervent, but their heart goes after their own covetous
lucre.

And as a ballet yt has a sweet tune, and is plesaunt to sing, so shalt thou
be unto them: thy words shall they hear, but they will not do thereafter. When
this comes to pass (for lo, it comes in deed) then shall they know, that
there has been a Prophet among them.

Behold, I will look to my sheep my self, and seek them. Like as a shepeherde

I seek after my sheep, and gather them together out of all places, where they
have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. I will bring them out from all
people, and gather them together out of all lands. I will bring them in to

such as be fat and well likinge, those will I preserve. and feed them with the

Moreover, I will make a couenaunte of peaxe with them, and drive all evil
beasts out of the land, so they that may dwell safelye in the wilderness,

send them in one season, that the trees in the wodde may bring forth their
fruits, and the ground her increase. They shall be safe in their land, and
shall kn^we that I am the Lord, which have broken their yoke, and delivered

their own ways and ymagynacions / so yt in my sight their way was like the
uncleanness of a me^struous woman. Wherefore I poured my wroth full displeasure
upon them, because of the blood that they had shed in the land, and because
of their ydols, wherewith they had defiled them selves. I scatred them also
among the Hethen, so that they were strowed about in the lands. According to
their ways, and after their own^ inuencions, so did I punysshe them.

Now when they were gone unto the Heathen, and come in among them, they

so that it was said of them: Are these the people of God, and must go out of

of Israel) but for my holy names sake, which ye dishonored among the
Heathen, when ye came to them. Therefore, I will halowe my great name again,
which among the Gentiles is evil spoken of: for ye your selves have
dishonored it among them. And the Gentiles shall know that I am the Lord,
when I am honored in you before their eyes, says the Lord God.

As for you, I will take you from among the Heathen, and gather you together
out of all countries, and bring you again in to your own land. Then will

uncleanness, and from all your Idols shall I cleanse you. A new heart also

I will give my spirit among you, and cause you to walk in my

Then shall it be said: this waste land is become like a gardeyn of pleasure,
and the void, desolate and broken down cities are now strong and fensed

that I am the Lord which repair that was broken down, and plant again
that was made waste. Even I the Lord have spoken it, and will do it in deed.

Thus says the Lord God: I will yet ones be found again of the house of

Like as the holy flock, and the flock of Jerusalem are in the high solemn

After that, he brought me to the Southe side, where there stood a door

first windows. The heygth was.l.cubits, the breadth.xxv. with steps to go up
upon: his porche stood before him, with his pyllers and date trees on either
side. And the door of the innermer court stood toward the South, and he
measured from one door to an other an hundred cubits.

So he brought me in to the innermer court through the door of the South side,
which he measured, and it had the measure before said. In like manner his
chambres, pyllers, and fore entryes, had even the fore said measure also. And
he had with his porches round about wyndowes of fyftye cubits heygth, and
five and twe^tye cubits broad. The porches round about were.xxv.cubits
long, and five cubytes broad: and his porche reached unto the uttermost
court: upon his pyllers there were date trees, and eyghte steps to goo up

And he brought me to the north door, and measured it, which also had the fore

stood before the house: And he brought me to the fore entry of the house and
measured the walls by the entry door: which were five cubytes long on either

And he said unto me: this is the holiest of all. He measured also the wall of

whereof there were thyrtie and three. And there stood posts beneth by the walls
round about ye house, to bear the^ up: but in, the wall of the house, they were
not fastened. The side chambres were the higher ye wyder, and had steps
through them round above the house. Thus was it wyder above, that from the
lowest men might go to the highest and myd chambers, I saw also that the house
was very high round about. The foundation of the side chambres was a meterod

Thus was it made round about in all the house: Yea the Cherubins and date

The temple and the holiest of all had either of them two doors and every door
had two little wickettes which were folden in one upon an other, on every side

made deep windows and date trees, having beams and balkes, like as the house

THE BOOK OF THE PROPHET DANIEL.
The Prophet shows the captyuytye of Ioakym king of Judah. Of the sons
that were in captyuytye, the king commands to chose which of them should
be taught the lernyng and language of the Caldees. They are allowed the kings
fedynge. Daniel abstayneth from the meat of the king of Babylon. The science

came Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it: and the
Lord deluered Ioakim the king of Judah in to his hand: with certain
ornaments of the house of God: which he carried away unto the land of Sennar,
to the house of his God, and there he brought them in to his gods treasury.
And the king spoke unto Asphanaz the chief chamberlayne, that he should
bring him certain of the children of Israel that were come of the kings
seed, and of Princes, young spryngoldes without any blemysshe, but fair and
welfauoured instruct in all wisdom, conning and understanding, which were
hable to stand in the kings palace, to read, and to learn for to speak
Caldeish.

Gene.xiii. ^ Tobi^ b. Iudit.xii. a
And this he desired of the chief chamberlayne, leest he should be defiled him
self. So God gave Daniel favor and grace before the chief chamberlayne, that
he said unto him: I am astayde of my lord ye king, which has appointed you
your meat and drink, leest he spy your faces to be worse liking then the
other spryngoldes of your age, and so ye shall make me lost my heed unto the
king.

Then Daniel answered Melasser, whom the chief chamberlayne had set over
Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias, and said: O prove but ten days with thy
servants, and let us have potage to eat, and water to drink / then look
upon our faces, and theyrs that eat of the kings meat. And as thou see,
so deal with thy servants. So he consented to them in this matter, and
proved them ten days. And after the ten days their faces were better liking,
and fatter then all the young spryngoldes which ate of ye kings meat.

Thus Melassar took away their meat and

Therefore stood they before the king, which in all wisdom, and matters of

The dream of Nabuchodonozor. He calls unto him sothsayers, and requires of
them, both the dream and the interpretacyon thereof. They answer that they can
not show it. The king commands all the wise men of Babylon to be slain.
Daniel requires time to solute the questyon. The Lord opens the mystery
unto Daniel. Daniel is brought unto the king, and shows him his dream and
the interpretation thereof. Of the everlasting kingdom of Christ. The stone

CAPI. II.
IN the second year of the raygne of Nabuchodonosor, (...)
had Nabuchodonosor a dreme where through his spirit was vexed, and his stepe
brake from him. Then the king commanded to call together all the
sothesayers, charmers, witches and Caldees, for to show the king his dream.
So they came and stood before the king. And the king said unto them: I have
dreamed a dream, and my spirit was so troubled therewith, that I have clean
forgotten what I dreamed. Upon this the Caldees answered the king in the
Syryans speech: O king, God save thy life for ever. Show thy servants the
dream, and we shall show the what it means. The king gave the Caldees their
answer, and said: It is gone fro me: If ye will not make me understand the
dream, with the interpretacion thereof, ye shall dye, and your

They answered again and said: The king must show his servants the
dreme and so shall we declare what it means. Then the king answered,
saying: I perceive of a truth, that ye do but prolonge the time: for so much
as ye se that the thing is gone fro me. Therefore ye will not tell me the
dream, ye shall all have one judgment. But ye feign and dissemble with vain
words, which ye speak before me, to put of the time.

Therefore tell me the dream, and so shall I know if ye can show me what it
means. Upon this the Caldees gave answer before the king, and said: there
is no man upon earth that can tell the thing, which the king speaks of:
Yea, there is neither king, Prince nor Lord, that ever asked such things at
a sothesayer, charmer or Caldee: for it is a hard matter, that the king
requires. Neither is there any, that can certifye the king thereof, except
the gods: whose dwelling is not among the creatures.



He answered and said unto Arioch being then the kings deputy: Why has the
king proclaimed so cruel a sentence? So Arioch told Daniel the matter. Upon
this went Daniel up, and desired the king that he might have leisure to show
the king the interpretacion / and then came he home agaynne, and showed the
thing unto Ananias, Misael, and Asarias his companions, that they should
beseech the God of heaven for grace in this secret, that Daniel and and his
fellows, with other such as were wise in Babylon, perysshed not.

(...)
he puts down kings / he sets up kings: he gives wisdom unto the
wise, and understanding to those that understand: he opens the deep
secrets: he knows the thing that lies in darkness, for the light dwells
with him. I thank the, and praise the (O thou God of my fathers) that thou
have lent me wisdom and strength, and have showed me the thing that we
desired of the, for thou have opened the kings matter unto me.

Upon this went Daniel in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to
destroy the wise at Babylon: he went unto him and said: destroy not such as
are wise in Babylon, but bring me in to the king, and I shall show the king
the interpretacion. Then Atioch brought Daniel in to the king in all the haste,
and said unto him: I have found a man among the prisoners of Judah, that
shall show the king the interpretacion. Then answered the king, and said
unto Daniel, whose name was Balthazar: Art thou he that can show me the
dream, which I have seen, and the interpretacion thereof? Daniel answered the
king to his face, and said: As for this secret, for the which the king
makes inquisicion: it is neither the wise, the sorcerer, the charmer, ne the
devil coniurer, that can certifye the king of it: Only God in heaven can
open secrets, Math.xi. ^
and he it is that shows the king Nabuchodonosor, what is for to come in the
latterdayes.

Thy dreme, and that which thou have seen

This thou saw, Math xxi.c Luke.xx. b
till the time (yt without any hands) there was hewn of a stone, which smote
the image upon the fete, that were both of iron and earth, and brake the^ to
pouther: then was the iron, the earth, the copper the silver and gold broken all
together in pieces: and became like the chafe of corn, that the wind blows
away from the sommrer floores, that they can no more be found. But the stone
ye smote the image became a great mountain, which fulfilleth ye hole earth:
this is the dreme. And now will we show before ye king, what it means.

O king, thou art a king of kings: For Daniel, v. d
and has delivered the all things that are among the children of men: the
beasts of the feld, and the fowls under the heaven, and given the domynion
over them all. Thou art that golden heed. After the, there shall arise an
other kingdom, which shall be less then thine. The third kingdom shall be
like copper, and have damynacion in all lands. The fourth kingdom shall be
as strong as iron. For like as iron broseth and breaks all things: Yea even
as iron beats every thing down, so shall it beat down and destroy.

Where as thou saw the feet and toes part of earth and part of iron, that
is a deuydid kingdom, which nevertheless shall have some of the iron ground
myxte with it for so much as thou have seen the iron myxte with claye.

The toes of the fete that were part of yro^ and part of claye, signifies that
it shall be a kingdom partly strong, and partly weyke. And where as you saw
iron mixed with claye, they shall myngle them selves with the seed of simple
people, and yet not continue one with an other, like as iron will not be
souldered with a potsherd.

Esaias.ix. b
which shall not perysshe, and his kingdom shall not be given over to an other
people: yea the same shall break and destroy all these kingdoms, but it shall
endure for ever.

And where as you saw that without any hands there was cut out of the mount
a stone, which brake the iron, Hebr.xii. e
the copper, the earth, the silver and gold in pieces: by that has the great
God showed the king what will come after this. This is a true dreme, and the
interpretacion thereof is sure.

Then the king Nabuchodonosor fell down upon his face, and bowed him self
unto Daniel, and commanded that they should offer meateofferynges and sweet
odoures unto him. The king answered Daniel, and said: yea of a truth your
God is a God above all gods, a Lord above all kings, and an opener of
secrets, saying thou canste discover this mystery. So the king made Daniel a
great man, and gave him many and great gifts.

He made him ruler of all the countries of Babylon, and lord of all the
nobles that were at Babylon. Now Dani^l entreated the king for Sidrach,
Misach, and Abednago so that h^ made them rulers over all the offices in the
land of Babylon. But Daniel him self remained still in the court by the
king,

The king sets up a golden Image, which he commands to be worshypped.
Sydrach, Mysach, and Abednago are accused, because they dysspysed the kings
commandment. They are brought unto the king and commanded to worship the
Image. They refuse to do it, and are put in to a burning oven. By bylefe in
God, they are delivered from the fire. Nabuchodonozor confesses the power of
God after the sight of the miracle.

CAPI. III.


Now when they stood before the image, which Nabuchodonosor set up, the
bedell cried out with all his might: O ye people, kynredes and tunges, to you
be it said: that when ye hear the noise of the trompettes which shall be
blown, with the harpes, shawmes, psalteryes, symphonyes, and all manner of
musyke: ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nabuchodonosor the
king has set up. Who so then falls not down and boweth him self, shall
even the same hour be cast in to an hot burning oven. Therefore, when all the
folk herd the noise of the Trompettes that were blowe^, with the Harpes,
Shawmes, Psalteryes, Symphonyes, and all kind of melody: then all the people,
kynredes and nations fell down, and bowed them selves unto the golden image
that Nabuchodonosor the king had set up.

Now were there certain men of the Caldes

Now are there certain Jews, whom thou have set over the offices of the land
of Babylon: namely, Sidrach, D^^^
Misach and Abednago. These men (o king) regard not thy commandment, yea
they will not serve thy gods, ne bow them selves to the golden image that thou
have set up.

Then Nabuchodonosor in a cruel wrath and displeasure, commanded, that
Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago should be brought unto him. So these me^ were
brought before the king. Then Nabuchodonosor spoke unto the^ and said: what? O
Sidrach, Misach and Abednago, will not ye serve my gods? nor bow your selves
to the golden image, that I have set up? well be redye hereafter, when ye hear
the noise of the trompettes blow with ye Harpes, Shawmes, Psalteryes,
Symphonyes, and all the other melodyes: that ye fall down and worship the
image which I have made. But if ye worship it not, ye shall be cast
immediatlye in to an hot burning oven. Let se, what God is there, that may
deliver you out of my hands? Sydrach, Misach, and Abednago answered the
king, and said: O Nabuchodonosor, we ought not to consent unto the in this
matter, for why? our God whom we serve, (...)
is hable to keep us from the hot burning oven (O king) and can right well
deliver us out of thy hands. And though he will not,

So these men were bound in their cotes, hosen, shoes, with their other
garments, and cast in to the hot burning oven: for the kings commandment
was so strayte, and the oven was excedyng hot. As for the men that put in
Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago, the flame of the fire destroyed them. And these
three men: (...)
Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago, fell down in the hot burning oven, being
fast bound.

Then Nabuchodonosor the king marueyled, and stood up in all haste: he spoke
unto his counsel and said: did ye not cast these three men bound in to the
fire? They answered, and said unto the king: Yea, O king. He answered and
said: Lo for all that, yet do I se four men going loose in the myddest of
the fire, and nothing corrupt, and the fourth is like an angel to look
upon.

Upon this went Nabuchodonosor unto ye mouth of the hot burninge oven: (...)
he spoke also, and said: O Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago,

Then spoke Nabuchodonosor and said: Blessed be the God of Sidrach, Misach,
and Abednago: which has sense his angel, and defended his servants, that
put their trust in him / that have altered the kings commandment, and
ieoparde their bodies thereupon, rather then they would serve or worship any
other God, except their own God only.

Therefore I will and command, that all people, kynredes and tunges, which
speak any blasphemye against the God of Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago, shall
dye, and their houses shall be prysed: Because there is no God that may save,
as t^^s. So the king promoted Sydrach, Misach, and Abednago, in the land of
Babylon.

Nabuchodon^zor dreameth again. Daniel int^^preteth it. Nubuchodonozor is put
out of his ^^^lme, and eats with beasts. He confesses the power of God,
and is restored in to his kingdom.

and how mighty are his wonders? His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and
his power lasts for ever and ever.

I Nabuchodonosor being at rest in mine house, and flourysshynge in my palace,
saw a dream, which made me afraid / and the thoughts that I had upon my
bed, with the visions of my heed troubled me. Then sent I out a commission,
that all they which were of wisdom at Babylon should be brought before me, to
tell me the interpretacyon of the dream.

So there came the sothsayers, charmers, Caldees and coniurers of deuyls / to
whom I told the dream, but what it betokened they could not show me: till at
the last there came one Daniel (otherwise called Balthazar, according to the
name of my God) which has the spirit of the holy goods in him: to whom I
told the dream, saying: O

The beasts of the field had shadows under it, and the fowls of the air
dwel^e in the bows thereof. Shortly, all creatures fed of it. I saw in my heed
a vysion upon my bed: and behold, a watcher came down from heaven, and
cried myghtylye, saying: Hew down the tree, break of his branches, shake
of his leaves, and scatre his fruit abroad: that all the beestes may get
them away from under him, and the souls from his branches. Nevertheless,
leave the ground of his root still in the earth, and bind him upon the
plain field, with cheynes of iron and stele. With the dew of heaven shall he
be wet, and he shall have his part in the herbs of the ground with other wild
beasts.

That man's heart of his shall be taken from him, and a beasts heart shall be
given him, t^ll seven years he come and gone upon him.

This errande of the watcher, is a commandment gives them to whom it lyketh
him, and brings for very ou^ castes of men over them. This is the dream
that I king Nabuchodonosor have sent: therefore, O Balthazar, tell thou the what
it signifies: for so much as all the wise men of my kingdom are not hable to
show me what it means. But thou can do it, for the spirit of ye holy
gods is in the.



Even thou (O king) at the tree, great and strong. Thy greatness increases,
and reaches unto the heaven, so does thy power to the ends of the earth. But
where as the king saw a watcher, even an holy angel, that came down from
heaven, and said: hew down the tree, and destroy it: yet leave the ground
of the root in the earth: and bynd him upon the plain selde, with cheynes of
iron and stele. He shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and his part shall be
with the beasts of the field, till seven years be come and gone upon him. This
(O king) is the interpretacion / yea it is the very device of him that is
highest of all, and it touches my Lord the king.

Job.xiiii. b Daniel.v. a
with grass shalt thou be fed like an ox. Thou must be wet with the dew of
heaven: Yea, seven years shall come and goo upon the, till thou know that the
hiest has power upon the kingdoms of men, and gives them to whom he list.
Moreover, where as it was said that the root of the tree should be left still
in the ground: Daniel.ii.c Iere.xxii. a.
it betokens ye thy kingdom shall remain hole unto the, after thou haste
learned to know, that the power comes from heaven. Wherefore, O king, be
content with my counsel, that thou maysse loose thy sins with ryghtousnesse,
and thine offenses with mercy to poor people / for such things shall prolong
thy peax. Luke.xi. Thobi.iiii.
All these things touch the king Nabuchodonosor.



When this time was past, I Nabuchodonosor Daniel ^
all they that dwell upon the earth, are to be reputed as nothing.

He handles according to his will among the powers of heaven, and among the
inhatauntes of the earth / and there is none that may resyst his hand, or
say: Psalm.i^
what do thou? At the same time was mine understanding given me again, Ioh.
^
and I was restored to the honor of my kingdom, to my dignity, and to mine
own shape again. My great estates and princes sought unto me, and I was set
in my kingdom again, so that I had yet greater worship.

Then did I Nabuchodonosor love, magnify and praise the king of heaven, for
all it is works are true, and his ways right. As for those that goo proudly, he
is hable to bring them down.

Balthazar king of Babylon abusing the vessels of the temple, seith an hand
writing in the wall. The othlayers called of the king, can not expound the
writing. Daniel is called, which reads it, and interprets it also.
Balthazar being slain, Darius succedeth in his rowine.

CAPI. V.
King Balthazar made a great banquet to ii (...)
that the king and his lords with his queen and concubines might drink therein.

So they brought the golden vessel yt was taken out of the temple of the
lords house at Jerusalem Then the king and his lords with his queen and
concubynes droncke of them. They drunk wine, and praised their ydolles of
gold, silver, copper, iron, wod and stone.

(...)
Then changed the king his countenance, and his thoughts troubled him, so
that the joints of his body shoke, and his knees smote one against the other.
Wherefore the king cried myghtely, (...)
that they should bring him the charmers, Caldees and consuters of deuyls. The
king spoke also to the wise men of Babylon, and said: Who so ca^ read this
writing, and show me the plain meaning thereof: shall be clothed with
purple, have a cheyne of gold about his neck, and rule the third part of my
kingdom.

Upon this, came all the kings wise me^: but they could neither read the
writing, ne show the king what it signified. Then was the king sore afraid:
in so much, that his color changed, and his lords were sore



Daniel answered, and said before the king: (...)
yet not the less. I will read the writtinge unto ye king and show him the
interpretacion thereof. O king, God the highest gave unto Nabuchodonosor the
father, the dygnyttie of a king, with worship and honor: so that all people,
kynredes and runges stood in awe and fear of him, by reason of the high estate
that he had le^t him. For why, he slew whom he would: he smote, whom it
pleased him. Again: whom he would, he set up: and whom he list, he put down.
Daniel.iiii. d.
But because his heart was so proud, and his stomach set so fast unto
wylfulnesse: he was deposed from his kyngly trone, and his majesty was taken
from him He was shot out from among men, his heart was like a beasts heart,
and his dwelling was with the wild asses: he was feign to eat grass like an
ox, and his body was wet with the dew of the heaven: till he knew that the
highest had power upon the kingdoms of me^, and sets over the^ whom he list.

And thou his son (O Balthazar) for all Act.xvii.c
thou haste not loved him.

Therefore is the palm of this hand sent hither from him, to token up this
wryttyng.

Then commanded Balthazar, to clothe Danyel with purple, to hang a cheyne of
gold about his neck, and and to make a proclaymacyon concerning him, that he
should be the ruler of the third part of his kingdom. Esaias.xlvii. b xxi. a.
Daniel.ix. a.
The very same night was Balthazar the king of the Caldees slain, and Darius
out of Medea took the kyngedome, being lxij year of age.

Daniel is made ruler over the lords. The imagynacyon of an act against
Daniel. The proclamacyon of the act, whereof Daniel is accused unto the king
as a transgressour. He is put in to a den of lions by the commandment of
the king. He is delivered by faith in God. Daniels accusers are put in to the
lions to be torn in sondre. Darius by the proclamacyon of a decree, magnifyeth
the God of Daniel.

CAPI. VI.
IT pleased Darius to set our his kingdom unto them, and the king to be
vndiseased.

But Daniel exceded all these princes and lords, for the spirit of God was
ple^teous in him: so that the king was minded to set him over the hole realm.
Wherefore the Princes and Lords sought, to pycke out in Daniel some quarrel
against the kingdom yet could they find none occasion ne fault upon him. For
why? he was so faithful, yt there was no blame ne dishonestye found in him.



So Darius made the writing, and confirmed

Then these men made search, and found Danyel making his peticion, and
prayenge unto his God: So they came to the king, and spoke before him
concerning his commandment, saying: O king, haste thou not subscribed the
statute, yt within thirty days who so requires his peticion of any God or
man but only of thy self, O king: he shall be cast into the den of the lions?
The king answered, and said: yea it is true. It must be as a law of the Medes
and Perses, that may not be b^oken.

Then answered they, and said unto the

These men perceyung the kings mind said unto him: know this (O king) yt
the law of the Medes and Perses is that the commandment and statute which
the king makes, Dani.xiiii. e
may not be altered. Then the king had them bring Daniel, and they cast him
into the lyo^s de^.

The king also spoke unto Daniel, and said: thy God, whom thou always seruest,
even he shall defend the. And there was

So the king went into his palace, and kept him sober all night, so that
there was no table spread before him, neither could he take any sleep. But by
times in the morning at the break of the day, the king arose, and went in
all haste unto the den of the Lions.

Now as he came nygh unto the den, he cried with a piteous voice unto Daniel:
yea the king spoke, and said unto Daniel: O Danyel, thou servant of the
living God is not thy God (whom thou always seruest) hable to deliver the from
ye Lions? Danyel said unto the king: O king, Daniel ^ Act. ^ii^ Iudi. ^ i
Reg. ^ Hebre.xi^
God save thy life for ever. My God has sent his angel, which has shut the
Lions mouths, so that they might not hurt me. For why? mine vngiltynesse is
found out before him. And as for the, O king, I never offended the.

Then was the king excedyng glad, and Hester. ^i^ Danie.x^
So the Lions had the mastry of them, and brake all their bones a sondre, or
ever they came at the ground.

After this, wrote king Darius unto all people kynredes, and tunges, Daniel ^
that dwelte in all lands: peace be multyplyed with you:

For he is the living God, Daniel.x^
which abides ever: his kingdom shall not fail, and his power is
everlasting. It is he that delyuereth, and saves: he does wonders and
marvelous works, in heaven and in earth: he has preserved Danyel from the
power of the lions. Esaye. ^ Osee (...)
This Daniel prospered in the reygne of Darius and Cirus of Persia.

A vision of four beasts is showed unto Daniel The vysion is interpreted of
four kingdoms of the world. Of the power and increa^e of Antichrist Of the
everlasting kingdom of Christ.

CAPI. VII.
IN the first year of Balthazar king of the sea, and four great beestes
came up from the sea one unlike an other.

The first was as a lyo^, and yet had he Egles wings. I saw, that his wings
were plucked from him, and he taken away from ye earth: that he stood upon his
fete as a man and that there was given him a man's heart.

(...)
Among his teeth in his mouth he had three great long teth, and it was said
unto him: Arise, eat up, much flesh.

Then I looked, and behold, there was an other like unto a Leoparde: this had
wings as a foul, even four upon the back.

This beast had four heads, and there was power given him.

(...) viii. b
After this I saw in a vysion by night, and behold the fourth beast was grym
and horible, and merueylous strong. (...)
It had great iron teth, it devoured and destroyed, and stamped the resydue
under his fete. It was far unlike the other beasts that were before it: for
it had ten horns, (...)
whereof I took good head.

(...)
His clothing was as white as snow, and the hears of his heed like the pure
woll. His trone was like the fyry flame, and his wheles as the burning fire.
(...)
There drew forth a fyrye streme, and went out from him. A thousand times a
thousand served him.x. M. times ten thousand stood before him. The judgment
was set, and the books opened. Then took I head thereunto, because of the voice
of the proud words, which that horn spoke I beheld, (...)
till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given over to be burnt
in the fire.

(...)
and behold, there came one in the clouds of heaven like the son of a man,
which went unto the old aged, before whom they brought him: Then gave he him
power and dignytie regal, (...)
that al people, teybes and tunges should serve him. His power is an
everlasting power, which shall never be put down: and his kingdom endures
vncorrupt. (...). f
My heart was vexed, and I Daniel had a troubled spirit within me, and the
visions of my head made me afraid: till I gate me unto one of them that stood
by, (...). d
to know the truth, concerning all these things. So he told me, and made me
understand the interpretacion of these things.

Apoca.xiii. a xvii.c
I desired also to know the truth, as touching the ten horns that he had
upon his head, and this other

The ten horns, are ten kings, that shall zacha.i.c
after whom there shall stand up an other, which shall be greater then the
first. He shall subdue three kings, and shall speak words against the
highest of all: he shall destroy the saints of the most highest, and chynke,
that he may change times and laws. They shall be given under his power, until
a time, two times, Daniel.ii.c. Apoc.xii. d
and half a time.

But the judgment shall be kept, so that his power shall be taken from him,
for he shall be destroyed, and perysshe at the last. As for the kingdom,
power, and all might that is under the heaven: it shall be given to the holy
people of the most highest, Luke.i.c Daniel.xiiii. ^
whose kingdom is everlasting / yea all powers shall serve and obey him.
Thus far extend the words. Nevertheless, I Daniel was so vexed in my
thoughts, that my countenance changed but the words I kept still in my
heart. Luke.ii.c


A vysyon of a strife between a ram and an he got. The understanding of the
vysyon, is of the batell between the king of Persia, and the king of the
Grecians. Of the shameless king Antichryste.

CAPI. VIII.
IN the third year of the rain of king Balthazar, there appeared a vysyon
unto Daniel.ii. a


Then I looked up, and saw: and behold, there stood before the river, a ram,
which had horns: and these horns were high, but one was higher then an other,
and the highest came up last.

I saw that this ram pusshed with his horns, against the weste, against
the north and against the south: so that no beasts might stand before him, ne
defend them from his power: but he did as him lysted, and waxed greatly. I to
took head unto this, and then came ^here an he got from the west over the hole
earth, and touched not the ground.



Da.vii. a.xi. a i. Machab.i. a
Yea out of one of the leest of these horns, there came up yet an other horn,
which waxed merueylous great: toward the southe, toward the cast, and toward
the fair pleasant land. It grew up to the hooste of heaven, whereof it did
cast some down to the ground, and of the stars also, and trod them under
fete.

Yea it grew up unto the prince of the host, from whom the daily offering
was taken, and the place of his Sanctuary casten down. And a certain season
was given unto it, against the daily offering (because of wickedness) that it
might cast down the veryte to the ground, and so to prospere in all things,
that it went about.





Then said he unto me: O thou son of man, mark well, for in the last time
shall this vysyon be fulfilled. Now as he was speaking unto me, I waxed
faint, so that I suncke down to the ground. But he took hold upon me, and set
me up again, saying: Behold, I will show the, what shall happen in the last
wrath: for in the time appointed it shall be fulfilled.

The ram which thou saw with the two horns, is the king of the Medes
and Perses: but the goote is the king of Gre^e land: the great horn thot
stood betwyxte his eyes, that is the principal king. But where as it brake,
and four other rose up to the stead: it signyfyeth, that out of this people
shall stand up four kingdoms, but not

After these kingdoms (while ungodliness is a growing) there shall arise a
king of an unshame fast face, which shall be wise in dark speakinges.

He shall be mighty and strong, but not in his own strength. He shall destroy
above measure, and all that he goes about shall prospere: he shall slaye the
strong and holy people. And through his craftynesse, falshed shall prospere in
his hand, his heart shall be proud, and many one shall he put to death in
his welthynes, He shall stand up against the Prince of Princes, ii. (...) ii.
(...)
but he shall be destroyed without hand. And this vysion that is showed unto
the, is as sure as the evening and the morning. Esaias (...)
Therefore write thou up this syghte, for it will be long or it come to pass.

Upon this was I Daniel very faynte, so that I lay syck / certain days: but
when I rose up, I went about the kings business, and marueyled at the
vysyon, nevertheless no man knew of it.

Daniel desires to have that performed of God which he had promised
concerning the return of the people from their ^anyshment in Babylon. A true
confession. Daniels prayer is herd. Gabryel the Angel expounds unto him
the visyon of the three score and ten wekes. The annoyntynge of Christ. The
building again of Jerusalem under Nehemias. The death af Christ. The
casting out of the wicked Jews.

CAPI. IX.
IN the first year of Darius the son of Daniel (...)
which was of the sede of the Medes, and was made king over the realm of the
Caldees: yea eue^ in the first year of his raygne, I Daniel desired to know the
yearly nombre out of the books, whereof the Lord spoke unto Jeremy the Prophet:
that Jerusalem should lie wast three score and ten years: and I turned me unto
God the Lord for to pray and make mine intercession, with fasting, sackcloth
and ashes, I prayed before the Lord my God, and knowledged, saying:

O Lord, thou great and fearful God, thou that kepest covenant and mercy
with them, which love the, and do thy commandments: We have sinned, (...)
we have offended, we have been disobedyent and gone back: yea we have
departed from all thy precepts and judgments.

We would never follow thy servants (...)
ryghtousnesse belongs unto the, unto us pertayneth nothing but open shame:
as it is come to pass this day unto every man of Judah, and to them that dwell
at Jerusalem: Yea unto al Israel, whether they be far or nyghe through out all
lands: wherein thou have strowed them, because of the offenses yt they had done
against the.

(...)
As for us, we are gone back from him, and have not obey to the voice of the
Lord our God, to walk in his laws, which he laid before us by his
servants the Prophets: (...)
yea al Israel have transgressed, and gone back from thy law, so that they
have not herkened unto thy voice.

Wherefore the curse and oath, that is written in the law of Moses the servant
of God (against whom we have offended) is poured upon us. (...) ^^vi. (...).
And he has performed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our
judges that judged us: (...)
to bring upon us such a great plage, as never was under heaven like as it
is now come to pass in Jerusalem. Yea all this plage, as it is written in the
law of Moses, is come upon us. Yet made we not our prayer before ye Lord our
God, that we might turn again from our wickedness, and to be learned in thy
veryte. Therefore has the Lord made haste, to bring this plage upon us: for
the Lord our God is ryghtous, in all his works which he does: for why, we
would not harken unto his voice.

(...)
to get thy self a name, which remains this day: we have sinned, O Lord,
and done wyckedly against all thy ryghtousnes: yet let thy wrothfull
dyspleasure be turned away (I beseech the) from thy city Jerusalem thy holy
hyl. And why? for our sins sake and for the wickedness of our fore fathers
is Jerusalem and thy people abhorred, of all them that are about us. Now
therefore, O our God, here the prayer of thy servant, and his intercession. O
let not thy face shine over thy Sanctuary, that lies wast.

O my God, enclyne thine ear, and harken

and touched me about the offering time in the evening. He infourmed me and
spoke unto me: O Daniel said he, I am now come to make the understand it:
For as soon as thou begannest to make thy prayer, it was so devised, and
therefore am I come to show the. And why? Daniel.x.c. d
For thou art a man greatly beloved.

Wherefore, pondre the matter well, that

He shall make a strong bond with many, for the space of a weke: and when
the weke is half gone, he shall put down the slain and meateofferynge.
Math.xxiiii.xxiii. Mark.xiii. ^
And in the temple there shall be an abhomynable desolacion, till it have
destroyed all. And it is concluded, that this wasting shall continue unto the
end.

There appears unto Daniel a man clothed in lynen, whche shows him wherefore
he is sent.

CAPI. X.
IN the third year of king Cirus of Persia,

Upon the.xiiij. day of the first month, I was by the great floude, called
Tigris: Daniel.vii. ^. Apoca.i.c
I lift up mine eyes, and looked: and behold, a man clothed in lynnen, whose
loins were gyrded up with fine gold of Araby: his body was like the
Chrisolite stone, his face (to look upon) was like lightening, his eyes as the
flame of fire, his arms and fete were like fair glysterynge metal, but the
voice of his words was like the voice of a multitude.

Daniel.iii. e Act.ix. a
saw it not: but a great fearfulness fell upon them, so that they fled away
and hyd them selves. I was left there my self alone, and saw this great
vision, so long till there remained no more strength within me: yea I lost my
color clean, I wasted away, and my strength was gone. Yet herd I the voice
of his words, and as soon as I herd it faintness came upon me, and I fell
down flat to the the ground upon my face. And behold, an hand touched me,
which set me up upon my knees and upon ye palms of my hands, saying unto
me: O Danyel, Dani.ix. b
thou well beloved man: take good head of the words, that I shall say unto
the, and stand right up, for unto the am I now sent.

And when he had said these words, I Iosue.v. d Dan^^^.xii. a
But lo Michael one of the chiefest, princes, came to help me, him have I left
by the king of Persia, and am come to show the what shall happen unto thy
people in ye latter days: For it will be long yet or the vysyon be fulfilled.

Now when he had spoken these words unto me, I cast down my heed to the
ground and held my tunge. Behold, there touched my lyppes one very like unto
a man. Then opened I my mouth, and said unto him, that stood before me: O my
Lord, my joints are lowsed in the vision, and there is no more strength
within me: How may my Lords servant then talk with my Lord? saying there
is no strength in me, so that I can not take my breath? Upon this there touched
me again, one much like a man, and comforted me saying: O thou man so well
beloved, fear not: Daniel.ix. b
be content, take a good heart unto the, and be strong.



A prophecye of the kings of Persia. Of the kingdom of Greece. Of the kingdom
of Egypt, and or the bond thereof, and of the battle with the kingdom o^
Siria. O^ the Jews that fly unto the king of Egypt, whom Antiochus the king
of Siria persecuteth, which fygureth unto us Antichrist. The pride of
Antiochus.

CAPI. XI.
ANd in the first year of Darius of Medea, I stood by him, to comfort him, and
to strength him, and now will I show the the truth. Behold, there shall stand
up yet three kings in Persia, but the tourthe shall be far rycher then they
all. And when he is in ye chiefest power of his riches, he shall provoke every
man against the realm of Grekeland. Then shall there arise yet a mighty king
that shall rule with great dominion, and do what him list. (...)
And as soon as his kingdom comes up, i^ shall be destroyed, and divided
toward the four winds of the heaven. They that come after him, i. M^
shall not have such power and domynyon as he: but his kingdom shall be
scatered, yea even among other then those. And the king of the southe shall
be myghtyer, then his other princes. Against him there shall one make him
self strong, and shall rule his domynyon with great power.

But after certain years they shall be joined

As for their Idols and princes, with their costly Iewelles of gold and
silver, he shall carry them away captyues into Egypt, and he shall prevail
against the king of the north certain years. And when he is come in to ye
kings realm of the south, he shall be feign to turn again in to his own
land. Wherefore his sons shall be displeased, and shall gather together a
mighty great hooste of people: and one of them shall come, and go through
like a water floude then shall he return, and go forth with defyinge and
bostinge unto his own land.

Then the king of the south shall be angry and shall come forth to fight
against the

At the same time th^^e shall many stand up against the king of the south, so
that the wicked children of thy people also shall exal^e them selves (to
fulfill the vision) and then fall.

So the king of the north shall come to lay seige, and to take the strong
fensed cities: And the power of them of the southe shall not be hable to abide
him, and the best men of the people shall not be so strong as to resyst him.
Shortly, when he comes, he shall handle him as he list, and no man shall be so
hardy as to stand against him. He shall stand in the pleasant country, which
through him shall be destroyed. He shall set his face with all his power to opteyn
his kingdom, and to be like it. Yea that shall he do, and give him unto the
daughters among women, to destroy him. But he shall fail, neither shall he
obtain his purpose.



So after that he has taken truce with him, he shall handle disceytfully: that
he may get up, and overcome him with a small flock, and so with craftynesse
to get him to the fattest place of the land, and to deal otherwise then
either his fathers or graundfathers did. For he shall destroy the thing that
they robbed and spoiled, yea and all their substance, ymageninge thoughts
against the strong hold, and that for a time. His power and heart shall be
styrred up with a great army against the kings of the south, where therowe
the king of the south shall be moved then unto batell with a great and mighty
host also. Nevertheless he shall not be hable to stand, for they shall
conspyre against him. Yea, they that eat of his meat shall hurt him, so that
his host shall fall, and many be slain down.

(...)
and talk of disceyte at one table / but they shall not prospere: for why? the
end shall not come yet, unto the time appointed. Then shall he go home again in
to his own land with great good, and set his heart against the holy covenant, he
shall be busy against it, and the^ return home. At the time appointed he shall
come again, (...)
and go toward the south. So shall it happen otherwise then at the first: yet
ones again. And why? the ships of Cithim shall come upon him, that he may be
smytten and turn again, that he may take indignacion against the covenant of
holiness, to meddle against it. Yea he shall turn him, and draw such unto
him as leave the holy covenant.



Yea some of those which have understanding shall be persecuted also, that they
may be tried, purified and cleansed, till the time be out, for there is yet an
other time appointed. The king shall do what him list, he shall exalte and
magnifye him self above al, that is God. Yea he shall speak marvelous things
against the God of all gods, wherein he shall prospere, so long till the wrath
he fulfilled, for the conclusion is devised alredye. Apoca.xv. a
He shall not regard the God of his fathers, but his lust shall be upon women:
Yea he shall not care for any God, for he shall magnifye him self above all.
In his place shall he worship the mighty ydols: and the God whom his fathers
knew not, shall he honor with gold and silver, with precious stones, and
pleasant jewels.

This shall he do, seeking help and succor at the mighty ydols and strange
gods.

In the latter time shall the king of the south strive with him, and the king
of the North in like manner shall come against him with charrettes, horsemen,
and with a great many of ships. He shall come in to the lands, destroy and
go through: he shall enter also in to the fair pleasant land. Apoca.xii.c
Many cytyes and countries shall decay, except Edom, Moab, and the best of the
children of Ammon which shall escape from his hand. He shall stretche forth
his hands upon the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape him. For
through his going in, he shall have dominion over the trea^ures of silver and
gold, and over all the precious jewels of Egypt, Lybia, and Ethiopia.

Nevertheless the tidings out of the East and the North shall trouble him,
Apoca.xi.c
for the which cause he shall goo forth to destroy and curse a great
multitude. The tents of his palace shall be pytched betwixt the two sees, upon
the hylle of the noble Sanctuarye, Ap.xix. d.xx.c
for he shall come to the end of it, and then shall no man help him.

He prophecyeth the resurrection of the deed. The darcknesse of the prophecye
of Daniel.

CAPI. XII.
Apoca.xix.c
which stands on thy people side shall arise up, for there shall come a time
of trouble, Mat.xxiiii. b
such as never was se^s there began to be any people, unto that same time. Then
shall thy people be delivered, yea all those that be found written in the book.
Many of them that sleep in the dust of ye earth shall awake, Job.v.c i.
Corint.xv. e
some to the everlasting life, some to perpetual shame and reprore. The wise
(such as have taught other) shall glyster as the shynyng of heaven / and those
that have instruct the multitude unto godliness, Math.xiii.c
shall be as the sterres, world without end.



Apoca.x. a
Then herb I the man with the line^ clothes Apo.xi.c.xii.c
and swear by him which lives for ever: that it shall tarry for a ^ime, two
times and half a time: when the power of the holy people is clean scatred
abroad, then shall all these things be fulfilled.

Math.xiii. b
As for such as have understanding, they shall regard it. And from that time
forth that the daily off^ringe shall be put down, and the abominable
desolacion set up, there shall be a thousand, two hundredth, and.xc. days. O
well is him that wayteth, and comes to the. Mthre hundred, and.xxxv. days.
Goo thou thy way now till it be ended, take thy rest, and bide in thy lot,
till the days have an end.

despised thy name? In this, yt ye offer unclean bred upon mine altar. And if
ye will say: wherein have we offered any unclean thing unto the? In this that ye

sword and will fight: and when they are laid down from the wine, and so risen
up again, they can not tell what they did: judge ye now, is not wine the
stro^gest? For who would else take in hand to do such things? And when he
had spoken this he held his tongue.

The declaracyon of the two last sentences of the young men, propounded in the
Chapter before: of which ye last, that is, that veritye bears the vyctorye in
all things, is most commended and allowed. Darius writes letters to all the
rulers under him, that they should aid zorobabel to the building of
Jerusalem.

CAPI. IIII.
The king.
O ye men, are not they the stro^gest and most excellent, that conquer the
land and the sea, and all that is in the sea, and in the earth? Now is the
king lord of all these things, and has dominion of them al: and look what
he commands, it is done. If he send his men forth a warrefare, they goo,
and break down hills, walls, and cowres. They are slain, and slay (other
men) them selves, and over pass not the kings word. If they get the victory,
they bring the king all the spoil. Likewise the other that meddle not with
wars and fyghting, but til the ground: when they repe they bring tribute to
the king. And if the king alone do but command to kill, they kill / if he
command to forgive, they forgive / if he command to smite, they smite / if
he bid drive away, they drive away / if he command to build, they build /
if he command to break down, they break down / if he command to plant
they plant. The common people and the rulers are obedient unto him.

The third, whose name was Zorobabel, which had spoken of women and of
truth, began to say after this manner: O ye men, it is not the great king, it
is not the multitude of me^, neither is it wine that excels: Who is it then
that has the lordshyp over them? Have not women women.
borne the king and all the people that rule those things? Have not women
borne them, and brought the^ up, that plant the vines wherout the wine comes?
They make garments for all me^, they give honor unto all men, and without
women can not men live. If they gather gold and silver, and al precious
things, and se a fair well favored woman, they leave all together and turn
their eyes only unto the woman, and gape upon her and have more desire unto
her, then unto ye silver and gold, or any manner of precious thing. A man
leaves his father that brought him up he leueth his own natural country and
cleueth Gene.ii. d Math.xix. a i. Timot.v. d Ephesians.v.c
nor mother, ne country. By this the^ ye must needs know that women have the
dominion over you. Does it grieve you? A man takes his sword, and goes his
way to steal, to kill, to murder, to sail upon the sea, and sees a lion,
and goes in the darckenesse: and when he has stolen, disceyued and robbed,
he brings it unto his love. Again, a man loves his wife better then father
or mother: yea, many one there be that run out of their wits, and become
bondemen for their wives sakes: many one also have perisshed, and have been
slain, and have sinned because of women.

And now believe me, I know a king, which is great in his power, and all
lands stand in awe of him, and no man dare lay hand upon him: yet did I se
that Apame (the daughter of the great king Bartacus) the kings concubyne, sat
beside the king upon his right hand, and took of his crown from his heed,
and set it upon her own heed, and smote the king with her left hand.
Moreover

O ye men, are not women then stronger? Great is the earth, and hye is the
heaven that do these things. Then the king and the princes looked one upon an
other. So he began to speak of the truth. O ye men, are not women stronger?
Great is the earth, hye is the heaven, swyfte is the course of the sun, he
compasses the heaven round about, Ecclesi.i a
and fetches his course again to his own place in one day. Is he not
excellent that does this? Truth.
Yea great is the truth, and stronger then all things. All the earth calls
upon the truth, the heaven prayseth it, all works shake and tremble at it, and
with it is no vnrightous thing. Wine Esaias.xl. a Psalm.cxvi. ^
it endures, and is always strong: it lives and conquereth, for evermore
world without end.

The truth accepts no persons, it puts no difference bitwixte rich or
poor, betwyxte the mighty or simple, but does right unto every man, whether
they be evil or good, and all men are lovingly dealt with all in the works of
it. In the judgment of it there is no vnryghtous thing, but strength, kingdom
and power, and majesty for evermore. Blessed be the God of truth.

And with that he held his tongue, and all the people cried and said: Great is
the truth, and above all. Then said the king unto him: Ask what thou wylt,
more then is appointed in the writing, and I shall give it the, for thou art
found wyser then thy companyons: thou shalt sit next me, and be my kynsman.
Then said he unto the king: Remember thy promise and vow which thou have
vowed and promised (in the day when thou came to the kingdom) to build up
Jerusalem, and to send again all the vessels and jewels that were taken away
out of Jerusalem: which Cyrus separated when he offered in Babylon, and would
have restored them again even there. And thy mind was to build up the
temple, which the Edomytes brent when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Caldees.
This only (O king) is the thing that I require, this is the majesty, which
I desire and ask of the: that thou perform the vow which thou with thine
own mouth have made unto the king of heaven.

and wrote a lettre unto all the deputies and shreues, to all the Lords and
nobles, that they should convey him forth, and all them that would goo up with
him. He wrote a letter also unto all the shreues that were in Celosyria and
Phenices, and unto Lybanus, that they should draw Cedre trees from Lybanus
unto Jerusalem, to build the city withal. Moreover he wrote unto all the
Jews that were gone out of his realm in to Jury, because of the fredome, that
no officer no ruler nor shreue, should come to their doors: and that all their
land which they had conquered, should be free and not tributary. And that the
Edomites should give over the cities and villages of the Jews which they had
taken in: yea and that they should yearly give.xx. talentes to the buyldyng of
the temple, until yt time that it were finisshed, and to the daily halowing
of the brentoffringes (as it is commanded) ten talentes yearly also / and that
al they which come from Babylon to buyld the city should have fre liberty, they
and their children and all the priests.

He wrote the greatness also and commanded

He gave over also all the vessels that Cyrus had separated from Babylon, and all that Cyrus had given in commandment, the same charged he also that it should
be done and sent unto Jerusalem. Now when this young man was gone forth, he
turned his face toward Jerusalem, and praised the king of heaven and said: Of
the comes the victory, (...)
of the comes wisdom and clerenesse, and I am thy servant. Blessed art thou
which have given me wisdom: the will I praise, O Lord, thou God of our
fathers.

And so he took the letters, and went unto Babylon, and when he came there, he
told this unto all his brethren that were at Babylon, and they praised the God
of their fathers, that he had given them refresshynge and liberty to goo up
and to build Jerusalem, and the temple (which is there called after the name
of the Lord) and they reioysed with instruments and gladness seven days
long.

They that return to Jerusalem are nombred. They begin to lay the foundacyon
of the temple, but are let by the means of enemies, and so is the building
driven of by the space of two years.

So when the seventh month came, i. Esdr.iii. ^
and when the children of Israel were every man at his business, they came
all with one consent in to the court, which was before the East door. And
there stood Jesus the son of Iosedec, and his brethr^n the priests, and
Zorobabel the son of Salachiel, and his brethren, setting up an altar to
offer brent sacrifices upon it, as it is written in the law of Moses.

There came people ^^o of other countries, and the Heathen o^^ of ^andes to set
up ye altar in his place, and (...) sacrifices and brent offeringes unto the

commanded in the law: And daily offered they as according was, and made the
sacryfyces appointed, the offeringes also of the Sabbothes and of the new
Moons, and all holy feasts. And all they that vowed offringes unto the Lord,
began at the new Moon of the seventh month to offer unto God, for the
temple of the Lord was not yet builded. And they gave unto ye Masons and

And in the second year they came in to the temple of God at Jerusalem. In the
second month began Zorobabell the son of Salathiel, (...).
and Iesue the son of Ioseder and their brethren the prestes and Levites, and
all they that were come unto Jerusalem out of the captyuyte of Babylon, and
laid the foundation of the temple, in the new moan of the second month in
the second year that they were come in to Iewry and Jerusalem. And they
appointed the Levites (that were above.xx. year old) unto the service of the
Lord: so Iesua and his sons and his brethren all the Levites stood to
gyther, and performed the law and ordinance in the house of the Lord.

And the prestes stood, and had their garments and trompettes, and the
Levites, the sons of Asaph had Cymballes, gyuynge thanks and praises unto
the Lord, (...) xvii. b
according as David the king of Israel had ordained. And the song that they
did sing unto the Lord, (...).cxxxv. a
was after this manner: O sing unto the Lord* for he is gracyous, and his

according to the trybes and kinredes (such as had seen the house before) to
the buyldyng of this temple with great cry and great mourning, many also
with trompettes and great joy: In so much, that the trompettes might not well
be heard for the weeping and mourning. For the commen people blew goodly upon
the trompettes.

Then came the enemies of the trybes of Judah and BenIamyn, (...) iii. a
to know what that trompettynge and noise of shawmes might be. And they
perseyued that it was they which were come again out of captyuyte, and would
build the temple up a new unto the Lord God of Israel. So they went to
Zorobabel and Jesus, and to the rulers of the vyllages and said unto them:
Shall we build with you also? For we like wise have heard your Lord, and we
walk after the same manner, from the days of Asbazareth the king of Assiria,
which brought us hither. Then Zorobabel and Jesus and the rulers of the
vyllages of Israel said unto them: It is not mete that ye should build the
temple of our God with us: we our selves alone will build unto the Lord,
like as Cyrus the king of the Persians has commanded us. i. Esdr.i. ^


But the heithen in the land laid them selves against those that were in
Iewrye, held up the building from them, laid wait upon them preuylye,
stopped such as brought any thing to the^, forbad the^ to build, and hyndered
those that made them passage, that the buyldyng should not be so punyshed: and
this continued so long as king Cyrus lived: and so they put of the building
for the space of two years, until the raygne of king Darius.

hynderaunce, by the commandment of Darius.

CAPI. VI.
Notwithstanding in the second year i. Esdr.v.^
Aggeus and Zachary the son of Addo prophesied upon them in Iewry and
Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel. Then Zorobabel the son of
Salathiel and Jesus the son of Iosedec stood up, Agge.i.c
and began to build ye house of the Lord at Jerusalem, when the Prophets
of the Lord helped them.

At the same time came Sisennes the under Shreue in Syria and Phenices, with
the la^d lords and his companyons, and said unto them: Who has bydden and
commanded you to build the house, to make the rofe and all other things
again? And who are the work men, that build them? Nevertheless the elders of
the Jews had such grace of ye Lord that they would not be let (though they
were provoked thereto) but builded on still, until ye time of king Darius were
certifyed there of, and an answer received from him. The letter that these men
sent unto king Darius* was after this manner.

Sis^nnes the under Shreue in Siria and Phenices, and the landlordes with their
co^panyons,

Then asked ^e the elders, who had commanded them to make up the house and the
buyld^ng, and ^his ^he did to the intent that we might certyfy^ the perfectly:
and write unto the, the names of those that were the rulers of the work. So
they gave, us this answer: we are the servants of ye Lord, which made heaven
and earth: and as for this house it has been builded and set up before time by
ye great and mighty king of Israel. iii. Reg.vi. a
But when our fathers provoked God unto wrath, and sinned against the God of
Israel, iiii. Reg.xxiiii xxv. Jeremy.xxxix lii.
he gave them over in to the power of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon the king
of the Chaldees, which brake down the house, and bre^t it, and carried away
the people prisoners unto Babylon. i. Esdr.v.c
Nevertheless, in the first year that king Cyrus raygned at Babylon, Cirus the
king wrote and commanded to build up this house again: and all the
ornaments that Nabuchodonozor carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon, and
appropriated unto his own temple: these brought Cyrus forth again, and
delivered the^ to Zorobabel and to Salmanasar the under Shreue commaundynge
them that they should bring those same ornaments again to Jerusalem in to the
temple, and to begin from ye time forth, to build ye temple again in his own
place. The^ Salmanasar laid the foundation of the Lords house at Jerusalem,
and ever sense have they builded, and yet is it not ended. And therefore, O
king, if thou thynckest it good, let it be sought in the Lybraryes and rolls
of king Cyrus: if it be found then, that it is done with ye council and
consent of king Cyrus, and if our Lord the king be so minded, let him write
unto us thereof.

and so at Egbathanis in a little city in Medea there was found such a
writynge: In the first year of the raygne of Cyrus the same king Cyrus
commanded that the house of the Lord at Jerusalem should be builded again
(and odoures to be made there co^tynually unto the Lord) whose heygth shall
be.x.cubytes, and the bredeth xi.cubytes, and.iiij. square with three hewn
stones, with a loft of tymbre of the same country, yea with a new loft, and
the expencys thereof to be given of the house of king Cyrus.

And the orname^tes of gold and silver, ye Nabuchodonosor took out of the
house of ye Lord at Ierusaltm, shall be set again in ye temple at Jerusalem,
where they were before. Sisennes also the under shreue in Siria and Phenyces,
the princes and their companyons, and the other that be head rulers in Siria

and to pray for their lives. Let it be proclaimed also on every side, that
whosoever breketh or despyseth this commandment of ye king, shall be hanged
upon a galow (made of his own good) and all his goods shall be seasoned unto
the king.

The Lord therefore (whose name is there called upon) rote out and destroy all
the kings and people, that undertake by vyolence to hinder the same, or to
deal discourteously with the house of the Lord at Jerusalem. I Darius the king
have ordained, that these things shall be done with all dylygence.

The temple is finyshed and dedicate: and the feast of unleavened breed is

of Boccus, the son of Abisu, the son of Phineas, the son of Eleazar, the
son of Aaron the first priest. This Esdras went up from Babylon for he had
good understanding in the law, of Moses, that was given of the Lord God of
Israel, to be taught and done in deed. And the king favored him, and did him
great worship and honor, after all his desires. There went up with him also
certain of the children of Israel, of the prestes of ye Levites, of the
syngers, porters and mynisters of the temple at Jerusalem.

In the.vij. year of the the raygne of king Artaxerxes, in the.v. month, that
is in the vij. year of the raygne, they went from Babylon in the new moon
of the fyfth month, and came the high way to Jerusalem after his
commandment, like as the Lord had prospered their journey. For in these
Esdras gat great instruction that he should leave none of the things behind,
which are in the law and commandments of God. And he taught hole Israel

Then came the Secretaryes of king Artaxerxes, and delivered the wrytynges
(that were come from Artaxerxes the king) to Esdras the priest and reder of
the law of the Lord: And this is the copye of the letter. King Artaxerxes
sends his gretynge unto Esdras the preeste and reder of the law of the
Lord: Of frynshyp and good will I have ordained and charged, if there be any
of the Jews, of the prestes and Levites in my realm, which desires and is
content to go with the unto Jerusalem, that he may do it. Therefore if any be
minded to bear the company, let them come together, and go with the (like as I
am content and my seven fre^des my counselers) to se what they do at Jerusalem
and in Iewry, and keep the things according as thou have in the law of the
Lord and to bring the gifts unto God ye Lord of Israel, that I and my
fryndes have promised to Jerusalem, and all the silver and gold that is in the
country of Babylon, unto the Lord to Jerusalem, with the thing that is given
for the people in the Lords temple at Jerusalem: Yea that the same silver and
gold may be gathered, and oxen, ra^mes, sheep and gotes and other that be
long to these things: and that they may offer sacryfyces unto the Lord,
which is at Jerusalem,

And what so ever thou and thy brethren will do with silver and gold, that
do after thy mind, and after the commandment of the Lord thy God: and like
wise with all the holy vessels, that are given the for ye service of the house
of the Lord thy God: and other things whatsoever is necessary for the to the
work of the temple, that shall be given ye of the kings treasure: and look
what thou with thy brethren will do with the gold and silver, that do after
the will of the Lord.

And I king Artaxerxes have commanded the kepers of the treasures in Siria
and Phenices, that whatsoever Esdras the priest and reder of the law of the
Lord does write, it shall be given him: till an.C. talentes of silver, and of
gold in like manner: Of corn also an hundredth measures, and till an hundredth
vessels of wine, and other plenteous things without nombre. Let all things be
done after the law of the highest God, that ye wrath of God arise not in the
realm of the king and of his sons. I commau^d you also, that ye require no
tax ne trybute of the priests, Leuytes syngers, and ministers of the temple,
ne of the writers: and that no man have auctorytye to meddle any thing against
the^. As for the (O Esdras) set thou judges and arbytrers in the hole land of
Siria and Phenyces, after the wisdom of God: and learn al such as are
ignoraunte in the law of God thy Lord, and let al them that offend against
the law, be punyshed: whether it be with death with pain, to be condemned in
money, or to be banysshed.

Then said Esdras the writer. Blessed be i. Esdr.vii. d
that has given so good a mind and will in to the heart of the king to
magnifye his house that is at Ierurusalem, and has made me to be accepted in
the sight of the king, of his counsel, of his friends and of his nobles.

And so I was steadfast in my mind, according as the Lord my God helped me,
and I chose out men of Israel to go up with me. And these are the heads (after
their kinredes and houses of their fathers) that went up with me from Babylon,
i. Esdr.viii. a
out of the kingdom of Artaxerxes: Of the sons of Phares. Gersonius. Of ye
sons of Siemarith, Amenus. Of the sons of David, Accus, ye son of Cecilia.

Of the sons of Phares, Zachary: and with him there turned again an hundred
and fyftye men. Of the sons of the captain of Moabylon, Zarei, and with
him.ij. hundredth and.l. men. O the sons of Zachnes, Iechonias, Zecholy, and

of Esead, Johannes Ezechan, and with him. C. and x. men, Of the sons of
Adonicam those that were the last, and these are their names: Eliphaiam the
son of Gebell and Semeias, and with him.lxx. men. All these called I together
by the water Thia, where we pytched our tents three days, and there I
mustered them.



Then commanded I a fasting unto the young men before the Lord, i.
Esdr.viii.c
that I might desire of him a prosperous journey and a good way for us, yea
for us, for our children, and for the catel, because of the layinges awayte,
and I durst not require of the king men of horse and of foot, to conueye us
safely against our enemies, for we had said unto ye king, that the power of
the Lord our God should be with them, that seek him with their hole heart. And
therefore we besought God our Lord earnestlye because of these things, and he
was merciful unto us, and heard our prayer. And I separated from among the
rulers of the people, and from the prestes of the temple.xij. men, and Sebeia
and Asania, and ten men of their brethren with them. And I weied them the gold
and the silver and all the prestly ornaments of the house of our God, which the
king and his counsel, and his princes, and hole Israel had given. And when I
had weyed it. I gave the^ an.C. and.l. tale^tes in silver, and.C. talentes of
silver vessel, an.C. tale^tes of gold, and of golden vessel seven times
twentye, and vessels of other metal (yea of good metal).xij. glystrynge as
the gold, and said unto them: ye also are holy unto the lord, and the vessels
are holy, and the gold and the silver is promised unto the lord ye God of our
fathers, Be diligent now and keep it, until the time that ye deliver it to
the rulers of the people, to the Prestes, to the Leuite, and to the pryncypall
men of the cytyes of Israel in Jerusalem, and in the chamber of the house of
our God.

So the prestes and the Leuytes which received i. Esdr.viii* d
the silver and the vessel, brought it to Jerusalem into the temple of the
Lord. And from Thia we brake up the.xij. day of the first month, till we
came to Jerusalem. And when the third day was past, the weyed gold and silver
was delivered in the house oe the Lord the fourth day, unto Marimoth the son
of Ior the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phineas, and with them
were Iosabdus the son of Iesnet, Medias and the son of Banus, and certain
of the Leuytes to the nombre and to the weight: and the wayght of them were
written up the same time. As for those that were come out of captyuyte, they
offered sacrifyce unto the Lord the God of Israel: even.xij. oxen for all
Israel.lxxxvj. rams lxxij. sheep.xij. gootes for sin.xij. kyne for a
thankoffryng, al to ye sacrifyce of the Lord. And the kings commyssyon
delivered they unto the stewardes and debites of the king, and to the under
shreues in Celosyria and Phenices. i. Esdr ix. ^


Now when these things were done, the rulers came unto me, and said: The
generacyon of Israel, the Princes, the prestes and Levites, the strange people
and indwellers of the land, have not put away their uncleanness, from the
Cananites, Hethites, Pheresites, from the Moabytes, Egypcyans and Edomytes.

For both they and thyr sons have mengled them selves with the daughters of

and heavy. So al they that were moved through the word of ye God of Israel, came
unto me: and I sat still full of heaviness until the euenyng sacrifice. Then
stood I up from fasting, having rent clothes and the holy garment, kneled
down upon my knees, held out my hands unto the Lord, and said: O Lord, I
am confounded and ashamed before thy face, for our sins are become many upon
our heedes, and our wickednesses are exalted unto the heaven / for sense the
time of our fore fathers, we are in great syn unto this day. And for the sins
of us and our fathers, we with our brethren and with our prestes have been
delivered unto the kings of the earth, in to the sword, and in to captivity,
and became a spoil with confusion and shame unto this day. And now, O Lord
God, how great is the mercy that we have gotten of the? in that thou have
left us a rote and name in the place of thy Sanctuarye, to discover our light
in the house of the Lord our God, and given us meat at al times of our
mynystracion. And when we were in captyuytie, we were not forsaken of the Lord
our God: but he made the kings of Persia gracious and favorable unto us, so
that they gave us vitayles and meat, yea an^ leave to build up the ^emple of
our Lord God again, to repair the wasted places of Sion, and to dwell in
Iewry and Jerusalem. And now, O Lord, (...) ^ii. a (...)
Moreover, ye shall never seek to make peax with the^, yt ye may increase and eat
ye best in the land: and that ye may dyuyde the inheritance of the land unto
your children for evermore. As for the thing that now happens unto us, it
comes all for our wicked works and great sins, yet have thou given us
such a rote, yt we are come again into our own land: and we are so wicked
that we have broken thy statutes and commandments again, and mengled our
selves with the uncleanness of the outlandyshe Heathen. O Lord, art thou angrye
with us? will thou rote us clean out? that our rote and name remayn no more?
O Lord God of Israel thou art true, for our rote endures yet unto this
present day. And behold, now are we before the in our sins, now can we not
stand before the in them.

And when Esdras with this prayer had knowledged the sin, weeping, and lyenge
flat upon the ground before the temple, there gathered unto him from
Jerusalem a great multitude of men and women, of young men and maidens, for
there was a very great weeping and mournyng in the congregacyo^, So when
Iechonias the son of Ieheli one of the children of Israel cried, he said unto
Esdras: we have sinned against the Lord, because we have married outlandysshe
women of the Heathen. Now art thou over all Israel. We will swear an oath
therefore unto the Lord, that we shall put away all our wives, which we have
taken of the Heathen with their children: like as it is appointed the before
our fore elders. Stand up then, open thou it, and declare it plainly unto us,
according to the law of the Lord: for the matter belongs unto the, and we
will help the, quyte thy self manly. So Esdras arose, and took an oath of the
rulers of the Prestes and of the Levites, and of Israel, to do after these
things: and they swear.

After Esdras had read the law, the people put away their strange wives: and
then returns every man meryly unto his own dwelling.

all such as were gathered at Jerusalem out of captyuite, that whosoever came
not to Jerusalem within two or.iij. days according to the judgment of the
old lords of council) his goods should be taken from him, and be excluded
from the congregacyon of the captyuyte. And in three days were all they of the

vnryghtouslye, in that ye have taken outlandysshe wives to marriage, and so to
increase the sins of Israel. And now knowledge the same, and give praise unto
the Lord God of our fathers, and perform his will, departing from the

I Esdras saw upon the mount Syon a great people, whom I could not nombre,
and they al praised the Lord with songs of thankesgyuynge. And in the mids
of them there was a young man of an hye stature, more excellent then all they,
and upon every one of their heads he set a crown, and was ever higher and
higher, which I marueyled at greatly. So I asked the angel and said: Sir
what are these? He answered and said unto me: These be they that have put of
the mortal clothing, and put on the immortal, and have testified and
knowledged the name of God. Now are they crowned and receive the reward.

Then said I unto the aungel: what young person is it that crowns them, and
gives them the palms in their hands? So he answered and said unto me: It is
the son of God, whom they have knowleged in the world. Then began I greatly
to commend them, that stood so sty fly for the name of the Lord. And so the
angel said unto me: Go thy way and tell my people what manner of things, and
how great wond^rs of the Lord thy God thou have seen.

yet their reward appears not, and their labor has no fruit. For I have
gone here and there through the Heathen, and I se they be rich and welthye,

Come let us go up and fight against the trees of the wodde, that we may make
our land the wyder. The thought and deuyce of the wodde was but vain, and
nothing worth, for the fire came and consumed the wodde: The thought of the
floodes of the sea came likewise to naught, for the sand stood up and stopped
them. If thou were judge now between these two, whom would thou iustifye, or
whom would thou condemn? I answered and said: Verily it is a folysh thought
that they both have devised. For the ground is given unto the wod, and the sea also has his place to bear his flodes. Then answered he me and said:

even so they that dwell upon earth may understand nothing but that which is

Then answered I and said: I beseech the O Lord, let me have understanding:
for it was not my mind to be curious of thy high things, but such as we daily
meddle withal / namely, wherefore that Israel is blasphemed of the Heathen, and
for what cause the people (whom thou ever have loved) is given over to be

sent down much rain with a storm: and when the stormye rain was past, the
drops remained still. Then said he unto me: Like as the rain is more then
the drops, and as the fire exceadeth the smoke: even so the measure of the
things that are paste, has the upper hand. Then went the drops and the
smoke above: and I prayed and said: May I live (thynckest thou) until that

shepherde that leaves his flock in the hands of wicked wolves. Then said I
unto him: Go thy way fro me, and come not nigh me: and he herd it / and as I
said, so went he his way fro me.

And so I fasted seven days, mourning and weeping, like as Vriel the angel
commanded me. And after seven days, it happened that the thoughts of my
heart were very grievous unto me again, and my soul received the spirit of
understanding, and I began to talk with the most highest again, and
said: O Lord, Lord, of every wodde of the earth, and of all the trees
thereof, thou haste chosen the one only vyneyard, and of al lands of the hole
world thou have chosen the one pyt: and of all flowers of the ground, thou have
chosen the one lyly: and of all the depthes of the sea, thou have filled the
one river / and of all builded cities thou have hallowed Syon unto thy self:
and of all the fowls that are created, thou have named the one dove / and of
all the catel that are made thou have provided the one sheep, and among all the
multytudes of folks, thou have gotten the one people, and unto this people
who^ thou louedst thou gave a law that is proved of all.

And now, O Lord, why have thou given this one people over unto many? and
upon the one root thou haste prepared other, and why have thou scattered thy
one only people among many? which tread them down, yea which have ever
withstand thy promyses, and never byleued thy couenauntes? And though thou
werest enemy unto the people yet should thou punysshe them with thine own
hands.



And he said unto me: nombre me the things that are not yet come / gather me
together ye drops that are scatred abroad: make me the flowers grene again
that are wythered: open me the thing that is closed: and bring me forth the
wyndes that are shut up: Show me the image of a voice, and then shall I
declare the, the thing that thou labourest to know. And I said: O Lord, Lord
who may know these things, but he that has not his dwelling with men? As
for me I am unwise: How may I then speak of these things whereof thou ask
me. Then said he unto me: like as thou can do none of these things that I
have spoken of, even so can thou not find out my judgment, or in the end
the love that I have promised unto my people.

And I said: behold, O Lord, yet art thou nigh unto them that have no end:
and what shall they do that have been before me, or we that be now, or they
that shall come after us? And he said unto me: I will lyken my judgment unto
a ring. Like as there is no slacknesse of the last, even so is there no
swiftness of the first. So I answered and said: Could thou not make
those (that have been made, and that be now, and that are for to come) in one,
that thou myghtest show thy judgment the sooner? Then answered he me and
said: The creature may not haste above the maker, neither may the world
hold them at ones, that shall be created.

And I said: How haste thou said then

Then said he unto me: Even so have I given a chyldebed unto the earth, for
those that be sown upon it by process of time. For like as a young child
may not bring forth the things that belong to the aged, even so have I
ordained the world which I made.

And I asked and said: Saying thou haste now given me away, I will speak
before the: for our mother of whom thou have told me, is yet young, and now
she draws nigh unto age. He answered me and said: Ask a woman that bears
children, and she shall tell the. Say unto her: wherefore are not they (whom
thou have now brought forth) like those that were before the, but less of
stasture: and she shall answer the: They that be borne in the youth of
strength, are of one facyon: and they that are borne in the time of age (when
the chyldbed fails) are other wise. Consydre now thy self, how that ye are
less of stature then those that were before you, and so are they that come
after you less then ye, as the creatures which now begin to be old, and
have passed over the strength of youth. Then said I: Lord I beseech the, if
I have found favor in thy syghte, show thy servant, by whom do thou

end of this world, and Jacob is the beginnynge of it that follows. The hand

therefore when thou hear the words, be not afraid: for of the end shall
the word and foundacio^ of the earth be understand. And why? the word thereof
trembles and quaketh for it knows, that it must be changed

The books shall be opened before the firmament, and they shall se all
together, and the children of a year old shall speak with their voices: the
women with child shall bring forth untimely children of three or four months
old, and they shall live, and be raised up: and suddenly shall the sown places
appear as the unsown, the full store houses shall suddenly be found emptye, and
the trompet shall give a sound, which when every man hears, (...).v^i. ^
they shall be hastily afraid. At yt time shall fryndes fight one against an
other like enemies, and the earth shall stand in fear with them.

The sprynges of the wells shall stand still, and in three hours they shall
not run. Whosoever remains from all these things that I have told the,
shall escape, and se my salvation, and the end of your world. And the men
that are received, shall se it, they that have not tasted death from their
birth: and the heart of the indwellers shall be changed, and turned into another
meaning for evil shall be put out, and disceyte shall be quenched: as for
faith, it shall floryshe, corrupcio^ shall be over come: and the truth, which
has been so long without fruit, shall be declared. And it happened when he
talked with me, that I looked demurely upon him, before whom I stood, and these
words said he unto me: I am come to show the, the time of ye night for to
come.

If thou will pray yet more, and fast seven

And it happened after this, that I wept again, and fasted seven days in
like manner that I might fulfill the three wekes, which he told me. In the
eight night was my heart vexed within me again, and I began to speak before
the highest: for my spirit was greatly set on fire, and my soul was in
distres, and I said: O Lord, thou spakest unto thy creature fom the
beginning (even the first day) and saydest: Genes.i. ^
Let heaven and earth be made, and thy word was a perfect work. And then was
there the spirit, and the darknesses were yet on every side, and silence:
there was no man's voice as yet from the. Then commaundest thou a fair light to
come forth out of thy treasures, that thy work might appear and be seen.

Upon the second day thou made the spirit of the fyrmament, and
commau^dedst it to part a sundre, and to make a division betwixt the waters,
that the one part might remain above, and the other beneth. Upon the third
day thou broughtest to pass, that the waters were gathered in the seventh part
of the earth: Six parts have thou dried up and kept them, to the intent that
men might sow and occupye husbandrye therein. As soon as thy word went
forth, the work was made. For immediately there was great innumerable fruit,
and many diverse pleasures and desires of temptacion, flowers of chaungeable
color and smell, and this was done the third day.

Upon the fourth day thou commaundedst Deuteronomy.iiii.c Genes.i.c
and ye moon her light: the stars dydest thou set in order, and gave them
a charge: to do service eue^ unto man: that was for to be made. Upon the fyft
day thou saydest unto the seventh part (where the waters were gathered) that
they should bring forth diverse beasts, fowls, and fyshes. And so it came
to pass, that the dom water and without soul, brought forth living beasts
at the commandment of God, that all people might praise thy wondrous works.
The^ did thou preserve two souls, the one you calledst Enoch and the other
Leuiathan, and dyddest separate the one from the other: for the seventh part
(namely, where the water was gathered together) might not hold them both.
Unto Enoch thou gave one part, which was dried up the third day, that he
should dwell in the same part, wherein are a thousand hills. But unto
Leuiathan thou gave the seventh part, namely the moist, and, have kept him
to devour what thou wyle and when. Upon the syxte day thou gave
commandment unto the earth, that before the it should bring forth beasts,
catel, and all that crepe, and (besides this) Adam also whom thou made lord
of al creatures: Of him come we all, and ye people also, who^ thou have chosen
specially unto thy self. All this have I said now and spoken before the, that
I might show, how that the world is made for our sakes. As for the other
people which also come of Adam, thou haste said that they are nothing, but be
like a spetle, and have lykened the abundance of them unto a drop (that
falls) from the rose of the house.

And now, O Lord, the Heathen which have ever ben reputed as nothing, have
begone to be Lords over us, and to devour us: Exodusiiii. t
but we thy people (whom thou have called the first born, thy only begotten,
and thy fervent lover) are given into their hands and power. If the world now
be made for our lakes, why have we not the inheritance in possessyon with the
world? How long shall this endure?

The Angel shows Esdras many things to come.

CAPI. VII.


Item an other: A cite is builded and set upon a broad field, and is full of
goods: the entrance is narrow and sodeyn, like as if there were a fire at
the right hand, and a deep water at the left, and as it were only one strayte
pathe betwyxte them both, too small that there could but one man go there.

If this cite now were given to an heir, and he never went through the
perelous way, how would he receive his enheritau^ce? And I said: it is so
Lord. Then said he: Even so is Israel also a porcyo^. And why? for their sakes
have I made the world: and when Adam transgressed my statutes, then was the
thing judged that was done. Then were the entraunces of the world made
narrow, full of sorrow and travail: They are but few and evil, full of
parels and labor. For the entraunces of the fore world were wide and sure,
and brought immortal fruit:

If they now which entered i^to this world may not comprehend these strayte
and vain things, much less may they comprehend and understand the secret
things: Why disquietest thou thy self then, seeing thou art but a
corruptible man? And what would thou know, where as thou art but mortal?
And why have thou not received in to thine own heart the thing that is for to
come, but that is present?

Then said I: O Lord Lord, thou haste Deuteronomy.viii. ^
that ye ryghtous should inheret these things, but that the unfaithful and
ungodly wulde perysshe. Nevertheless the ryghtous shall suffer strayte things
and hope for wide: for they that have lived ungodly and suffered strayte
things, shall not se the wide.

And he said unto me: There is no judge above God, and none that has
understanding above the highest. For there be many that perysshe, because they
despise the law of God that is set before them. For God has given strayte
commandment to such as come, that they know what they do, and how they should
live: and if they kept this they should not be punysshed.

Nevertheless they were not obedient unto him, but spoke against him:
ymagyned vain things, and purposed to sin, and said moreover that there was
no God, and that God regarded it not. His ways have they not known / his law
have they despised, and denied his promyses: in his statutes and ordynaunces
have they not ben fathfull and steadfast, and have not performed his works.

And therefore Esdras, unto the full, plenty, and to the emptye, emtynesse.
Behold, the time shall come, that these tokens which I have told the, shall
come to pass, and the bryde shall appear: and the earth that now passes
away, shall be showed: and whosoever is delyu^red from the foresaid euelles,
shall se my wonders. For my son Jesus shall be openly declared, with those
that be with him: and they that remain, shall be merry in four hundred years.

After these same years shall my son

Then said I: Abraham prayed first for the Sodomites, (...) ^i. d (...). e
(...). ^^ii. b (...).vi.c (...) vii. a (...) v^ii.
and Moses for the fathers that sinned in wyldernes, and he that came after him
for Israel, in the time of Achas and Samuel: and David for the destruccyon, and
Solomon for them that came in to the Santuary, and Elias for those that
received rain and for the deed, that he might live: and Ezechias for the
people in the time of Sennacherib: and diverse other in like manner, which have
prayed for many.

Even now seeing the corrupt is growe^ up, and wyckednes increased, and the
ryghtous have prayed for the ungodly, wherefore shall it not be so now also?

He answered me, and said: This present world is not the end: there remains
much honor in it, therefore have they prayed for ye weak. But the day of dome
shall be the end of this time, and the beginning ye of immortalite for to come,
wherein al corrupcyon, vanissheth, al v^luptuousnes is lowsed all misbyleue
taken away ryghtousnesse grown, and and the verite spronge up. Then shall no
man be hable to save him that is destroyed, nor to oppress him that has gotten
the vyctorye. I answered then, and said: This is my first and last say ng:
that it had been better, not to have gyue^^ the earth unto Adam: or else when it
was given him, to keep him yt he should not sin. For what prop^^te is it for
men now in this present time to live in heaviness, and after death to look for
punishment? O thou Adam, what have thou done? For though it was thou that
sinned, thou art not fallen alone, but we all that come of the. For what
profyt were it unto us, if there be promised us an immortal time, where as we
meddle with deadly worck^s? and that there is promised us an everlasting hope,
where as we our selves are evil and vain? and that there are laid up for us
dwellynges of health and fredome, where as we have lived evil? and that the
worship of the highest is kept to defend them, which have led a pacyent life
where as we have walked in the most wicked ways of all? And yt there shall be
showed a paradyse, whose fruit endures for ever, wherein is fredome and
medecyne, where as we shall not goo in? for we have walked in vnpleasau^t
places: And that the faces of the^ which have absteyned, shall shine above the
stars, where as our faces shall be black and darcke? For while we lived and
did vnryghtouslye, we considered not, that we should suffer therefore after
death?

(...). d
Nevertheless they belyued him not, nether the Prophets after him. No nor me
which have spoken unto them, that heaviness should not reach unto them to their
destruction like as joy is for to come over those, that have suffered them
selves to be enfourmed in salvation.

I answered then and said: I know Lord, that the highest is merciful, in that
he has mercy upon them, which are not yet in the world, and upon those also
that walcke in his law: and that he is pacyent and long suffrynge, Roma.ii. a
toward those that have sinned in their works: and that he is lyberall to
give where as it requires: and that he is of great mercy, for he multiplieth
his loving kyndnesses toward those that are present, and that are past, and
to the^ which are for to come. For if he multyplye not his mercyes, ye world
shall not be made living, with those that dwell therein: He gives also, for if
he gave not of his goodness, that they which have done evil, might be eased,
the ten thousand part of men should not be made living. And if the judge
forgave not those that be healed with his word, and if he would destroy the
multitude that stryueth, there should be very few left in an innumerable
multitude.

Esdras prays God rather to look upon his own mercy, than on the sins of
the people.

CAPI. VIII.
ANd he answered me, saying: The Math.xx. b xxi. h
bu^ few shall be pres^rued. Then answered I and say or Then swalowe up the
wit (thou soul) and devour the understanding, for thou art agreed to harken
and to give ear, and willing to prophecye: for thou have no longer space
given ye, but only to live. O Lord wylt thou not give thy servant seaue, that
we may pray hefore the, and that thou may give sede unto our heart, and buyld
our understanding, that there may come fruit of it: and that every one which
is corrupt, and bears the state and place of a man, may live?

For thou art alone, and we al are one worckmanshyp of thy hands, like as thou
haste said, and like as the body is fashioned now in the chyldesbed, and thou
gyuest the members, and thy creature is preserved in fire and water: and.ix.
months does thy work suffer thy creature, which is fashioned in her but
the thing that preserves and it that is preserved, shall both be kept
together: and when time is, the chyldeshed delyuereth the thing, that is kept
and grown in her.

For thou have commanded the breasts to milk unto the fruit, yt the thing
which give is created and fashioned, may be norished for a time: and than thou
dysposest and ordrest it with thy mercy, bryngest it up with thy ryghtousnes,
nurturest it in thy law, and reformest it with thy understanding, mortifyest
it it as thy creature, and makeh it living

And this I speak now of all men in general, as thou know: but of thy
people, for whose sake I am sorry: and of thy inheritance: for whose cause I
mourn, and of Israel, for whom I am woeful: and for Jacob, for whose sake I
am grieved: therefore begin I to pray before the, for my self and for them,
for I se the fall of us, even of us, ye dwell upon earth. But I have herd the
swyftnes of the judge, which is to come: therefore hear my voice, and
understand my words, and I shall speak before the.

This is the beginning of the words of Esdras, before he was received: O
Lord, thou that dwell in euerlastyngnes, whose eyes are lift up in the
air, whose stole is exceeding hye, whose glory and majesty may not be
comprehended, before whom the Hosts of heaven stand with tremblyng, whose
keeping is turned in wind and fire, whose word is true, whose talki^g is
steadfast, whose commandment is strong, whose ordinance is fearful, whose
look dries up the depthes, whose wrath makes the mountains to melt away,
and whose truth bears wytnes: O hear the prayer of thy servant, and mark
with thine ears the peticyon of thy creature.

For while I live, I will speak, and so long as I have understanding, I will
answer. O look not upon the sins of thy people, which serve in the truth.
Have no respect unto the wicked studyes of the heithen, but to the desire of
those that keep thy testimonies with sorrows. Thynk not upon those that have
walked faynedly before the, but upon them, which with will have known thy fear.

Let it not be thy will to destroy the^ which have had beastly manners, but to
look upon them that have clearly taught thy law. Take thou no indignacion at
them, which are worse then beasts: but love them, that always put their trust
in thy ryghtousnesse and glory: for we and our fathers have all the same
sycknes and disease but because of our sins thou shalt be called merciful.

iii. Reg.viii. g ii. Pa.vi. f i. John^.i. b
where as we have no works of rightousnes: for the rightous which have laid
up many good works together shall out of their deeds receive reward. For what
is man, that thou should take displeasure at him? Or what is the corruptyble
mortal generation, that thou should be so rough toward him?

For of a truth there is no man among the^ that be borne, but he has dealte
wyckedly: and among the faithful there is none, which has not done amiss.
For i^ this (O Lord thy ryghtousnesse and thy goodness shall be praised and
declared, if thou be merciful unto them, which are not rych in good works.

Then answered he me and said: Some things have thou spoken a right, and
according unto thy word it shall be. For I will not verily consydre the
works of the, which have sinned before death, before the judgment, before
destruction, but I will rejoice over the work and thought of the ryghtous. I
will remember also the pylgremage the holy making and the reward. Like as I
have spoken now so shall it come to pass. For as the husband man sows
much sede upon the ground, and planteth many trees, and yet always the
thing that is sown or planted is not al kept safe, neither does it al take
rote: Even so is it of them that are sown in the world, they shall not all be
preserved.

I answered then and said: If I have found grace, then let me speak. Like as
the husband man's sede peryssheth, if it receive not rain in due season, or if
there come to much rain upon it: Even so peryssheth man also, which is
created with thy hands, and is like unto thine own Image and to thy self, for
whose sake thou have made all things, and lykened him unto the husband man's
sede. Be not wrath at us, O Lord, but spare thy people, and have mercy upon
thine own inheritance: O be merciful unto thy creature.

Then answered be me and said: Things

But understand thou for thy self, and seek out glory for such as be like
the: for unto you is paradyse opened, the tree of life is planted, the time to
come is prepared, plenteousnes made ready: a city is builded for you, and a
rest is prepared, yea perfect goodness and wisdom. The rote of evil is
marcked from you, the weakness and much is hyd from you, and into hell flies
corrupcion in forgetfulness. Sorrows are vanyshed away, and in the end is
showed the treasure of immortalyte. And therefore ask thou no more questions,
concerning the multitude of them that perysh. For they have taken liberty,
despised the highest, thought scorn of his law, and forsaken his ways.

Moreover, they have trodden down his ryghtous, and said in their heart, that
there is no God, yea and that wyttyngly, for they dye. For like as the thing
that I have spoken of, is made ready for you: Even so is thirst and pain
prepared for them. For it was not his will that man should come to naught:
(...) xiii. a
but they which be created, have defiled the name of him that made them, and
are vntha^ckfull unto him, which prepared life for them. And therefore is my
judgment now at hand. These things have I not showed unto all men, but unto
few: namely unto the, and such as be like the.

Then answered I and said: Behold O Lord, now have thou showed me the
multitude of the tokens, which thou wylt begin to do at the last: but at what
time and wha^ thou have not showed me.

Esdras has vysyons showed unto him.

CAPI. IX.
HE answered me then and said: Measure

And when there shall be seen earthquake and uproar of the people in the
world, then shall thou well understand, that the most highest spoke of those
things, from the days that were before the, even from ye beginning.

For like as all that is made in the world, has a beginning and end, and the
end is manifest: Eue^ so the times also of ye highest have plain begynnynges
in wondres and signs, and the end in workynge and in tokens. And every one
that shall be saved, and shall be hable to escape by his worckes and by faith,
wherein ye have believed, shall be preserved from the said parels, and shall se
my savior in my land and within my borders, for I have hallowed me from the
world. Then shall they be in carfulness, which now have abused my ways: and
they that have cast them out despytefully, shall dwell in pains.

For such as in their life have receued benefytes, and have not known me, and
they that have abhorred my law, while they had yet fredome, and when they had
yet open rowme of amendment and conuersyon, and understood not: but despised
it: the same must know it after death in pain. And therefore be thou no more
careful: how the ungodly shall be punished, and how the ryghtous shall be
saved, and whose the world is, and for who^ the world, (...) vii. a
and when it is. Then answered I and said: I have talked before, and now I
speak, and will speak also hereafter, that there be many mo of them which
perysshe, then shall be saved, like as the flood is greater then the drops.



Nevertheless if thou wylt take upon the yet seven days mo (but thou shalt
not fast in them) go thy way then in to the field of flowers, where no house
is builded, and eat only of the flowers of the field, taste not flesh, drink
no wine, but eat flowers only. Pray unto the highest contynually, so will I
come, and talk with the.

So I went my way, and came in to the Exodusxix. d xxiiii. a. Deuteronomy.iiii. b
and thou spakest, saying: Hear me O Israel, and mark my words thou sede of
Jacob. Behold, I saw my law in you, and it shall bring fruit in you, and ye
shall be honored in it for ever. For our fathers which received the law,
kept not, and observed not thy ordinances and statutes, and the fruit of thy
law was not declared: for it might not, for why? it was thine. Exodusxxxii. f
For they that received it perysshed, because they kept not the thing that
was sown in them.

It is a custom when the ground receives seed, or the sea a ship, or a
vessel meat and drink, that when it peryssheth or is broken, wherein a thing
is sown, or wherein any thing is put: the things also perysshe and are broken,
which are sown or put therein. But unto us it has not happened so: for we that
have received the law, perish in sin, Esaias.xi. a ii. Timot.ii. a
and our heart which also received the law: notwithstanding the law peryssheth
not, but remains in his labor.

And when I considered these things in ^y heart after this manner, I looked
about me iiii. Esdra.x. d
I (...) woman, which mourned sore, made great lamentacion, and wept with
loud voice: her clothes were rent in pieces, and she had ashes upon her head.

Then let I my thoughts go, yt I was in, and turned me unto her, and said:
wherefore wepest you? why art thou so sorry and discomforted? And she said unto
me: Sir, let me bewail my self and take yet more sorrow: for I am sore vexed
in my mind, and brought very low. And I said unto her: what ayleth the? Or
who has done any thing to y^? tell me. She said: I have been unfruitfully and
baren, and have had an husband thyrty years. And these thirty years I do
nothing else day and night and al hours, but make my prayer to the highest,
After thyrtye years God herd me thy handmayden, looked upon my mysery,
consydred my trouble, and gave me a son, and I was glad of him, so was my
husband also, and all my neighbors and we gave great honor unto the
mighty. And I norysshed him with great travail. So when he grew up, and came to
the time that he should have a wife, I made a feast.

Esdras and the woman that appears unto him common together.

CAPI. X.


Then let I my meditacions and thoughts fall, that I was in, and spoke to her
in displeasure: Thou folysshe woman, seist thou not our heaviness and
mourning, and what happens unto us? how Sion our mother is al woeful and
sorye, and how she is clean brought down and in myserye? seeing we be all
now in heaviness, and make our moan (for we be all sorrowful) As for the
heaviness that thou take, it is but for one son. Demand the earth, and she
shall tell the yt it is she which ought (by reason) to mourn for the fall of
so many that grow upon her.

For from the beginning al men are borne of her, and other shall come: and
behold, they walk al most all in to destruction, and many of them shall be
roted out

Who should then (by reason) make more mournyge, then she, that has lost so
great a multitude? and not thou, which art sorry but for one. But if thou
would say unto me: My mourning is not like the mournyng of the earth, for I
have lost the fruit of my body, which I bear with heuines: but the earth is
according to the manner of the earth, and the present multitude goes again
into her, as it is come to pass: Then say I unto the: like as thou have borne
with travail and sorrow, even so the earth also from the beginning gives her
fruit unto man, for him yt made her. Hebr.xii* ^
And therefore withholde thy sorrow and heaviness by thy self, and look what
happens unto the, bear it stronglye. For if thou iudgest the marcke and end
of God to be ryghtous and good, and receyuest his council in time, thou shalt
be commended therein. Go thy way then into the cyty to thy husband.

And she said unto me: that will not do, I will not go into the cyty, but hear
will I dye So I co^moned more with her, and said: Do not so, but be counseled,
and follow me: for how many falls has Sion? Be of good comfort because of
the sorrow of Jerusalem. For thou seist that our Sanctuary is laid waste our
altar broken, our temple destroyed, our playinge of instruments and synginge
laid down, the thanckesgeuyuynge put to silence, our myrthe is vanyshed
away the light of our candelstycke is quenched, ye arck of the couenaunte is
taken from us, all our holy things are defiled, and the name that is called
upon over us, is dishoured: our children are put to shame our prestes are
burnt, our Levites are carried away in to captyuytye, our vyrgyns are
defiled, and our wives rauisshed, our ryghtous men spoiled, and our children
destroyed, our young me^ are brought in bondage, and our strong worthyes are
become weak: and Sion (which seal is the greatest of all) is loosed up from
her worship for she is delivered into the hands of them that hate us.

And therefore shake of thy great heaviness,

Then was I afraid, iiii. Esd.ii^ ^
and cried with loud voice, and said where is Vryel the aungel, which came to
me at the first? For he has caused me to come in many consideracions and
high thoughts, and mine end is turned to corrupcion, and my prayer to rebuke.
And as I was speakinge these words, he came unto me, and looked upon me, and I
lay as one that had been deed, and mine understanding was aultered, and he
took me by the right hand and comforted me, and set me up upon my fete, and
said unto me: what ayleth the? and why is thine understanding vexed? and ye
understanding of thy heart, and wherefore art thou sorye? And I said: Because
thou have forsaken me, and I have done according unto thy words, I went in to
the feld, and there have I seen things, ^ ^sdr.ix. a
that I am not hable to express. He said unto me: Stand up, and be manly, and
I shall give the exhortacion.

Then said I: Speak on to me my Lord, forsake me not, lest I die in vayn: for
I have seen that I knew not, and herd that I do not know. Or shall my
understanding be disceyued, and my mind? But now I beseech the, that you wilt
show thy servant of this wondre. He answered me then and said: hear me and I
shall inform the, and tell the wherefore you art afraid; ^r the hiest has opened
many secret things unto the.

He has seen that thy way is right, and that thou take sorrow continually for
thy people and make great lamentacion for Sio^, and therefore understand the
vision which thou saw a little while agoo after this manner: Thou saw a
woman mourning, and thou have comforted her. Nevertheless now seist you the
likeness of the woman no more, but thou thoughtest there was a city builded: and
like as she told the of the fall of her son, so is this the answer: the
woman whom you saw is Sion, and where as she told the that she has been.xxx.
years vnfrutful and baren, those are the.xxx. years, wherein there was no
offering made in her.



And therefore I badde the remain in the feld, where no house is builded. For I
knew that the highest would show this unto the, therefore I commanded the to
goo in to the field, where no foundacyon nor building is. For in the place
where the highest will show his city, there shall be no man's building. And
therefore fear not, and let not thy heart be afraid, but goo thy way in, and
se the glorious and fair building, and how great it is, and how great
thou thynkest it after the measure of thine eyes, and then shalt thou hear as
much as thine ears may comprehend. For thou art blessed above many other,
and art called with the highest, as the few. But to morrow at night thou shall
remain here, and so shall the hiest show the visions of hye things, which he
will do unto them that dwell upon earth in the last days, so I slepte the same
night like as he commanded me.

In this chapter and in the two next ensuing, he entreats of certain visions
and of the interpretacions thereof.

CAPI. XI.
THen saw I a dreme: and behold, there

Moreover I saw, that the Egle flew with his wings, and reigned upon earth, and
over all them that dwell upon the earth: and I saw yt all things under heaven
were subject unto him, and no man spoke against him no not one creature upon
earth. I saw also that the Egle stood up upon his claws, and gave a sound with
is feathers, and a voice, saying after this manner: watch not all together,
sleep every man in his own place, and watch for a time, but let the heedes be
preserved at the last. Nevertheless I saw that ye voice went not out of his
heedes, but from the myddest of his body. And I nombred his contrary feathers,
and behold there were eight of them. And I looked, and behold upon the right
side there arose one fether, and reigned over all the earth. And it happened yt
when it reigned, the end of it came, and the place thereof appeared no more. So
ye next following stood and reigned and had a great time: and it happened, that

Then came there a voice unto it, and said: Hear thou that haste kept in the
earth so long, this I say unto the before thou begynnest to appear no more.
There shall none after the, attain unto thy time. Then arose the third, and
raygned as the other before, and appeared no more also. So went it with all the
resydue one after an other, so that every one raygned, and then appeared no
more. Then I looked, and behold, in process of time the feathers that followed,
were set up upon the right side, that they might rule also: and some of them
ruled, but within a while they appeared no more: for some of them were set up,
but ruled not.

After this I looked, and behold the twelve feathers appeared no more, and ye two
wings: and there was no more upon the Egles body, but two heedes that rested,
and six feathers. Then saw I also that the six feathers were parted in two,
and remained under the heed that was upon the right side, for the four
continued in their place. So I looked, and heholde, they that were under the
wings thought to was in the midst, for that was the greater of the two
heedes. And then I saw that the two heedes were filled with him, and ye heed
was turned with them that were by him, and ate up the two under wings yt
would have reigned.

But this heed put the hole earth in fear, and bare rule in it, over all those
that dwelt upon earth with much labor, and he had the governance of the world,
over all the fowls that have been. After this I looked, and behold, the heed yt
was in the midst, suddenly appeared no more, like as the wings: then came the
two heedes, which ruled upon earth, and over those dwelt therein. And I beheld,
and lo, the

And the fourth came, and ouerwan all the beestes that were paste, and had power
over the world with great fearfulness, and over the hole compass of the earth
with the most wicked labor, and so long time dwelt he upon the earth with
disceyte, and the earth have thou judged not with truth. For thou haste troubled
the meke t^ou have hurt the peaceable and quiet, thou (...) loved liars, and
destroyed the dwellynges of them that brought forth fruit, and have cast down
the walls of such as did the no harm. Therefore is thy wrongous dealyng and
blasphemye come up unto the highest, and thy pride unto ye mighty. The highest also
has looked upon the proud times, and behold, they are ended, and their
abhominacio^s are fulfilled. And therefore appear no more thou Egle, and thy
horrible wings and thy wicked feathers, and thy ungracious heads, and thy
sinful claws, and all thy vain body: that the earth may be refresshed, and
come again to her self, when she is delivered from thy vyolence, and yt she
may hope for the judgment and mercy of him that made her.

CAPI. XII.


And he said unto me: this is the interpretacion of this sight. The Egle whom
thou saw come up from the sea, is the kingdom which was seen in the vision
of thy brother Daniel, Danie.vii. f
but it was not expounded unto him for now I declare it unto the. Behold, the

And where as thou saw three heedes restyng,

And where as thou saw two vnderwinges upon the head that is on the right
side, it sygnifyeth that it is they, whom the highest has kept unto their
end: this is a small kyndgom, and full of trouble. The lion whom thou saw
rysynge up out of the wod, and rorynge and speaking unto the Egle, and
rebukynge him for his vnryghtousnesse, is the wind, which the highest has
kept for them and for their wickedness unto the end: he shall reprove them,
and rent them asunder before them. For he shall set them living before the
judgment, and shall rebuke them: for the resydue of my people shall he deliver
with trouble, those that be preserved over mine ends: and he shall make the^
joyful, until the coming of the day of judgment, whereof I have spoken unto
the from the beginning. This is the dream that thou saw, and this is the
interpretacion. Thou only have been mete to know the secret of the highest.

Therefore write all these things that thou haste seen in a book, and hyde
them, and teach them the wise in ye people, whose hertes thou know, may
comprehend and keep

And when all the people perceived, that ye seven days were past, and I not
come again in to the city, they gathered them al together from the leest unto
the most, and came unto me, and said: what have we offended the? and what evil
have we done against the, that you forsakest us, and sit here i^ this place?
for of all people thou only art left us as a grape of the vine, and as a candle
in a dark place, and as an haue^ and ship preserved from the tempest. Have we
not else adversity enough, but thou must forsake us? Were it not better for
us, that we had been brent with Sion. For we are no better then they yt dyed
there: and they wept with loud voice. Then answered I them and said: Be of
good comfort, O Israel, and be not heavy thou house of Jacob, for the highest
has you in remembrance, and the mighty has not forgotten you in temptacion.
As for me, I have not forsaken you, neither am I departed from you: but am come
in to this place to pray, because of the myserye of Israel, that I might seek
mercy for the low estate of your Sanctuarye. And now goo your way home
every man, and after these days will I come unto you. So the people went
their way in to the city, like as I commanded them: but I remained still in
the feldes seven days, as the angel badde me: and I ate only of the flowers
of the field, and had my meat of the herbs in those days.

CAPI. XIII.
ANd it happened after the seven days,

After these I saw, and behold, there was gathered together a multitude of
men out of nombre from the four wyndes of the heaven, to fight against the man
that came out from the sea. And I looked, and behold, he graued him self a
great mountain, and flewe up upon it. But I would have seen the border or
place, whereout the hill was graven, and I could not.

I saw after these, that all they which came to fight against him, were
sore afraid, and yet durst they fight. Nevertheless, when he saw the
fearcenesse and vyolence of the people, he neither lift up his hand, ne held
sword nor any weapen: but only (as I saw) he sent out of his mouth as it
had been a blast of fire, and out of his lyppes the wind of the flambe: and out
of his tongue he cast out sparks and storms, and they were all myxte
together the blaste of fire, the wind of the flambes, and the great storm,
and fell with a russhe upon the people which was prepared to fight, and brent
them up every chone: so that of the innumerable multitude there was nothing
seen, but only duste and smoke. When I saw this, I was afraid.

Afterward saw I the same man come down from the mountain, and calling

Then was I sick through great fear, and I awaked, and said: thou haste
showed thy servant al thy wonders from the beginnynge, and haste counted me
worthy, that you myghtest receive my prayer: show me now yet the
interpretacyon of this dream. For thus I consydre in my understanding: Woe unto
them that shall be left in those days: and much more woo unto them that are
not left behind: for they that were not left, were in heaviness.

Now understand I the things that are laid up in the latter days, which
shall happen unto them, and to those that are not left behind. Therefore are
they come in to great perils, and many necessities, like as these dreams
declare. Yet is it easyer, that he which suffers hurt, come in these, then
to pass away as a cloud out of the world, and now to se the things that
shall happen in the last.

Then answered he me, and said: The interpretacion of the syghte shall I show
the, and I will open unto the, the thing that thou have required. For thou haste
spoken of them that are left behind, and this is the interpretacion. He that
takes away the peril in that time has kept him self. They that be fallen
in to harm, are such as have wo^kes and faith unto the most mighty. Know
this therefore, that they which be left behind are more blessed then they that
be deed. This is the meaning of ye visyon. Where as thou saw a man coming
up from the deep of the sea, the same is he which God the highest has kept a
great season, whom by his own self shall deliver his creature, and he shall
order them that be left behynd. And where as thou saw, that out of his
mouth there came a blast of wind, fire, and storm, and how that he lift up
neither sword nor weapon, but that the russhyng in of him destroyed ye hole
multitude that came to fight against him: it signifies, that the days come,
when God will deliver them that are upon earth, and Math.xiiii. a
one place against an other, one people against an other, and one realm
against an other. When this comes to pass then shall the tokens come that I
showed the before, and then shall my son be declared, whom thou saw clyme
up as a man. And when all the people hear his voice, every man shall in their
own land leave the battle that they have one against an other, and an
innumerable multitude shall be gathered together, as they yt be willing to
come and to ouercom him by fyghtyng. But he shall stand upon the top of the
mount Syon. Nevertheless Sion shall come, and shall be showed, being prepared
and builded for all men, like as thou saw the hyl graven forth without any
hands. But my son shall rebuke ye people that are come for their wickedness,
with the tempest, and for their evil ymagynacyons: and their pains wherewith
they shall be punysshed, are lykened unto ye flambe, and without any labor
shall he destroy them, even by the law, which is compared unto the fire.

And where as thou saw, that he gathered an other peaceable people unto him:
those are the ten tribes which are carried away prisoners out of their own land,
in the time of Oseas the king, whom Salmanasar the king of Assiria took
prisoner and carried them over the water, and so came they in to an other land.

But they gave them this counsel, that they should leave the multitude of the
Heathen, and to go forth in to a farther country, where never mankind dwelt:
that they might there keep their statutes, which they never kept in their own
land, and so they entered in at the Exodusxiiii. e Iosue.iii. d
and held still the flood till they were passed over: for through that country
there was a great way namely of a year and a half journey, for the same region
is called Asareth.

Then dwelt they there unto ye latter time: and when they come forth again,
the highest shall hold still the sprynges of the stream again, that they may
go through, therefore saw thou the multitude with peaxe. And they that be
left behind of thy people, are those that be found with in my border. Now
when he destroys the multitude that is gathered together, he shall defend
his people ye remain, and then shall he show them great wonders.

Then said I: O Lord Lord, show me this, wherefore have I seen the man
coming up from the deep of the sea? And he said unto me: like as thou can
neither seek out nor know these things that are in the deep of ye see, even so
may thou not se my son, or those that he with him, but in the time of the
day. This is the interpretacion of the dreme which thou saw, therefore thou
only art here lightened: for thou have forsaken thine own law, and applied
thy diligence unto mine, and sought it. iii. Regu^.iii Prouer.v.i. ^
Thy life haste thou ordered in wysdom, and have called understanding thy
mother, and therefore have I showed the, the treasure of the highest. After three
days I will show the more, and talk with the at more large, yea heavy and
wondrous things will I declare unto the.

Then went I forth in to the field, gyuyng praise and thanks greatly unto
God because of his wonders which he did in time, and because he governs the
same, and such as is in time, and there I sat three days.

God appears unto Esdras in the busshe, and shows him what he shall do.

CAPI. XIIII.
Upon the third day I sat under an oak Exodusiii. ^
when my people served in Egypt and I sent him, and led my people out of Egypt,
and brought him upon the mount Syo^ where I held him by me a long season, and
told him my wondrous works, and showed him the secrets of the times and the
end, and commanded him, saying: these words shall thou declare, and not hyde
them.

And now I say unto the, that thou lay up in thine heart, the dremes that
thou haste seen, and the interpretacions which I have showed the: for thou
shall be received of al, thou shall be turned, and remain with my counsel,
and with such as he like the, until the times be ended. For the world has
lost his youth, and the times begin to ware old. For the time is divided in to
twelve parts, and ten parts of it are gone alredye, and half of the tenthe
part: yet remains there that, which is after the half of the tenth part.

Therefore prepare and order thy house, and refourme thy people: comfort such
of them away the burdens of man, put of the weyke nature: lay up in some
places the thoughts that are most heavy unto the, and haste ye to flyt from
these times: for such evil and wickedness as thou have now seen happen,
shall they do yet much worse. (...).xxiiii. a (...).c
For the weaker that the world and the time is, ye more shall sin and
wickedness increase, in them that dwell upon earth. For the truth is fled
far away, and lesynge is hard at hand. For now hastes the vision to come,
yt thou have seen.

Then answered I and said: Behold Lord, I will go as thou have commanded
me, and refourme the people which are present. But they that shall be borne
afterward who will exhort or rebuke them? Thus the world is set in
darkness, and they that dwell therein are without light: for thy law is
kyndled, because no man knows ye things that are done in the, or that shall
be done. If I have found grace before the, send the holy ghost in to me, and
I shall write all that has been done in the world sense the beginning,
which was written in thy law, that men may find the pathe, and that they
which will live in the latter days, may live.



Then went I forth (as he commanded me) and gathered all the people together,
and said: Hear these words, O Israel: Our fathers from the beginning were
strangers in Egypt, (...) ^ii. b.
from whence they were delivered, and received, the law of life, which they
kept not, which ye also have transgressed after them. Then was this land and
the land of Syon parted among you by lot to possess. But your fathers and ye
your selves also have done vnryghtousnesse, and have not kept the ways
which the highest commanded you. And for so much as he is a rightous judge,
he took from you in time the thing that he had given you. And now are ye
here, and your brethren among you. Therefore if so be that ye will subdue your
own understanding, and refourme your heart, ye shall be kept alive, and
after death shall ye obtain mercy. For after death shall the judgment
come, when we shall live again: and then shall the names of the rightous be
manifest, and the names of the ungodly with their worckes, shall be declared.
Let no man therefore come now unto me, ne ask any questyon of me these
forty days.

So I took the five men (as he commanded Ezech.iii. a Apoca.x. ^
Then opened I my mouth, and behold he reached me a full cup which was full
of water, but the color of it was like fire. And I took it and drank. And
when I hand dronken it, my heart had understanding, and wisdom grew in my
breast: for my spirit was kept in remembrance, and my mouth was opened, and
should no more. The highest gave understanding unto the five men. that they wrote
the hye things of the night, which they understood not. But in the night they
ate breed: as for me, I spoke in the day, and held my tongue by night. In forty
days they wrote two hundred and four books.

And it happened when the fortye days were fulfilled, that the highest spoke,
saying: The first that thou have written, speak openly, that the worthy and
unworthy may read it. But the three score and ten last, that thou may show
it only to such as be wise among thy people. For in them is the spring of
understanding, the fountain of wisdom, and the streme of knowledge. And I did
so.

to show unto them.

Therefore says the Lord: I will hold my tongue no more unto their
wickedness, which they do so ungodly: neither will I suffer them in the
things that they deal withal so wyckedly.

the innocent blood of the troubled cries unto me, and the souls of ye
rightous complain contynually: and therefore (says the Lord) I will surely
avenge, and receive unto me all the innocent blood from among them.

Behold, my people is led as a flok of sheep to be slain, Psalm.lxiii.c
^^ma.viii.c i. Corin.iiii. b
I will not suffer them now to dwell in Egypt, but will bring them out with
a mighty hand, and a stretched out arm, and smite it with plages as before, and
will destroy all the land of it. Egypt shall mourn and the foundacions of it
shall be smitten with the plage and punishment yt God shall bring upon it.







And then shall the Dragons have the upper hand, not remembrynge their birth,
and shall turn about swearynge together in great power, to persecute them.
But these shall be afraid, and keep silence at their power, and shall flee:

of them, and in their host shall be fear and dread, and strife among their
kings.

And then shall there come great raynes from the Southe, and from the North,
and part from the weste, and from the stormye wind from the East, and

sterre to cause fear toward the East and west wind, shall be destroyed: and
the great clouds shall be lift up, and the mighty clouds full of wrath, and
the sterre, that they may make all the earth afraid, and them that dwell
therein, and that they may pour out over all places an horrible sterre, fire
and hayle, and fleing swerdes, and many waters: that all feldes may be full,
and all ryuers, and they that break down the cities and walls, mountains
and hills, all trees, wod, and the grass of the meadows, and all their fruit.
And they shall goo steadfast unto Babylon, and make her afraid, they shall come

Therefore says God: I will send plages upon the, widowhod, poverty, honger,
wars, and pestylence, to waste thy houses with destruction and death, and the
glory of thy power shall be dried up as a flower, when the heat arises that is
sent over the. Thou shall be sick as a poor wife that is plaged and beaten of
women: so that the mighty and lover shall not be hable to receive the. Wold^ I
so hate the, says the Lord, If thou had not always slain my chosen,
exalting the stroke of thy hands, and said over their death, when thou wast
dronken: set forth the beauty of thy countenunce.

The reward of thy hoordome shall be recompensed in thy bosom, therefore shall
thou be reacquited.

Like as thou haste done unto my chosen (says the Lord) even so shall God do
unto the, and shall deliver the into the plage. Thy children shall dye of
honger, and thou shall fall through the sword. Thy cities shall be broken down:
and al thine shall perysshe with the sword in the field. They that be in the
mountains shall dye of honger, and eat their own flesh, and drink their own
blood for very honger of bred and thyrste of water. Thou unhappy shalt come
through the sea and receive plages again.

In the passage they shall cast down the slain city, and shall rote out one
part of thy land, and consume the portion of thy glory. They shall tread the
down like stubble, and they shall be the fire and shall consume the: thy
cytyes and thy land, thy wod and thy frutfull trees shall they burn up with ye
fire. Thy children shall they carry away captyue, and look what thou have, they
shall spoil it, and mar the beawtye of thy face.

The heithen shall be punisshed.

word has he hanged the earth upon the waters. He spredeth out the heaven like
a vawte, upon the waters has he founded it. In the deserte and dry wyldernes
has he made sprynges of water, and poles upon the top of the mountains,
that the floudes might pour down from the stony rocks to water the earth. He
made man, and put his heart in the myddest of the body, and gave him breath,

Though he was taken prisoner in ye days of Salmanasar king of the Assirians,

But when he was a man, he took out of his own trybe a wife called Anna, and

Now when he with his wife, his son and with all his kindred was come in
captyuitie unto Niniue, (...)
what time as they al ate of the meats of the heithen, he kept his soul, and
was never defiled in their meats. And for so much as he was myndfull of the

king which gave him power to go where he would, and so had he lybertye to
do what him list.

After a long season when Salmanasar the king was deed, and Sennacherib his
son ragned in his stead, which hated the children of Israel. Tobias went
daily through out all his kynred, and comforted them, and gave of his goods to
every one of them as much as he might: he fed the hungrye, clothed the naked,
and buried ye deed and slain. iiii. Reg.xix.g
and that diligently.

And when Sennacherib the king came again and fled out of Iewry (what time as
God punysshed him for his blasphemy) and in his wrath, slew many of the
children of Israel. Tobias buried their bodies. iiii. Esdr.ii.c
But when it was told the king, he commanded to slaye him, and took away all
his goods. Nevertheless Tobias with his son and with his wife, fled his
way, and was hyd naked, for there were many that loved him. But after.xlv.
days, the king was slain of his own sons. Then came Tobias again to his
house, and all his goods restored unto him.

Tobias byddeth such of his friends as fear God, to a banquet or feast. He is
reproved of his friends. He fears God more then the king. He becomes
blind, by the permyssyon and sufferaunce of God. His kynsfolckes mock him.

they which came after, might have an example of his patience, like as of holy

commandments, he was not heuye against God, that ye plage of blyndnes
chaunsed unto him but remained steadfast in ye fear of God, and thanked God all
the days of his life.

THen answered Tobias his father, and said: father all that thou have
commanded me, will I do, and that dylyge^tly. But how I shall require this money
I ca^ not tell. Neither does he know me, ne I him. What token shall I give him?
And as for ye way thither, I never knew it. Then his father answered him, and
said: I have his hand writing by me, which when thou show him, immediatlye
he shall pay the. But go thy way now, and get the some faithful man to go

Then went Tobias out, and upon the street, he found a fair young man
standing, gyrded up, and as it were one ready to take his journey. And he
knew not that it was an Angel of God, but saluted him, and said: From whence
art thou, thou good young man? He answered: Of the children of Israel.

trust, that the good Angel of God shall bear him company, and order well all
the things that he does: so that he shall come to us again with joy. At

The angel answered and said here is a nygh kynsman of thine, one Raguel by
name, which has a daughter called Sara, and has neither son ne daughter but
her. All his good belongs unto yt, and thou must mary his daughter: and
therefore desire her of her father, and he shall give her the to wife. Then
answered Tobias and said: As I understand, she has been married unto seven
husbands, and they al are deed: and I have herd say, that the devil slew
them. I am afraid therefore, lest such things happen unto me also: which if it
came to pass (s^ynge I am the only son of my father and my mother) I
should bring them in their age with sorrow to their graves.

And immediately Raguel commanded his servants to fill the grave yt they had
made with earth before it was light: and bade his wife prepare a feast, and to
make ready al things that were necessary for meat, to such as went by the
way. He caused two fat kyne also, and four wethers to he slain, and meats
to be prepaeer for all his neighbors and friends, and Raguel charged Tobias to

Then Tobias comforted her, and said: hold thy tongue, and be not discomforted,
our son is hole and sound: the man that we sent him withal is faithful
enough. Nevertheless she might in no wise be comforted: but daily went out,
looked about, and went about all the streets, whereby she thought he should com

So when Raguel prayed Tobias with many words, and would in no wise hear

Now when they had worshipped and thanked God, they sat down. Then took Tobias
of the fisshes gall, and anointed his fathers eyes: and tarried half an hour,
and then began the blemyssh to go out of his eyes, like as it had been the white
skyn of an egg, which Tobias took and drew from his eyes, and immediately he
received his sight.

Then they praised god, he and his wife, and al they that knew him. And Tobias
said: O Lord God of Israel, I give the praise and thanks, for thou haste
chastened me, and made me hole. And lo, now do I se my son Tobias. After seven
days came Sara his sons wife also hole and sound, with all the household and
catell, with camels and much money of his wives, and with ye money that he had
received of Gabelus: and he told his father and mother all the benefytes, which
God had done for him, by the man that led him. Achior also and Nabath Tobias
systers sons came, and were glad, and reioysed with him, by reason of all the
good, that God had showed unto him. And so for ye space of seven days they
made merye, and were right joyful every chone.

their faces unto the ground. Then said the aungel:

You thought that I did eat and drink with you, but I use meat that is

and drink that can not be seen of men.

Now therefore is the time yt I must turn again unto him yt sent me: but be

And when he had spoken these words, he was taken away out of their

told all his wondrous works.

and the plage ceased, and then followed after them, to take them, and to bring

Now when Achior had spoken out these words, all the princes of Holofernes
were wroth and thought to slay him, and said one to an other: what is he

without strength or understanding of the feats of war? That Achior therefore
may know that he has dysceyued us, we will go up in to the mountains: and
when the mighty men of them are taken, he also shall be styckt with the
sword, that all people may know, that Nabuchodonosor is the God of the earth,

So Holofernes commanded his servants to take Achior, and to carry him unto
Bethulia, and to deliver him into the hands of the children of Israel. Then
Holofernes servants took him, and went through the plain field. But when
they drew nigh unto the mountains, the slynge casters came out against them.
Nevertheless they gat them away by the side of the mountain, and bound
Achior hand and foot to a tree, and so left him bound with withyes, and
turned again unto their Lord.

Notwithstanding the children of Israel went down from Bethulia, came unto
him, loosed him, brought him in to Bethulia, set him in the mydest of the
people, and asked him what the matter was, that the Assyrians had left him
bound.

Osias the son of Micha, of the trybe of Iudi.v. b
what answer he gave Holofernes, to the thing that he asked him, and how
Holofernes people would have slain him for so saying: and how Holofernes him
self was wrath, and commanded him for the same cause to be delivered unto the
Israelites: that when he overcame the children of Israel, he might command
Achior also to be put to death with diverse torments, because he said: the God
of heaven is their defender. And when Achior had plainly told out al these
things, Judith.v. f
all the people fell down upon their faces, praisyng the Lord, and poured out
their prayers together unto ye Lord, with a general complaynt and weeping, and
said: O Lord of heaven and of earth, behold their pride, and look upon our
lowlynesse, and consydre how it stands with thy saints, and make it to be
known that thou forsakest not those, which hold them fast by the, and how
that thou bryngest them low, that presume of them selves, and make their boost
in their own strength.



Now when Osias had ended the counsel, he took him into his house, and made a
great supper, called the elders to it, and so they refresshed them selves after
the fasting. And afterward was all the people called together, which made
their prayers all the night long in the congregacyon, and besought ye God of
Israel for help.

brought down before their eyes in thyrst and great destruction.

Therefore gather now together all the people that be in the city, that we may
al yield our selves wylyngly unto the people of Holofernes: for better it is
that we be captive and praise the Lord with our lives, then to be slain and
perysshe, and to be laughed to scorn and shamed of every man, when we se our
wives and children dye before our eyes. We take heaven and earth this day to

deseruynge of our sins) and give you warning, that ye give up the city
now in to the power of Holofernes hooste, that our end may be short with

For while he was byndynge the sheues together in the field, the heat came
upon his heed, and he dyed at Bethula his city, and there was he buried beside
his fathers. Now

When this Judith herd, Judith.vii. e
how Osias had promised the people, that after the fifth day he would give up
the city unto the Assiria^s she sent for the elders Chambri and Charmin and
when they came to her she said: what thing is this, wherein Osias has
consented that if God help not within five days, he will give over the city
to the Assirians? What are ye, that ye tempt the Lord? This device optayneth
no mercy of God, but provoke him unto wrath and displeasure. Will ye set the
mercy of the Lord a time and appoynte him a day after your will?

Nevertheless for so much as the Lord is Ierem.xviii. ^ and.xxv. a
neither will he be provoked unto wrath as the children of men. And therefore
let us hertely fall down before him, and serve him with a meke spyryte, and
with weeping eyes say unto the Lord, that he deal with us according to his
own will and mercy: that like as our heart is now vexed, and brought low
through the pride of them, it may so be comforted through his grace: in so much
as we follow not the sins of our fathers, which forsook their God, and
worshypped other gods: Judith.ii. b ii^i. a.vi. a
for the which sin they peryshed with the sword: were spoiled and brought
to shame of all their enemies. As for us, we know none other God but only
him, for whose comfort let us tarry with mekenes. He shall require and make
inquysycion for our blood, Deute.xxxii.c
from the vexacions of our enemies: he shall bring down all the Heithe^ that
rise up against us, and put them to dishonor, even the Lord our God.

Therefore dear brethren, seeing ye are ye honorable and elders in the people
of God, unto whom all the people have respect, and upon whom the life of the
people stands, Deute.viii. a ii. Par.xxxii. f
lift up their hertes with your exhortacion that they may call to
reme^mbrau^ce, how our fathers also in times past were temted, that they might
be proved, if they worshypped their God a right. They ought to remember, how
our father Abraham being temted, Gene.xvii. a and.xxii. a Gene.xxviii. b
Prouer.iii. b Hebr.xii. ^
and tried through many trybulacions, was found a lover and friend of God. So
was Isaac, so was Jacob, so was Moses, and all they that pleased God being
tried through many troubles, were found steadfast in faith. Again they that
received not their temtacions with the fear of God, but put them selves forth
with vnpaciency and murmuringe against God, Nume.xi. a and.xxi. a i. Corint.x. a
perysshed of the destroyer, and were slain or serpents. And therefore should
not we undertake to be avenged, for ye thing that is done unto us: but to
consydre, that al these punyshmentes are far less then our sins and
misdeeds. Romansviii d

Thus have I devised: Ye shall stand this night before the port, and I will go

remember his people of Israel, within five days, as ye have said. As for the

Judith decketh her self to go to Holofernes. The blessing that the Elders
gave Judith. Holofernes is in love with Judith.

CAPI. X.
ANd when she had left of cryinge unto Iudi.xvi
put of the garments of her widdowhode, washed her body, anointed her self with
precious things of sweet savor, broyded and platted her here, set an hooue
upon her heabe, and put on such apparel as belongs unto gladness, slippers
upon her fete, armelettes, spanges, earynges finger rings, and decked her self
with all her best array.

The Lord gave her also a special beautye and fayrenesse (for all this
deckynge of her self was not done for any voluptuousness, and pleasure of the
flesh, but of a right discreacion and virtue. therefore did the Lord increase
her beauty) so that she was exceeding amiable and well favored in all men's eyes.

She gave her maid also a bottel of wine a pot with oil, potage, cake bred
and chese, and went her way.



And as she was goinge down the mountain, it happened that about the spring
of the day, the spies of the Assirians met with her, and took her, saying:
whence come thou? Or whither go thou? She answered: I am a daughter of
the Hebrews, and am fled from them, for I know, that they shall be given unto
you to be spoiled: because they thought scorn to yield the^ selves unto you,
that they might find mercy in your sight. Therefore have I devised by my self
after this manner: I will go before the prince Holofernes, and tell him all
their secrets, and will show him, how he may come by them, and win them, so
that not one man of his host shall perysh.

And when these men had herd her words,

Holofernes requires of Judith the cause of her coming, which gives him a
subtyl answer.

CAPI. XI.


And Judith said unto him: Sir, understand the words of thy handmayden: for
if thou wylt do after the words of thy ha^dmayden, the Lord shall bring thy
matter to a prosperous effect. As truly as Nabuchodonozor a Lord of the land
lives, and as truly as his power lives, which is in the to the punishment of
all men that go wrong all men shall not only be suddued unto him through the,
but all the beestes also of ye feld. For all people speak of thy prudente
actyuytie, and it has ever been reported, how thou only art good and mighty
in all his kingdom, and thy discrecion is commended in all lands.

The thing is manifest also, that Achior Judith.v. a
and it is well known what thou commau^dedst to do unto him. For this is plain
and of a suertye, that our God is so wroth with us (by the reason of our
sins) that he has showed by his prophets unto the people, how that for
their sins he will deliver them over unto the enemy. And for so much as the
children of Israel know that they have so displeased their God, they are sore
afraid of the.

They suffer great honger also, and for want of water, they are deed now in a
manner. Moreover they are appointed to slaye all their catell, that they may
drink the blood of them: and are purposed to spend all the holy ornaments
of their God (which he has forbidden them to touch) for corne-wyne and oil.
Seeing now that they do these things, it is a plain case, that they

These words pleased Holofernes and al his servants, which marueyled at the
wisdom

Holofernes commands that Judith be well entreated. She desires license to
go out in the night season to pray, and obtayneth it. Vagao is sent unto her,
to move her to come in to Holofernes to a banquet, and she comes. Holofernes
is dronken.

CAPI. XII.




And so in the night season she went forth in to the valley of Bethulia, and
washed her self in the well water. Then went she up, and besought the Lord
God of Israel, that he would prospere her way, for ye delyueraunce of his
people. And so she went in, and remained clean in her tent, till she took her
meat in the evening.



Then went Vagao unto Judith, and said Let not ye good dought^r be afraid, to
come into my Lord, that she may be honored before him, that she may eat
and drink wine, and he merye with him. Unto whom Judith answered: Who am I,
that I should say my lord nay? what so ever is good before his eyes, I shall
do it: and look what is his pleasure, that shall I thyncke well done, as long
as I live.



Holofernes slepeth for very dronckennes, and Judith cutteth of his heed, and
goes therewith to her own people: of whom she is received with joy. They give
thanks unto God, for their delyueraunce. Judith speaks unto Achior, which
marueyleth at her feate done to Holofernes.

CAPI XIII.
Now when it was late in the night Eccle xxxi.c
for they were all ouerladen with wine. So was Judith alone in the chamber. As
for Holofernes he lay upon the bed all droncken, and of very dro^kennes fell a
sleep.

Then commanded Judith her mayde^, to stand with without before the door and
to wayt. And Judith stood before the bed, making her prayer with tears, and
moved her lyppes secretlye, and said: Strengthen me O Lord God of Israel, and
have respect unto the works of my hands in this hour, that thou may set
up thy city of Jerusalem like as thou have promised: O grant that by the I
may perform the thing, which I have devised through ye believe that I have in
the.

And when she had spoken this, she went

And so these two went forth together after their custom, as though they
would pray, and so passed by the host, and came through the valley unto the
port of the cyty. And Judith cried a far of unto ye watch men upon the
walls: Open the gates (said she) for God is with us, which has showed his
power in Israel. And when they heard her voice, they called the elders of the
city together. And they came al to mete her little and great, young and old,
for they thought not that she should have come so soon. So they lyghted
candels, and gathered about her euerychone: but she went up into an hye place
and caused silence to be proclaimed.

When every man now held his tongue, Judith said: O praise the Lord our God,
that put their trust in him, and in me his handmaiden he has performed his
mercy, which he promised unto the house of Israel: yea in my hand this same
night has he slain the ennemy of his people.

And with that she took forth the heed of Holofernes out of the wallet, and
showed it them, saying: Behold the heed of Holofernes the capiteyn of the
Assirians, and this is the canapy wherein he lay in his dronkennes: where the
Lord our God has slain him by the hand of a woman.

But as truly as the Lord lives his au^gel has kept me, going thither,
remaini^g there, and coming hither again from thence. And the Lord has not
suffered me his handmaide^ to be defiled, but without any filthynesse of syn
has he brought me again unto you, and that with great victory, so that I am
escaped and ye delivered. (...) iv. a (...)
O give thanks unto him euerychone, for he is gracious, and his mercy

So they praised the Lord all together, and gave thanks unto him. And to her
they said: The Lord has blessed the in his power, for through the he has
brought our enemies to naught. And Ozias the chief ruler of ye people of
Israel, said unto her: Blessed art you of the Lord the high God, above all
women upon earth.

Blessed be the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth, which has guyded the
aright, to wou^d and to smite of the heed of the captain of our enemies. For
this day he has made thy name so honorable, that thy praise shall never come
out of the mouth of me^, which shall always remember the power of the Lord, seeing
thou have not spared thine own self, but put the in ieopardy, considringe the
anguysh and trouble of thy people, and so have helped their fall before God our
Lord. And all the people said: Amen, Amen.

(...). a
and threatened the with destruction, saying: when the people of Israel is
taken, I shall cause yt also to be stickt with the swerd. When Achior saw
Holofernes heed he fell down upon his face to the ground for very anguish and
fear, so that he swowned withal. But after yt he was come again to him self,
he fell down before her, and praised her saying: Blessed art thou of thy God in
all the tabernacles of Jacob, for all the people that hear of thy name, shall
praise the God of Israel because of the.

The counsel of Judith. Achior being an heathen man, turns to God. The
Assyrians are afraid of the Jews.

IVdith said unto all the people: Brethren

Then Achior saying the power of God, which he had showed unto the people of
Israel, fell of from his Heathenish bylefe, and put his trust in God, and let
him self be circumcised: and so was he nombred among ye people of Israel, he
and all his posterity unto this day.

Now as soon as it was day, they stickte

But when the Capytaynes and Princes and all the chyefe in the king of the
Assyrians host came together, they said unto the chamberlaynes: Goo your way
in, and wake him up, for the myce are crepte out of their holes, i. Reg.xiiii. d
and dare provoke us unto battle.

Then went Vagao in to his chamber,

But when he had harkened perfectly with his ears and could perceive no
stering, he went nere to the bed, and lift it up, and then saw he the deed
body of Holofernes lyeng there without a heed, weltred in his blood, upon the
earth. Then cried he with loud voice, and with weeping rent his clothes, and
went in to Iudiths tent, and found her not: And so he lepte out unto the
people and said one woman of the Jews has brought all Nabuchodonosors people
to shame. For lo, Holofernes lies upon the ground, and has no heed.

When the chief of the Assirians host herd that, they rent their clothes, and
there fell an intolerable fear and tremblyng upon the^, so that their minds
were sore afraid. And there was an exceeding great cry in the hole host.

The flight of the Assyrians. The pursuit of Israel after them. Israel
becomes rich, by the spoils of the Assyrians. Judith is praised of Ioacim
and of the people. CAPI. XV.


And when the children of Israel saw that they fled, they followed upon them,
and went down with trompettes, blowyng and making a great cry after them: As
for the Assirians they had no order, and kept not them selves together, but
fled their way. Nevertheless the children of Israel fell upon them with one
company and order, and discomfeted as many as they might get, And Osias sent
messengers unto all the cities and countries of Israel.



Now when she came out unto them, they

In thyrtye days could the people of Israel scarce gather up the spoils of
the Assirians. But all that belonged unto Holoferfernes, and had been his
specially (whether it were of gold, of silver, of precious stones clothyng and
all orname^tes) they gave it unto Judith. And all the people reioysed, both
women, maidens, and young people, with pipes and harpes.

Lord. (...) viii. b (...) xiii. b
The people was joyful as the use is: and this joy by reason of the victory
with Judith, endured three months.

So after these days, every man went home again, and Judith was in great
reputacion at Bethulia, and right honorably taken in all the land of Israel.
Unto her virtue also was chastity joined, so that after her husband Manasses
died, she never knew man all the days of her life. Upon the hye solemn days
she went out with great worship. She dwelte in her husbands house an hundred
and five year, and left her handemayden free and dyed, and was buried beside
her husband in Bethulia. And all the people mourned for her seven days. So
long as she lived, (...). b
there was none that troubled Israel, and many years also after her death.

The day wherein this victory was gotten, was solemnly holden and reckened of
the Jews, in the nombre of the holy days, and it is yet greatly holden of
the jews ever sense, unto this day.

land: and that he saw two great dragons ready to fight one against an other.
Their cry was great: At the which roryng and cry, all Heathen were up to
fight against the ryghtous people. And the same day was full of darckenesse,
and very vnclere,

Now when Mardocheus had seen this dreme he awoke, and mused steadfastly in his
heart, what God would do: and so he desired to know all the matter, and his mind
was thereupon until the night.

destroy not your selves through the works of your own hands. For God has
not made death, neither has he pleasure in the destruction of the living. For
he created all things, that they might have their being: yea all the people
of the earth has he made that they should have health, that there should he no
destruction in them, and yt the kingdom of hell should not be upon earth (for
ryghtousnesse is everlasting and immortal, but vnryghtousnesse brings
death.) Nevertheless, the ungodly call her unto them, both with words and

from death for we are borne of naught and we shall be hereafter as though we
had never been. For our breath is a smoke in our nostrels, and the words as a
sparcke to move our heart. As for our body, it shall be very ashes that are
quenched, and our soul shall vanysh as the soft air. Our life shall pass
away as the trace of a cloud, and come to naught as the myste that is driven
away with the beams of the sun, and put down with the heat thereof. Our
name also shall be forgotten by little and little and no man shall have our works
in remembrance.

For our time is a very shadow that passes away, and after our end, ii.

there is no returning, for it is fast sealed, so that no man comes again.
Come on therefore, let us enjoy the pleasures that be present, and let us
soon use ye creature like as in youth. We will fill our selves with good wine
and ointment, there shall no flower of the time go by us. We will crown our
selves with roses before they be wythered. There shall be no fair meadow, but
our lust shall go through it. Let every one of you be partaker of our
voluptousnesse. Let us leave some token of our pleasure in every place, for
that is our porcyon, else get we nothing. Let us oppress the poor rightous,
let us not spare the wyddow ne old man, let us not regard ye heedes that are
gray for age.

Let the law of vnryghtonesse be our auctorytye, for the thing that is feeble
is nothing worth. Therefore let us defraude the ryghtous, and why? he is not
for our profyt, yea he is clean contrary to our doings. He Ioh.vii. a
Esaias.liii. a
for his life is not like other men's, his ways are of an other fashyon. He
counts us but vain persons, he withdraws him self from our ways as from
fylthynesse: he commends greatly the latter end of the just, and makes his
booste that God is his father. Let us se then if his words be true, let us
prove what shall come upon him: so shall we know what end he shall have.

For if he be the true son of God, he will receive him and deliver him from
the hands of his enemies. Let us examen him with despytefull rebuke and
tormentynge, Psalm.xxi. a Mat.xxvii e Ierem.xi. d
yt we may know his dignite, and prove his patience. Let us condemn him with
the most shameful death: for like as he has spoken, so shall he be rewarded.

Such things do the ungodly ymagyn, and go astraye, for their own
wickedness has blinded them. As for the mysteryes of God, they understand
them not: they neither hope for the reward of ryghtousnesse, ne regard the
worship that holy souls shall have. For God created man to be undestroyed,

good things darcke, the unsteadfastness also and wickedness of volouptuous

yet fulfilled he much time. For his soul pleased God therefore hasted he to
take him away from among the wicked. This the people se and understand it

Thus the ryghtous that is deed, condemns the Lord has taken him away. And

the ungodly were destroyed. For like as thou have hurt our enemies, so have
thou promoted us whom thou calledst before. For the rightous children of the
good men offered secretly, and ordered the law of rigtousnesse unto unite, that
the just should receive good and evil in like manner, synging praises unto the

The end of the book of wisdom.
THE BOOK OF (...) Jesus.
JESUS THE SON OF SIRACH, WHICH IS CALLED IN LATYNE ECCLESIASTICVS.
The prologe of Jesus the son of Sirach, unto his book.
MAny and great men have declared wisdom unto us, out of the law, out of
the Prophets, and out of other that followed them. In the which things Israel
ought to be commended, by the reason of doctrine, and wysdom: Therefore they
that have it, and read it, should not only them selves be wise there through,
but serve other also with teaching and writing.

After that my graundfather Jesus had given diligent labor to read the law,
the Prophets, and other books that were left us of our fathers, and had well
exercysed him self therein: he purposed also, to write some thing of wisdom,
and good manners, to the intent that they which were willing to learn and to be
wise might have the more understanding, and be the more apt to lead a good
conuersacyon.

Wherefore I exhort you to receive it louinly, to read it with dylygence, and
to take it in good worth, though our words be not so eloquent as the famos
Orators. For the thing that is written in the Hebrew tongue, sounds not so
well, when it is translated in to an other speech. Not only this book of
mine, but also the law, the Prophets, and other books, sound far otherwise,
the^ they do, when they are spoken in their own language.

Now in the.xxxviij. year when I came in to Egypt, in the time of Ptolomy
Euerges, and continued there all my life, I gat liberty to read and write
many good things. Wherefore I thought it good and necessary, to bestow my
diligence and travail to interpret this book. And consydrynge that I had
time, I labored and did my best to perform this book, and to bring it unto
light: that the strangers also which are disposed to learn, might apply
them selves unto good manners, and live according to the law of the Lord.

measured ye heygthe of heaven, the breadth of the earth, and the depenesse of

of prudence from everlasting. (Gods word in the heygth, is the well of

that preserves and iustifyeth the heart, and gives mirth a gladness. Who so
fears the Lord, shall be happy: and when he have need of comfort, he shall be

treasure. The fear of the Lord, is the crown of wisdom, and gives
plenteous peaxe and health. He has seen her and nombred her: knowledge and
understanding of wisdom has he poured out as rain: and them that held her
fast, has he brought unto honor.



In the treasures of wisdom is the declaracyon of doctrine, but the sinner
abhors the worship of God. My son, if thou desire w^sdom, keep the

sight of men, and take good head what thou speak. Mark well these things,
lest thou happen to fall, and bring thy soul to dishonor, and so God
discover thy secrets, and cast the down in the myddest of the congregacyon:
because thou would not receive the fear of God, and because thy heart is
full of faynednesse and disceyte.

sins in the time of trouble, and is a defender for all them that seek him in
the truth. Woe be unto him yt has a double heart wicked lyppes and evil
occupied hands, and to the sinner yt goes two manner of ways. Woe be unto

shall they not be defended of him. Woe be unto them that have lost patience,
forsaken the right ways, and are turned back, in to froward ways. What will
they do, when the Lord shall begin to vyset them?

They that fear the Lord, will not mystrust John.xiiii. b

Trust not in wicked riches, for they shall not help in the day of punishment

so does the sinner that has a double tongue. Stand taste in the way of the
Lord, be steadfast in thy understanding, abide by the word, and follow the
word of peace and ryghtousnesse. Be gentle to hear the word of God, that
thou may understand it, and make a true answer with wisdom. Jacob.i. b
Be swyft to hear, but slow and pacient in gyuynge answer. If thou have
understanding, shape thy neighbor an answer: If no, lay thine hand upon
thy mouth: lest thou be trapped in an indiscreet word, and so confounded.
Honor and worship is in a man's wise talkyng, but the tongue of the indiscreet,
Leuiti.xix. d
is his own destruction. Be not a pryuye accuser as long as thou lyuest, and
use no sklau^dre with thy tongue. For shame and sorrow goes over the thief, and
an evil name over him that is double tonged: but he that is a preuy accuser of
other men, shall be hated enuyed and confounded. Se that thou iustyfye the small

And though the physician show his help never so long, yet in conclusion it

wyther away, he has brought them to naught, and made the memorial of them to
cease from out of the earth (God has destroyed the name of the proud, and
left the name of the humble of mind.) Pride was not made for man, neither
wrothfulnes for men's children: the sede of man that fereth God shall be brought

rich by living nygardly, Luke.xii. b

rest, and now will I eat and drink of my goods my self alone. And yet be
consydreth not, that the time draws nigh, that he must leave al these things

exercise thy self therein, and remain in the work unto thy age. Continue not

for it is but an easy thing in the sight of God, to make a poor man rich,
Eccle.xviii.c
forget not adversity: and when it goes not well with the, have a good hope yt
it shall be better. For it is but a small thing unto God in the day of death

What fellowship should an holy man have with a dog? How can the rich and the
poor agree together? The wyld ass is the lions pray in the wilderness, even
so are poor men the meat of the rich. Like as ye proud may not away with
lowlynesse, even so does the rych abhor the poor. If a rich man fall, his
friends set him up again, but when ye poor falls, his friends forsake him.
If a rich man fall in to an error, he has many helpers, he speaks proud

is wicked unto him self, how should he be good unto other men? How can such
one have any pleasure of his goods? There is nothing wors then when one
disfauoureth him self, and this is a reward of his wickedness. If he do any
good, he does it not knowing thereof, and against his will, and at the last he
declares his ungraciousness. A nigard has a wicked eye, he turns away his
face, and despyseth his own soul. A covetous man's eye has never enough in

Who will praise the Lord in the hell? Abide not thou in the error of the
ungodly, but give him thanks before death. Psalm.vii. a Esa.xxxviii. d
thankfulness peryssheth from him as nothing. Give thou thanks in thy
life, yea while thou art living and hole, shall thou give thanks, and praise
God, and rejoice in his mercy. O how great is the loving kyndnesse of the
Lord and his merciful goodness unto such as turn unto him? For all
things may not be in man: And why? the son of man is not immortal, and he
has pleasure in the vanity of wickedness. What is more clear then the
sun? yet shall it fail. Or what is more wicked then the thing that flesh
and blood has ymagyned? and that same shall be reproved. The Lord seith the
power of the hye heaven, and all are but earth and ashes.

The marvelous works of God, the mysery and wretchedness of man. Against God
ought we not to complain. Pray must we continually.

HE that lives for evermore, made all Gene.i. a
God only is ryghtous, and remains a victoryous king for ever. Who shall he
hable to express the works of him? Who has sought out the ground of his
noble acts? Who shall declare the power of his greatness? Or who will take
upon him to tell out his mercy? As for the wondrous works of ye Lord, there
may nothing be taken from them, nothing may be put unto them, neither may
the ground of them be found out. But when a man has done his best, he
must begin again: and when he thinks to be come to an end, he must goo
again to his labor. What is man? Whereto is he worth? Psalm.lxxxix. ^
What good or evil can he do? If the nombre of a man's days be almost an
hundredth years, it is much.

Like as the drops of rain are unto the sea, and as a gravel stone is in
comparyson ii. Petri.iii. b
Therefore is the Lord pacient with them, and pours out his mercy upon
them. He saw and perceived the thoughts and ymaginacions of their heart, that
they were evil: therefore heaped he up his merciful goodness upon them, and
showed them the way of ryghtousnesse. The mercy that a man has, reaches to
his neighbor, but the mercy of God is upon al flesh. He chasteneth, he
teaches and nourtoureth: yea even as a shepherde tourneth again his flock,
so does he all them that receive chastenynge, nourtoure and doctrine.
Esaias.lxvi. a
Merciful is he unto them that stand in awe of his judgments.

My son, when thou do good, make no good honest gift? but a gracyous man
gives them both. A fool shall cast a man in the teeth, and that roughly, and
a gift of the nygarde puts out the eyes. Prouer.xv. a and.xxv.c
Get the rightousnesse before you come to judgment: learn before thou speak,
and goo to physycke or ever thou be sick: examyn and judge thy self before
the judgment come, and so shall thou find grace in the sight of God. Humble
thy self before thou be sick, and in time of thy disease show thy
conversation. Let not to pray always, Luke.xviii. a ii. Tessa.v. d
and stand not in fear to be reformed unto death, for the reward of God
endures for ever. Before thou prayest prepare thy soul, and be not as one
that tempts God. Eccl.vii. b
Think upon the wrathful indignacion that shall be at the end, and the hour
of vengeance, when he shall turn away his face. When thou have enough,
remember the time of honger, Eccle.xi. e

minded, and does against him self. Who so reioyseth in wickedness shall be
punished: he yt hates to be reformed, his life shall be shortened: and he that
abhors bablyng of words, quenches wyckednes. He that offends against his
own soul, shall repent it: and he that reioyseth in wickedness shall be
punysshed.

Rehearse not a wicked and churlish word Leuiti.xi^. d Math.xv^^^
like as a woman yt is payned with bearyng of child. Like as an arow shot in a
dogs thigh, so is a word in a foles heart. Tell thy friend his fault, lest he
be ignorant, and say: I have not done it, or if he have done it, that he do
it no more. Reprove they neighbor, that he keep his tongue, and if he have
spoken, that he say it no more.

Tell thy neighbor his fault, for often times an offense is made, and give not
crede^ce Eccle.xiiii* ^ and.xxv. b Jacob.iii. ^
A man falls sometime with his tongue, but not with his will. For what is he
that has not offended in his tongue? Give thy neighbor warnyng before thou
threaten him, and give place unto the law of the Lord. The fear of God is
all wisdom, and he that is a ryghtous man keeps the law. As for the doctrine
of wickedness it is no wisdom, and the prudence of sinners is no good
understanding: it is but wickedness and abhominacion, and a blasphemyng of
wysdom. A simple man of small understanding that fears God, is better then
one that has much wysdom, and transgresses the law of the highest. A craftye

CAPI. XX.
SOme man reproves his neighbor often times, but not in due season. Again,
Eccles.xxxi. d
and he is wise and dyscrete. It is much better to give warnyng, and to
reprove, then to bear evil will: for he that knowledgeth him self openly,
shall be preserved from hurt and destruction. Like as when a gelded man
through desire and lust defyleth a maiden, even so is it with him that uses
vyole^ce, and vnryghtousnesse in the law: O how good a thing is it, a man
that is reproved, to show openly his repentance, for so shalt thou esscape
wylful syn.

Some man keeps silence, and is found wise: but he that is not ashamed what
he says: is hateful. Some man holds his tongue, because he has not the

oportunitye, but a wanton and indiscreet body shall regard no time. He that
uses many words, shall hurt his own soul: and he that takes authority
upon him vnryghtously shall be hated. Some man has often times prosperity in
wicked things: Again, some man gets much, and has harm and loss.
There is some gift that is nothing worth: Again, there is some gift, whose
reward is double. Some man gets a fall, for being to proud, and some
comes to worship from the low estate. Some man byeth much for a little price,
and must pay for it seuenfolde.

(...) vi. a
A wise man with his words makes him self to be loved, but the favors of
fools shall be poured out. The gift of the unwise shall do the no good, for

day he lends, to morrow he asks it again, and such a man is to be hated.
The fool says: I have no friend, I have no thank for all my good deeds: yea
even they that eat my breed, speak no good of me. O how often, and of how many
shall he be laughed to scorn? He takes a more perilous fall by such words,
then if he fell upon the ground: even so shall the falls of wicked men come
hastelye. In the mouth of him yt is untaught, are many inconvenient and unmeet
words. A wise sentence shall not be allowed, at the mouth of the fool, for he
speaks it not in due season.

Rewards and gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and make him dom, that he can
not tell men their fautes. Wisdom that is hyd, and treasure yt is hoorded up,
what profit is in the^ both? Better is he that keeps his ignorance secret,
then a man that hydeth his wisdom.

Of the repentance of sin we may not heap sin upon sin. The boldness

Strife and wrongous dealyng shall waste away a man's goods: and through pride
a rich house shall be brought to naught: so the riches of the proud shall be
roted out. The prayer of the poor goes out of the mouth, and comes unto
the ears, and his vengeance (or defense) shall come, and that hastelye. Who
so hates to be reformed it is a token of an ungodly person: but he that
fears God, will remember him self. A mighty man is known a far of by his
tongue but he that has understanding perceyueth that he shall have a fall.

CAPI. XXII.
A Slouthful body is molded of a stone of claye: he that touches him, must
wash his hands again. A misnurtured son is the dishonor of the father. A

her husband: but she that comes to dishonesly, brings her father in to
heaviness. A daughter that is past shame, dishonors both her father and her
husband: the ungodly shall regard her, but they both shall dispyse her, the
playinge of musycke is not mete where heaviness is, even so is the correction and
doctrine of wisdom ever unpleasant unto fools.

Who so teaches a fool, is even as one Gene.v. b

report shall she leave behind her, and her dishonor shall not be put out. And
they that remain, shall know that there is nothing better then, the fear of
God: and that there is nothing sweter then to take heed unto the
commandments of the Lord. A great worship is it to follow the Lord, for

Psalm.cxxxii. b
even in the porcyon of the Lord and in is his heretage, and kept me in the
fullness of the saynctes. I am set up on hye like a Ceder upon Lybanus, and as
a Cypres tree upon the mount Hermon: I am exalted like a palm tree in Cades,
and as a rose plant in Jericho: As a fair olyue tree in the field, and am
exalted like a planteyn tree by the waters side. I have given a smell in the
streets, as the Cynamom and Balm, that has so good a sauoure: yea a sweet
odoure have I given, as it were Myrre of the best.

John.xv. a
As the vine, have I brought forth fruit of a sweet sauoure, and my flowers
are the fruit of honor and richesse. I am the mother of bewtye, of love, of
fear, of knowledge and of holy hope. John.xiiii. a
In me is all grace of life and truth: In me is all hope of life and virtue. O
come unto me, all ye that be desirous of me, and fill your selves with my
fruits: for my sprete is sweter then honye, and so is mine inherytaunce more
then the honey comb: the remembrance of me endures for evermore. They that
eat me, shall have the more hunger: and they that drink me, shall thirste
the more. Who is herkeneth unto me, shall not come to confusion: and they that
work in me, shall not offend. They that make me to be known, shall have
everlasting life.

All these things are the book of life, the covenant of the highest, and the
knowledge of the truth. Exodi.xx. a and.xxiiii a
Moses commands the law in the precepts of ryghtousnesse, for an heretage
unto the house of Jacob, and committed the promyses unto Israel. Out of David
his servant, Psalm.cxxxi. b Acto.ii. d
he ordained to raise up a most mighty king, syttyng in the seat of honor
for evermore. This fylleth with wisdom, like as the floude of Physon,
Deuteronomy.iiii. a. and.xx^x. b

This brings a plenteous understanding Iosue.iii. e

counsel is profounder then the great deep.

I wisdom have cast out floudes. I am as a great waterbroke out of the river.
I am as the river Dorir, and as a water condyte am I come out of the garden of
pleasure. I said: I will water the garden of my young plants, and fill the
fruit of my birth. So my water broke became exceeding great, and my river
approached unto the sea. For I make doctrine to be unto all men, as light as the
fair morning, and I shall make it to be ever the clearer, I will pearse
through all the lower parts of the earth, I will look upon all such as sleep,
and lyghten all them that put their trust in the Lord. I shall yet pour out
doctrine, like as prophesy, and leave it unto such as seek after wisdom, and
their generacions shall I never fail, unto the holy everlasting world.
Behold how that I have not labored for my self only, but for all them that

If thou have gathered nothing in thy youth, what will thou find then in
thine age? O how pleasant a thing is it when graye headed men are discrete,
and when the elders can give good counsel? O how comely a thing is wysdom unto

men is to have much experyence, and the fear of God is their worship.

O how great is he that fyndeth wisdom and knoweledge? Yet is he not above
him, that fears the Lord. The fear of God has set it self above all
things. Blessed is the man, unto whom it is granted to have the fear of God.
Unto whom shall he be lykened, that keeps it fast? The fear of God is the
beginning of his love, and the beginning of faith is to cleave fast unto it.
The heaviness of the heart is all punishment, and the wyckednes of a woman goes
above all. All punishment and plage is nothing in comparyson of the plage of
the heart, even so all wyckednes is nothing to the wyckednes of a woman.

What so ever happens unto a man, is willers do unto him: and all vengeance
is nothing to the vengeance of the enemy.

(...)
There is not a more wicked heed then the heed of the serpent, and there is no
wrath above the wrath of a woman. I will rather dwell with a lion and dragon,
then to keep house with a wicked wife. The wickedness of a woman changes her
face, she shall moffell her countenance as it were a Beer, and as a sack shall
she show it among the neighbors. Her husband is brought to shame among his
neighbors, and when he hears it, it makes him to syghe. All wickedness is
but little to the wickedness of a woman, the porcyon of the ungodly shall fall
upon her.

(...). b (...)
even so is a wife full of words to a still quyete man. Look not to narowly
upon the bewtye of a woman, lest thou be provoked in desire toward her. The
wrath of a woman is dishonor and great confusyon. If a woman get the
mastrie, then is the contrary to her husband. A wicked wife makes a sorye
heart, an heuye countenance, (...) viii. b
and a deed wound. Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and through her
we all are deed. Give thy water no passage, no not a little, neither give a
wicked woman her will. If she walk not after thy hand, she shall confound

do not always abuse the.

heart, and a cherefull countenance, there be three things that my heart
fears, and my face is afraied of the fourth. Treason in a city, a sedycyous
people, and noysom tongues, all these are heuyer the^ death. But when one is
gelous over his wife, it brings pain and sorrow unto the heart: and a woman
that tells out all things, is a scourge of the tongue. When one has an evil
wife, it is even as when an unlike pare of oxen must draw together, he that

her husband and fedeth his bones with her wisdom. A woman of few words, is
a gift of God, and to a well nurtoured mind may nothing be compared.

An honest and manerly woman is a gift above other gifts, and there is no
weyghte Genesisv. d
so is the beauty of the face upon an honest body. Like as the golden pyllers

Lend unto thy neighbor in time of his need, and pay thou thy neighbor
again in due season. Keep thy word, and deal faithfully with him, and thou
shalt always find the thing that is necessary for the. There have been many,
that when a thing was lent them, reckened it to be found, and made the^
travail and labor that had helped them. While they receive any thing, they
kiss the hands of such as give them, and for their neighbors good they
humble their voice. But when they should pay again, they keep it back, and
give evil words, and make many excuses by reason of the time: and though he
be hable, yet gives he scarce the half again, and reckeneth the other to be
found. And if he withholde not his money, yet has he an enemy of him, and
that undeserved.

neighbor: and when he has lost his honesty, he shall forsake him. Suretyshyp
has destroyed many a rych man, and removed them as the waves in the sea.
Mighty people has it driven away, and caused them to wandre in strange
countries. An ungodly man, transgressynge the commandment of the Lord,
shall fall in to an evil suretyshyp: and though he force him self to get out,

thy mind in to heaviness, and vex not thy self in thine own counsel. The joy
and cherefulnesse of the heart, is the life of man, and a man's gladness is
the prolongynge of his days. Love thine own soul, and comfort thine heart:
as for sorrow and heaviness, drive it far from the, for heaviness has
slain many a man, and brings no profit. Zeal and anger shorten the days
of the life: carfulness and sorrow, bring age before the time. Unto a merry

children, from the day that they go out of their mothers womb, till they be
buried in (the earth) the mother of all things: namely, their thoughts and
ymaginacyons, fear of the heart, counsel, meditacyons, longing and desire,
the day of death: from the highest that sytteth upon the glorious seat, unto
the lowest and most simple upon the earth: from him that is gloryously arrayed
and wears a crown, until him that is but homelye and symplye clothed. There
is nothing but wrath, zele, fearfulness, unquietness, and fear of death,
rygorous anger and strife. And in the night when one should rest and sleep
upon his bed, the sleep changes his understanding and knowledge. A little as
nothing is in his rest, in the sleep as well as in the day of labor.

Eccle.xxxix. e Genesisvii. d and.iii. a
bloudsheddyng, strife and sword, oppressyon, hungre, destruction and
punysshmente: these things are all created against the ungodly, and for their
sakes came the floude also. All that is of the earth, shall turn to earth
again: and all waters ebb again in to the sea. All brybes and
vnrightousnesse shall be put away, but faythfullness^ and truth shall endure
for ever. The substance and goods of the ungodly shall be dried up, and synke
away as a water floude, and they shall make a sound: like a great thondre in
the rain.

Eccle xli. b
The children of the ungodly shall not obtain many branches: and the unclean
rotes upon the hye rocks, shall be roted out before the grass by the water
side, and upon the river banks.

Frendlynesse and lyberalytie in the increase and blessing of God, is like a
paradyse and ga^den of pleasure: such mercy also and kindness endures for ever.
i. Timot.vi ^ Philip.iiii. ^
To labor and to be content with that a man has, is a sweet pleasant life: and
that is to find a treasure above all treasures. To beget children and to
repair the city, makes a perpetual name: but an honest woman is more worth
then they both. Wine and minstrelsy rejoice the heart, but the love of wisdom
is above them both.

Pypyng and harpynge make a sweet noise, but a friendly tongue goes beyond the^
both.

The fear of the Lord wants nothing and needs no help. The fear of the
Lord is a pleasant garden of blessing, and nothing so beautyfull as it is.
My son, led not a beggars life, for better it were to dye then to beg. Who
so looks to an other man's table, takes no thought for his own living how to
uphold his life, for he fedeth him self with other men's meat. But a wise and
well nourtoured man will beware thereof. Beggyng is sweet in ye mouth of the
unshamefast, but in his belly there burns a fire.

Of the remembrance of death. Death is not to be feared. A curse upon them
that forsake the law of God. Good name and fame. An Exhortacion to give head
unto wisdom. Of what things a man ought to be ashamed.

CAPI. XLI.
O Death, Death.
how bitter is the remembrance Gene.viii.
And why would thou be against this pleasure of the highest? Whether it be
ten, an hundredth, or a thousand years: death asks not how long one has
lived.

The children of the ungodly are abhomynable Eccle.xl.c
The inherytaunce of ungodly children shall come to naught, and their
posterytye shall have perpetual shame and confusion. The children complain of
an ungodly father: and why? for his sake they are rebuked and despised. Woe be
unto you (O ye ungodly) which have forsaken the law of the highest God: if ye
be borne, ye shall be borne to cursynge, if ye dye, the curse shall be your
porcyon.

(...) xl b
All that is of the earth, shall turn to earth again: so go the ungodly also
out of the curse in to destruction. The sorrow of men is in their body: but
the name of the ungodly shall be put out, for it is nothing worth. Labor to

things be not thou ashamed, and accept no person to offend. Namely, of these
things be not ashamed: Of the law of God, of the covenant, of judgment: to
bring the ungodly from his ungodliness unto ryghtousnesse, and to make him a
good man: to deal faithfully with thy neybour and companyo^: to distribute ye
heretage unto ye friends: to be dilyge^t to keep true measure and weight: to be

goods in byinge and selling: to bring up children with diligence: to correct
an evil servant, to keep that thine is from an evil wife: to set a lock
where many hands are: what thou delyuerest and gyuest out to be kept, to tell

Psalm.ix. a
the beauty of the heaven in his glorious clerenesse. The sun when it
appears, declares the day in the going out of it, a marvelous work of
the highest. At noone it burns the earth, and who may abide for the heat
thereof? Who so keeps an oven when it is hot, three times more does the Sun
burn upon the mountains, when it breaths out the fyrie beams and shyneth:
with the bryghtnesse of it, it blyndeth the eyes. Great is the Lord that made
it, and in his commandment he causes it to ren hastelye.

Gene.i. b
The Moon also is in all, and at convenient season it shows the times, and is
a token of the time. The token of the solemn feast is taken of the Moon,
Exodusxii. a
a light that mynissheth and increases again. The Month is called after the
Moon, it grows wonderously in her chaungynge.

Genesisix. d
very bewtyfull is it in his shine. He compasses the heaven about with his
clerenesse and glory, the hands of the highest have bended it. Through his
commandment he makes the snow to fall, and the thondre of his judgment to
smite hastly. Through his commandment the treasures are opened, and the
clouds fly as the fowls. In his power has he strengthened the clouds, and
broken the hayle stones.

The mountains melt at the sight of him, the wind blows according to his
will. The sound of his thondre bears the earth so does the storm of the
north: the whirle wind also lyghteth down as a fethered foul, casts out
and spredeth the snow abroad: and as the greshoppers that destroy all, so
falls it down. The eye marueleth at the bewtye of the whytenesse thereof, and
the heart is afraied at the rain of it. He pours out the frost upon the
earth, like salt, and when it is frosen, it is as sharp as ye prik of a
thystle.

When the cold Northwynde blows,

In his word he stylleth the wind. In his counsel he sets the deep, and
the Lord Jesus planted it. They that sail over the sea, tell of his peryls
and harms: and when we hear it with our ears, we marvel thereat. For there
be strange wondrous works diverse manner of nyce beasts, and whalefisshes.
Through him are al things set in good order and performed, and in his word al
things endure.

yet are ye in no wise hable sufficiently to praise him. Who has seen him,
that he might tell us? Who can magnyfye him so greatly as he is? For there are
hyd yet greater things then these be: as for us, we have seen but few of his
works. For the Lord has made all things, and given wisdom to such as fear
God.

The praise of certain holy men, Henoch, Noe, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

CAPI. XIIII.
LEt us commend the noble famous men and the generacyon of our fore elders
Exodi.xvii ^
Wise sentences are found in their instruction: They sought the swetnesse and
melody of Music, and brought forth the pleasant songs in Scripture. They
were rich also, and could comfort and pacyfye those that dwelt with them.
All these were very noble and honorable me^ in their generacions and were well
reported of in their times.

These have left a name behind them so that their praise shall always be
spoken of. Afterward there were some, whose remembrance is gone. Gene.vii. d
They came to naught and perisshed, as though they had never been: and
became as though they had never been borne, yea and their children also with
them.

Nevertheless these are loving men whose Eccle.xlix. ^ Gene.v.c
and the congregation can talk of their praise. Enoch walked right and
acceptably before the Lord: therefore was he translated for an example of
amendment to the generacions. Noe was a steadfast and rightous man: and in the
time of wrath, he became a reconcylynge. Therefore was he left a remnaunt unto
the earth, when the floude came. An everlasting covenant was made with him,
that al flesh should perysh no more with the water.

With Isaac did he stablish the same covenant, for Abraham his fathers sake.

Upon the same also there was a work fastened, Exodusxxviii. ^
all bound with gold: and this he brought in his ministracion. The stones were
fastened for a remembrance, after the.xij. trybes of Israel. Upon his mitre
there was a plate of pure gold, a graven image of holiness, a famous and noble
work, garnysshed, and pleasant to look upon. Before him were there seen no
such fair orname^tes, and these it behooved him always to use: There might none
other put them on, but only his children and his childers children perpetually.
Leuiti.viii. ^
Daily performed he his burntofferynges two times. Moses filled his hands,
and anointed him with holy oil.

This was now confyrmed him with an Deute.xvii. e and xxi. a Mala.ii. a
and to infourme Israel in his law.

Therefore there stood up certain against Nume.xvi. b
namely, they that were of Dathan, and Abirams side, and the furyous
congregacyon of Chore. This the Lord saw, and it displeased him, and in his
wrothful indygnacyon were they consumed. A great wondre did he upon them, and
consumed them with the fire. Besides this he made Aaron yet more honorable and
glorious. Nume.xvii.c
He gave him an heritage, and departed the first fruits unto him. Exodusxxv. f
Leuit.xxiiii. b
Unto him specyallye he appointed the bred for sustenaunce (for the prestes ate
of the offrynges of the Lord) this gave he unto him and his sede. Other
heritage or portion he had none in the la^d, with the people. For the Lord him
self is his portion and inheritance.

The third noble and excellent man is Numer.xv. ^
For when the people were turned back, he put him self forth right soon,
and that with a good will, to pacyfye the wrath of the Lord toward Israel.
Therefore was there a covenant of peax made with him, that he should be the
pryncypal among the ryghtous and the people that he and his posterytye should
have the office of the prestehode for ever. Like as there was made a couenaunte
with David of the trybe of Judah, that from among his sons only there should be
a king: and that Aaron also and his sede should be the heritage, to give us
wisdom in our heart, to judge his people in rightousnes: that his goods
should not come in to forgetfulness, and that their honor might endure for
ever.

punysshe the enemies that rose up against Israel. that Israel might obtain
their inheritance. O how great, noble, and excellent was he, when he lift up
his hand, and drew out his sword against the cytyes? Who stood so manly
before him? For the Lord him self brought in the enemies. Ios^
Stood not the Sun still at his commandment, and one day was as long as
two? He called upon the highest and most mighty, when the enemies preased upon
him on every side: and the Lord herd him with hayle stones. They smote the
Heythennysh people myghtely, and in falling down they slew all the
adversaries, lo that the Heathen knew his host, and al his defense, that the
Lord him self fought against them, for he lowed upon the mighty men of them.

Iosue.xiiii e
and his sede conquered the same for an heritage: that all the children of
Israel might se, how good a thing it is, to be obedient unto the Lord. And the
judges or eulers (every one after his name) whose heart went not a horynge, ne
departed from the Lord, and that forsake not the Lord unfaithfully, whose
remembrance has a good report: Yea their bones florysshe out of their
place, and their name shall never be changed.

i. Regu^. ^ii.a
He discomfyted the princes of Tire, all the rulers of the Philistynes. Before
his last end, he made protestacyon in the sight of the Lord, and his
anointed, that he took neither substance ne good of any man, no not so much as
a shoo: and no man might accuse him. After this he told, that his end was at
hand, and showed the the king also his end and death: and from the earth
lift he up his voice in the prophecye, that the ungodly people should perysh.

The praise of Nathan, David, and Solomon

CAPI. XLVII.
Afterward in the time of king David, there rose up a prophet called Nathan:
i. Regum ^
For like as the fat is taken away from the offrynge, so was David chosen out
of the children of Israel. He took his pastyme with ye lions and with kyddes,
and with bears like as with lambs. i. Regu^.x^
Slew he not a gyaunt when he was yet but young, and took away the rebuke from
his people? what time as he took the stone in his hand, and smote down proud
Goliath with the sling? For he called upon the highest Lord, which gave him
strength in his right hand, so that the ouerthrewe the mighty gyaunte in the
battle, that he might set up the horn of his people again. Thus brought he
him to worship above al princes, and made him i. Regu^.xv^
that he should were a crown of glory. ii. Regu^.v^
For he destroyed the enemies on every side, roted out the the Philistines
his adversaries, and brake their horn in sundre like as it is broken yet this
day. In all his works he praised the highest and holiest, and ascrybed the
honor unto him. ii. Par.xx^
With his hole heart did he praise and love him that made him. He set syngers
also before the altar, and in their tune he made sweet songs. He ordained to
keep the holy days worship fully, and that the solemn feasts through the
hole year should de honorably holden, with praysyng the name of the Lord,
and with his singing bytimes in the morninge in the Sanctuary.

The Lord took away his sins, i. Reg.xii^
and ii. Reg.iii ^
After him there rose up the wise son called Solomon, and for his sake he
drove ye enemies away far of. This Solomon raygned with peax in his time (for
God gave him rest from his enemies on every side, that he might buyld him an
house in his name, and prepare the Sanctuary for ever) like as he was well
instruct in his youth and filled with wisdom as and understanding, as it were
with a water floude. He covered and filled the hole land with symylytudes and
wise prudente sentences.

His name went abroad in the Isles, because of his peax he was beloved. All
lands merueyled at his songs, proverbs, symylytudes, and at his peax, and at
the name of the Lord God, iii. Reg.x. ^
which is called the God of Israel. He gathered gold as tynne, and he had as
much silver as lead. He was moved in inordinate love toward women, and was
overcome in affection, he stained his honor and worship: yea, his posterity
defiled he also, (...) xi. ^
in bryngyng the wrath of ye Lord upon his children, and sorrow after his joy:
so yt his kingdom was divided, (...) xii.c
and Ephraim became an unfaithful and an inconstant kingdom. Nevertheless God
forsook not his mercy, (...) vii.c
neither was he utterly destroyed because of his works, that he should leave
him no posterity.

the son of Nabat, which caused Israel to sin, and showed Ephraim the way of
ungodliness: In so much that their sins, and misdedes had the upper hand so
sore that at the last they were driven out of the land for the same: Yea he
sought out and brought up all the wickedness, till the vengeance came upon
them.

The praise of Eliah, Helizeus, Ezechias, and Esaye.

CAPI. XLVIII.
(...) xvii. a
For they might not away with the commandments of the Lord. Through the
word of the Lord, he shut the heaven, and three times brought he the fire
down. Thus became Eliah honorable i^ his wo^derous deeds. Who may make his
booste to be like him? (...)
One that was deed raised he up from death, and in the word of the highest he
brought him out of the grave again. (...) ^vii.c
He cast down kings and destroyed them, and the honorable from their seat.
Upon the mount Syna he herd the punishment, and upon Horeb the judgment of
the vengeance. He prophesied reco^pensyng unto kings, and ord^yned Prophets
after him. (...)
He was taken up in the storm of fire in a charet of horses of the Lord. He
was ordained in the reprouynges in time to pacifye the wrath, to turn the
hertes of the fathers unto the children, and to set up the tribes of Jacob
again. Blessed were they that saw the, and were garnysshed in love:

Eliah was covered in the storm, but Heliseus was filled with his mouth. While
he lived, he was afraid of no Prince, and no man might overcome him. There
could no word disceiue him, and after his death his body prophesied. He did
wonders in his life and i^ death were his works marvelous. For all this, the
people amended not, neither departed they from heyr sins, till they were
carried away prisoners out of the land, and were scatred abroad in all countries,
so that of them there remained but a very little people, and a Prince unto the
house of David. How be it some of them did right, and some heaped up
ungodliness.

Ezechias made his city strong, conveyed i. Par.xxxii. a
dug through the stony rock with iron, and made up a well by the water side.
In his time came Sennacherib up, and sent Rabsakeh, lift up his hand against
Syon, and defied them with great pride. Then trembled their hertes and hands,
so that they sorowed like a woman traueyling with child. So they called upon
the Lord which is mercyful, and lift up their hands before him. Immediately
the Lord herd the^ out of the heaven, and delivered them by the hand of Esaias.
He smote the host of the Assirians, and his angel destroyed them. For
Ezechias had done ye thing yt pleased the Lord, and remained steadfastly in the
way of David his father. Which Esaye was great and faithful in his visions. In
his time the sun went backwarde, and he lengthened the kings life. With a
right spirit prophesied he, what should come to pass at the last: and to
such as were sorrowful in Syon, he gave consolacyon, wherewith they might
comfort them selves for evermore. He showed things that were for to come and
secret, or ever they came to pass.

CAPI. XLIX.
THe remembrance of Josiah is like as iiii. Re.xxii. a xxiii.ii. pa.xxxiiii. a
His remembrance shall be sweet as honey in all mouths, and as the playing of
musyk by the wine. He was appointed to turn the people again, and to take
away all abhominacio^s of the ungodly. He directed his heart unto the Lord,
and in the time of the ungodly he set up the worship of God again. All kings
(except David, Ezechias and Josiah) committed wickedness: for even the kings
of Judah also forsook the law of God. For they gave their horn unto other,
their honor and worship also unto a strange people.

Therefore was the elect city of the Sanctuary bre^t with fire, iiii. Re.xxv. b
and the streets thereof lay desolate and waste: for they entreated Jeremy
evil, which nevertheless was a prophet ordained from his mothers womb, that
he might rote out, break of, and destroy, and that he might build up, and
plant again. Jeremy.i. a
Ezechiel saw the glory of the Lord in a vysion, which was showed him upon
the charet of the Cherubyns. For he thought upon the enemies in the rain, to
do good unto such as had ordered their ways aright. And the bones of the
twelve Prophets florysshe from out of their place, for they gave comfort and
consolacion unto Jacob, and delivered the^ faithfully. How shall we praise
Zorobabel, which was as a ring in the right hand? Agg.ii. a i. Esdr.iii. a

with their voices, so there was a pleasant noise in the great house of the

upon me on every side, so that I am not brent in the myddest of ye fire: From
the deep of hell, from an unclean tongue, from lying words, from the wicked king,
and from an vnrightous tongue. My soul shall praise the Lord unto death, for my
life drew nigh unto hell.



When I was yet but young, or ever I went astray, I desired wisdom openly in my
prayer I came therefore before the temple, and sought her unto the last. The^
florisshed she unto me as a grape that is sone ripe. My heart reioysed in her,
then went my foot the right way, yea from youth up, sought I after her: I bowed
down mine ear and received her. I found in me much wisdom, and prospered
greatly in her. Therefore will I ascribe the glory unto him that gives me
wisdom: for I am advised to do thereafter. I will be gelous to cleue unto the
thing that is good, so shall I not be confounded. My soul has wrestled with her,
and I have been dilligent to be occupied in her. I lift up mine hands on hye,
the^ was my soul lightened through wisdom, yt I knowleged my foolyshnesse, I
ordered my soul after her, she and I were one heart from the beginning, and I
found her in cle^nesse. And therefore shall I not be forsaken.

My heart longed after her, and I gat a good treasure. Through her the Lord
has given me a new tongue, wherewith I will praise him. O come unto me ye
unlearned, and dwell in ye house of wysdom: withdraw not your selves from her,
but talk and common of these things, for your souls are very thirstye. I
opened my mouth and spoke: O come and bye wisdom without money, how down your
neck under her yoke, and your soul shall receive wysdom. She is hard at hand,
and is content to be found. Behold with your eyes, how that I have had but
little labor, and yet have found much rest. O receive wisdom, and ye shall
have plenteousnesse of silver and gold in possession. Let your mind rejoice in
his mercy, and be not ashamed of his praise. Work his work bytymes, and he
shall give you your reward in due time.

Balthazar his son: that their days m^ye be upon earth, as the days of

live under the defense of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and under the
protection of Balthazar his son, that we may long do them service, and
find favor in their sight.

Pray for us also unto the Lord our God, or we have sinned against the Lord

Thus shall ye say: The Lord our God is Baruch.ii^ Daniel.ix. ^
but we are worthy of confusyon and shame: like as it is come to pass this
day unto all Judah, and to every one that dwells at Jerusalem: to our
Kings, Princes, priests, Prophets, and to our fathers. We have sinned
before the Lord our God, we have not put our trust in him, nor given him
credence, we have not obeyed him, we have not harkened unto the voice of the
Lord our God, to walk in the commandments that he gave us. Since the
day that he brought our fore fathers out of the land of Egypt unto this
present day we have been ever a mysbyleuynge, and an unfaithful people unto the
Lord our God: destroyinge our selves utterly, and shrynkynge back, that we
should not hear his voice.

Wherefore there are come upon us great plages and diverse curses, like as the
Lord Leu.xvi. Deuteronomy.xx^^
according to all the words of the Prophets whom he sent unto us, and unto
our rulers, but every man followed his own mind and wicked ymaginacion: to
offer unto strange gods, to do evil in the sight of the Lord our God.

The Jews confess that they suffer iustlye for their sins. The Lord will yt
we obey unto princes, although they be evil. He promyseth that he will call

And as for these plages that are come upon us alredye, the Lord had devised
them for us: yet would we not pray unto the Lord our God, that we might
every man turn from his ungodly ways. So the Lord has caused such plages
to come upon us, for he is rightous in all his works, which he has commanded
us, which we also have not done nor harkened unto his voice for to walk in the
commandments of the Lord, that he had given unto us.

And now, O Lord God of Israel, thou that have brought thy people out of the

A copye of the epistle that Ieremye sent unto the Jews, which were led away
prisoners by the king of Babylon: wherein he certyfyeth them of the thing that
was commanded him of God.

BEcause of the sins that ye have done Iere.xxv. a.b.
ye shall be led away captyue unto Babylon even of Nabuchodonosor the king of
Babylon. So when ye be come into Babylon, ye shall remain there many years and
for a long season: namely.vij. generacions: and after that will I bring you
away peaceably from thence. Now shall ye se in Babylon gods of gold, of
silver, of wood, and of stone: borne upon men's shoulders to cast out a
fearfulnes before the Hethen. But look that ye do not as the other: be not ye
afraid, and let not the fear of them over come you.

Therefore when ye se the multitude of people Deuter.vi.c
Mine aungel also shall be with you, and I my self will care for your souls. As
for the tymbre of those gods, the carpe^ter has polysshed them: yea gylted
be they, and laid over with silver, ye^ are they but vain things, and can
not speak. L^^e as a we^ch that loves pe^amours is trymlye dechte, even so are
these made and hanged with gold. Crowns of gold have their gods upon their
heedes: so the prestes them selves take the gold and silver from them, and put
it to their own uses: yea they give of the same unto harlots, and trymme their
hoores withal:
again, they take it from the hoores, and deck their gods therewith.
Ieremye.x. a
Yet can not these gods deliver them selves from rust and mothes. When they
have covered them with clothing of purple, they wype their faces for the dust
of the temple, whereof there is much among them. One has a scepter in his hand,
as though he were judge of the country: yet can he not slaye such as offend
him. An other has a swearde or an axe in his hand, for all that, is he
neither hable to defend him self from battle, nor from murderers.

By this ye may understand, that they Setting up of candels before ydolles.
(yea verily and that many) whereof they can not se one, but even as blocks, so
stand they in the temple. It is said: that the serpents and worms, which
come of the earth, gnawe out their hertes, eating them and their clothes also,
and yet they feel it not. Their faces are black, through the smoke that is in
the temple. The owls, swalowes, and birds fly upon them, yea and the cattes
run over their heedes.



The women sit before the gods of silver, gold, and wod, and the prestes sit
in their temples, having open clothes, whose heads and berdes are shaven and
have nothing upon their heads: rorynge and crying upon their gods, as men
do at the feast, when one is deed.

The prestes also take away the garments Eccle.v. a
they will not require it. They can not restore a blind man to his sight, ne
help any at his need. They can show no mercy to the wydow, nor do good to
the fatherles. Their gods of wod stone, gold and silver, are but even as
other stones, that be hewn of the mountain. They that worship them shall be
confounded. How should they then be taken for gods? yea how dare men call
them gods? And though the Caldees worshypped them not, hearing that they
were but dom and could not speak: Yet they them selves offer unto Bell, and
would feign have him to speak: as who say, they could feel, that may not
move. But when these men come to understanding, they shall forsake the^, for
their gods have no feeling.

For like as a frayboggarde in a garden of cucumbers keeps nothing, even so
are their gods of wod, of silver and gold: and like as a white thorn in an

in ye datke: Eue^ so is it with those gods of wod, silver and gold. By the
purple and scarlet which they have upon them, and soon fades away, ye may
understand, that they be no gods: yea they them selves shall be consumed at

unto thy servants and to them that worship the. Jeremy.ii. b

all the world, because of our sins: So that now we have neither prince
duke, prophet, burntoffrynge, sacryfice, oblacyon, incense, ne Sanctuarye
before the.

Nevertheless, in a contryte heart and an humble spirit let us be received
that we may obtain thy mercy. Like as in sacryfyce of rams and bullockes,
and in thousands of fat lambs: i. Pet.ii. a Roma x.c Esaias.xxviii. d Roma.ix. g
so let our offering be in thy sight this day, that it may please the. for
there is no confusion unto the^ that put their trust in ye. And now we follow
the with all our heart we fear the. and seek thy face. Put us not to shame,
but deal with us after thy loving kyndnesse, and according to the multitude
of thy mercyes. Deliver us by thy miracles (O Lord) and get thy name an
honor: that all they which do thy servants evil, may be confounded. Let
them be ashamed through thy almyghtye power, and let their strength be broken:
that that they may know, how that thou only art the Lord God, and glorious
thorowout all the world.

And the kings servants that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot,
with wild fire, dry straw, pythe and fagottes: so that the flame brast forth
of the oven upon a forty and nine cubytes, yea it took away, and brent up
those Caldees that it gat hold upon beside the oven. But the Aungel of the
Lord came down in to the oven to Asaria and his fellows, and smote the flame
of the fire out of the oven, and made the myddest of the oven, as it had been a
cold wind blowyng, so that the fire neither touched them, grieved them, ne did
them hurt. Then these three (as out of one mouth) praised, honored, and

THE HISTORYE OF SUSANNA WHICH IS THE.XIII. CHAP. OF DANYEL AFTER THE LATYNE.




When they returned again, they came together, enquerynge out ye matter
between them selves, yea the one told the other of his wicked lust. Then
appointed they a time when they might take Susanna alone.

It happened also that they espied out a (...)
So she said to her maidens: go fet me oil and soap, and shut the orcharde
door, that I may wash me. And they did as she bad them, and shut the orchard
door, and went out them selves at a back door, to set the thing that she had
commanded: but Susanna knew not. that the elders lay there hyd within. Now
when ye maidens were gone forth, the two elders gat them up: and ran upon her,
saying: now the orcharde doors are shut, that no man can se us: we have a lust
un to the, therefore consent unto us. and lie with us.



These two elders stood up in the myddest of the people, and laid their hands
upon the head of Susanna: Leuit.xxiiii.c
which wept and looked up toward heaven, for her heart had a sure trust in the
Lord. And the elders said: As we were walking in the orcharde alone, this
woman came in with her two maidens whom she sent away from her, and sparred
the orcharde doors. With that a young fellow (which there was hid) came unto
her, and lay with her. As for us, we stood in a corner of ye orcharde. And
when we saw this wyckednes we ran to her: and perceived, that they had

did any such things, as these men have malyciously inverted against me. And
the Lord herd her voice. For when she was led forth to death, the Lord
raised up the sprete of a young child, whose name was Daniel, which cried with
a loud vyyce: ii. Reg.iii. ^ ^et.xx. d
and said: What mean these words, yt thou have spoken? Daniel stood in the
midst of them, and said: Are ye such fools, O ye children of Israel, yt ye
can not discern? Ye have here condemned a daughter of Israel unto death, and
know not ye truth wherefore: Go sit on judgment again, for they have spoken
false witness against her.

Wherefore the people turned again in all yt haste. And the elders (that is the
principal heedes) said unto him: come sit down here among us, and show us
this matter, seeing God has given the as great honor as an elder. ii.
Reg.iii. d
And Daniel said unto them. Put these two aside one from an other, and then
shall I hear them. When they were put a sunder one from an other, he called one
of them, and said unto him: O thou old canckerde carle, that have used thy
wickedness so long: thine ungracious deeds, which thou have done before, are
now come to light. For thou have given false judgments, thou have oppressed
the innocent, and letten the gyltye go free, where as yet the Lord says:
Exodi xxiii. a Prove.xvii.c
The innocent and ryghtous se thou slaye not. Well than if thou have seen her,
tell me under what tree saw thou them talkyng together? He answered: Under a
Molbery tree. And Daniel said: very well, now thou lie even upon thine
heed. Lo the messenger of the Lord has received the sentence of him, to cut
the in two. Then put he him aside, and called for the other, and said unto him:
O thou sede of Canaan, but not of Judah: Fayrnesse has disceyued the, and lust
has subverted thine heart. Thus dealte ye before with the daughters of Israel,
and they (for fear) consented unto you: but the daughter of Judah would not
abide your wickedness. Now tell me the^ under what tree dyddest thou take
them, speaking together? He answered: Under a Pomgranete tree. Then said
Daniel unto him: Very well, now thou lie also even upon thine heed. The
messenger of the Lord stands waiting with the sword to cut the in two, and
to slaye you both.

With that, all the hole multitude gave a great shout, and praised God, which
always delyuereth them that put their trust in him. And they came upon the two
elders (whom Daniel had conuyct with their own mouth: Psalm.xvii. a
yt they had given false witness) and dealte with them, Deute.xix. d
Prouer.xix. a
even likewise as they would have done with their neyghbouresse: yea they did
according to ye law of Moses, and put them to death. Thus ye innocent blood was
saved ye same day. Then Helchias and his wife praised God, for their daughter
Susanna, with Ioachim her husband and all the kynred: that there was no
dishonestie found in her. From that day forth, was Daniel had in great
reputacyon in the sight of the people.

The king said unto him: think thou not that Bell is a living God? Or seyst
thou not, how much he eats and drynketh every day? Daniel smyled and said:
O king disceyue not thy self: this is but made of claye with in, and of
metal without, neither eats he ever any thing. Eccl.xxx.c
Then the king was wroth and called for his prestes, and said unto them:
Leuiti.xx^
then Daniel shall dye, for he has spoken blasphemy against Bell. And Daniel
said unto the king let it so be, even as thou have said. The prestes of Bell
were.lxx. beside their wives and children. And the king went with Daniel in to
the temple of Bell. So Bells prestes said: Lo we will go out and set thou the
meat there (O king) and pour in the wine: then shut the door fast, and seal
it with thine own sygnet: and to morrow when thou come in, if thou fyndest
not, that Bell has eaten up all, we will suffer death: or else Daniel, that has
lied upon us. The prestes thought the^ selves sure enough, for under the altar
they had made a preuy intraunce, and there went they in ever, and ate up what
there was.

So when they were gone forth, the king set meats before Bell. Now Daniel had
commanded his servants to bring ashes and these be syfted thorowout all
the temple, that the king might se. Then went they out, and sparred the door,
sealynge it with ye kings sygnet, and so departed. In the night came the
prestes with their wives and children (as they were wont to do) and ate and
drunk up all. In the morning be times at the break of the day, the king
arose, and Daniel with him. And the king said: Daniel are the seals hole yet?
He answered: Yea O king, they be hole. Now as soon as he had opened the door,
the king looked unto the altar, and cried with a loud voice: Great art thou
O Bell, and with the is no disceite. Then laughed Daniel, and held the king,
that he should not go in, and said: Behold the pauement, mark well, whose foot
steps are these? The king said I se ye footsteps of men, women and

And in that same place was a great dragon which they of Babylon worshipped.
And the king said unto Daniel: say thou, this is but a God of metal also? lo
he lives, he eats and drynketh, so that thou can not say that he is no
living God, therefore worship him. (...).c
Daniel said to ye king: I will worship the Lord my God, he is the true living
God: surely this is not the God of life. But give me leave, o king, and I shall
destroy this dragon without swerd or staff. The king said I give the leave.
Then Daniel took pitch, fat and heery woll, and did sethe them together and
made lompes thereof: this he put in the dragons mouth, and so the dragon brast
in sonder: and Daniel said: lo, here is he who^ ye worshipped. When they of
Babylon herd (...)
When the king saw, that they russhed in so sore upon him, and that necessity
constrained him, he delivered Daniel unto them, which cast him in to the lions

every day two bodies, and two sheep, which then were not given them, to
the intent they might devour Daniel.

Babylon upon the den. And Abacuc cried, saying: O Daniel you servant of God,

thought upon me? well, thou never faylest them that love the. So Daniel arose,
and ate: and the angel of the Lord set Abacuc in his own place again
forthwith.

Upon the seventh day, the king went to Iere.xxxvii. d Hester.vii. b Dani.vi.c
and he drew him out of the den. Then those yt were the cause of his
destruction he did cast in to the den, and they were straight devoured before
his face. After this wrote the king unto all people, kynredes and tunges, that
dwelte in all countries, saying: peax be multiplied with you. My commandment
is, in all the dominion of my realm, that men fear and stand in awe of
Daniels God, Dani.vi.c Luke.i.c Esaye.xliii. b Osee.xiii. b Daniel.iii. ^
for he is the living God, which endures ever: his kingdom abides
incorrupt, and his power is everlasting. It is he that can deliver and save:
he does wonders and marvelous works in heaven and in earth, for he has saved
Daniel from the power of the Lions.

THE FIRST BOOK OF THE MACHABEES.
After the death of Alexander king of Macedodonia, Antiochus takes the
kingdom. Many of the children of Israel make couenaunte with the Gentyles.
Antiochus subdueth Egypt and Jerusalem. Jerusalem being burnt makes laws of
her own, and forbyddeth to keep Gods laws. Antiochus sets up an Idol over
the altar of God.

CAPI. I.
AFter that Alexander Daniel. ^ and.viii* ^
and then dyed.

After his death fell the kingdom unto his princes, and they obtained it every
one in his rowme, and caused the^ selves to be crowned as kings: and so did
their children after the^ many years, and much wickedness increased in the
world. i. Mat.v^
Out of these came the ungracious rote, noble Antiochus, the son of Antiochus
ye king (which had be^ a pledge at Rome) and he raygned in the.Cxxxvij. year
of the reign of the Greeks.

In those days went there out of Israel wicked men, which moved much
people

So when Antiochus began to be mighty in his kingdom, he went about to
obteyn the land of Egypt also, that he might have the domynion of two realms.
Upon this entered he in to Egypt with a strong boste, with charettes,
elephantes, horsemen, and a great nombre of ships, and began to war against
Ptolomy the king of Egypt. But Ptolomy was afraid of him, and fled: and many
of his people were wounded to death. Thus Antiochus wan many strong cities, and
took away great good out of the land of Egypt.



Thus arose great heaviness and misery in all ye land of Israel. The princes
and elders of the people mourned, the young men and the maids were defiled, and
the fair beautye of women was changed: the brydegrome and the bryde took them
to mourning: the land and those that dwelte therein was moved, for all the
house of Jacob was brought to naught.

(...).v. ^
which came to Jerusalem with a great multitude of people, speaking
peaceable words unto them, but all was disceyte: for when they had given him
credence, he fell suddenly upon the city, and smote it sore, and destroyed much
people of Israel. (...).c
And when he had spoiled the city, he set fire on it, casting down houses
and walls on every side. The women and their children took they captyue, (...)
and led away their catel. Then builded they the castle of David with a
great and thycke wall, (...)
and with mighty towers, and made it a strong hold for them. Beside all this,
they set wicked people, and ungodly men to keep it, stored it with weapons and
vitayles, gathered the goods of Jerusalem, and laid them up there: thus became
it a theuish castle.

And this was done to lay wait for ye people that went in to the Sanctuarye,
and for the cruel destruction of Israel. Thus they shed innocent blood on
every side of the sanctuary, and defiled it: In so much that the cityzins were
feign to depart, and the city became an habitacion of strangers, being
desolate of her own seed, for her own natives were feign to leave her. Her
Sanctuary was clean wasted, her holy days were turned in to mournyng, (...). b
her Sabothes were had in derision, and her honor brought to naught. Look how
great her glory was before, so great was her confusion, and her joy turned in to
sorrow.

Antiochus also the king sent out a commission ii. Math.vi. a
that all the people should be one. Then they left every man his law, and all
the Heathen agreed to the commandment of king Antiochus: Yea, many of the
Israelytes consented thereunto, offering unto ydols, and defilinge the Saboth. So
the king Antiochus sent his messengers with his commyssyon unto Jerusalem, and
to all the cities of Judah, that they should follow the laws of the Heathen,
and forbade either burntoffring, meatofferyng or peaceofferynge to be made in
the temple of God, and that there should no Saboth ne hye feast day be kept:
but commanded yt the Sanctuary, and the holy people of Israel should be
defiled.

He commanded also there should be set up other aulters, temples and ydols: to
offer up swynes flesh and other unclean beasts, that men should leave their
children uncircumcised, to defyle their souls with all manner of uncleanness
and abhominacio^s, yt they might so forget the law, and change all the holy
ordinances of God: and yt who so ever would not do according to the
commandment of king Antiochus, should suffer death: In like manner commanded
he through out all his realm, and set rulers over the people, for to compel
them to do these things, commaundynge the cities of Judah to do sacrifyce unto
ydolles.

Then went the people unto the Heathen by heaps, forsook the law of the Lord,
and committed much evil in the land: yea and chased out the secret Israelites,
which had hyd the^ selves in corners and privy places. The xv. day of the
month Casleu, in the.Cxlv. Iere.xxxvi. ^
And the books of the law of God, they brent them in ye fire, and rent them in
pieces. What so ever he was that had a book of the testament of the Lord found
by him: yea who so ever endeavored him self to keep the law of the Lord, the
kings commandment was, that they should put him to death. And through his
authority they executed these things every month, upon the people of Israel
that were found in the cities.

The five and twenty day of the month what time as they did sacrifice upon
the alter i. Match.vi. b
they put certain women to death, which had caused their children to be
circumcised: Not only that, but they hanged up the children by the necks
through out all their houses, and slew the circumcisers of them.

Yet were there many of the people of Israel which determined in them selves,
that they would not eat unclean things, but chose rather to suffer death, the^
to be defiled with unclean meats. So because they would not break the blessed
law of God, they were cruelly slain. And this great tyranny increased very
sore upon the people of Israel.

The mournyng of Mathathiah and his sons, for the destruction of the holy
city. They refuse to do sacrifyce unto Idols. The zele of Mathathiah for the
law of God. They are slain and will not fight again because of the Sabbath
day. Mathathiah dyinge commands his sons to stycke by the word of God,
after the exemple of the fathers.

CAPI. II.
i. Math.i. b
Her Sanctuary is come in to the power of strangers, her temple is as it were
a man yt has lost his good name. Her precious ornaments are carried away
captyue, her old me^ are slain in the streets and her young men are fallen
through yt swerd of the enemies.

What people is it that has not some possession in her kingdom? Or who has
not gotten some of her spoils? All her glory is taken away. She was a queen,
and now she is become an handmayde. Behold our Sanctuarye, our beauty and
honor is wasted away, and defiled by the Gentyles. What helps it us the^
to live? And Mathathiah rent his clothes and his sons, and put sackeclothe
upon them, and mourned very sore.

Then came the men thither which were

Mathathiah answered and spoke with a loud voice: Though all nations obey
the king Antiochus, and fall away every man from keeping the law of their
fathers: though they consent to his commandments, yet will I and my sons
and my brethren, not fall from the law of our fathers. God forbid we should,
that were not good for us, yt we should forsake the law and ordinances of God,
and to agree unto the commandment of king Antiochus. Therefore we will do no
such sacrifice, neither break ye statutes of our law, to go an other way.
And when he had spoken these words, there came one of the Jews, which openly
in the sight of all, did sacrifice unto the ydols upon the altar in the city
of Modyn, according to the kings commandment.

When Mathathiah saw this, it grieved him at the heart, so that his raynes shoke
withal,
and killed the Jew beside the altar: yea and slew the kings commissioner,
that compelled him to do sacrifice, and destroyed the altar at the same time,
such a zele had he unto the law of God, like as Phinebes did unto Zambry ye
son of Salomi. Nun.xx^
And Mathathiah cried with a loud voice through the city, saying: Who so is
fervent in the law, ii. Match. ^^
and will keep the covenant, let him follow me. So he and his sons fled in to
the mountains, and left all that ever they had in the city. Many other godly
men also departed in to the wilderness with their children, their wives and
their catel, and remained there, the tyranny increased so sore upon them.

Now when the kings servants and Iosue.i.c
Then began they to fight against them, nevertheless they gave them none other
answer, neither cast they one stone at them, nor made fast their privy
places, but said: We will dye all in our innocence, heaven and earth shall testify
with us, that ye put us to death wrongouslye. Thus they fought against them
upon the Saboth, and slew both men and catell, their wives and their children,
to the nombre of a thousand people.

When Mathathiah and his friends herd this, they mourned for them right sore,
and is upon the Saboth day, we will fight against him, and not dye al, as our
brethren, yt were murdered so heynously. Upon this came the Synagoge of ye
Jews unto the^, strong men of Israel, all such as were fervent in the law.
And all they that were fled for persecucion, came to help them, and to stand
by them: In so much that they gathered an host of men, and slew the wicked
doers in their gelousy, and the ungodly me^ in their wrath. Some of the wicked
fled unto the Heathen, and escaped.

Thus Mathathias and his friends went about, and destroyed the aulters, and
circumcised the children, that had not yet received circumcision: as many as
they found within the coostes of Israel: and followed myghtylye upon the
children of pride, and this act prospered in their hands: In so much that
they kept the law against the power of the Gentyles and the kings, and gave
not over their domynyon unto wicked doers.

^hias (...) his (...)
should dye, he said unto his sons: Now is pride and persecucion increa? sed:
now is the time of destruction and wrathful displeasure: wherefore (o my sons)
be ye fervent in the law, and ieopard your lives for the testament of the
fathers: call to remembrance what acts our fathers did in their time, so
shall ye receive great honor, and an everlasting name.

Remember Abraham, was not he found faithful in temptacion, (...) ii c (...) d
(...) ^xii. a (...) f (...) xv.c
and it was reckened unto him: for rightousnes? Joseph in time of his trouble,
kept the commandment, and was made a lord of Egypt. Phinehes our father

everlasting preesthode. (...) vii. d (...) ^iii. a
Iosue for fulfyllynge the word of God, was made the captain of Israel.
Caleb bare record before the congregation, and received an heritage. David

fervent in the law, (...) ii
was taken up in to heaven. Hananias Asarias and Misael, remained steadfast in
faith, (...) d
and were delivered out of the fire. In like manner Daniel being unguilty, (...)
was saved from the mouth of the lions.

And thus ye may consydre thorowout all (...)

^iii. b (...) ^vi.c
for his glory is but dong and worms: to day is he set up, and to morrow is

Wherefore, o my sons, take good hertes unto you, and quyte your selves like
men in the law: for if ye do the things that are commanded you in the law of
the Lord your God, ye shall obteyn great honor therein.

And behold, I know that your brother Simon is a man of wisdom, se that ye give
ear unto him always, he shall be a father unto you As for Judas Machabeus, he
has ever been mighty and strong, from his youth up: let him be your capiteyn,
and order the batell of ye people: thus shall ye bring unto you al those that
favor the law, and se ye avenge ye wrong of your people, and recompense the
Heathen again, and apply your selves hole to the commandment of the law. So
he gave them his blessing, and was laid by his fathers: and died in the.C.
and.xlvi. year at Modin, where his sons buried him in his fathers sepulcre,
and all Israel made great lamentacion for him.

Judas is made ruler over the Jews. He kylleth Appolonius and Seron the prince
of Syria. The confydence of Judas toward God. Judas determyneth to fight
against Lisias, whom Antiochus had made captain over his host. The prayer of
the abstayners.

CAPI. III.
THen stood up Judas Machabeus in his fathers stead, and all his brethren
helped Judas. Josephus cap.viii.ix.li.xii. Antiq.
and so did al they that held with his father, and fought with cherefulnesse
for Israel. So Judas gat his people great honor: he put on a brestplate as a
giaunt, and arrayed him self with his harness, and defended the host with his
sword. In his acts he was like a lion, and as a lions whelp roryng at his
pray. He was an enemy to the wicked, Psalm.c. b ii. Match.viii.
and hunted them out, and brent up those that vexed his people: so that his
enemies fled for fear of him, and all the workers of ungodliness were put to
trouble, such luck and prosperity was in his hand. This grieved diverse
kings, but Jacob was greatly reioysed through his acts, and he gat him self a
great name for ever.

He went through the cities of Judah, destroying the ungodly out of them, turning
away the wrath from Israel, and receyuyng such as were oppressed: and the fame
of him went unto the uttermost part of the earth. Then Appollonius Apollonius.
(a prince of Siria) gathered a mighty great host of the Heathen, and out of
Samaria, to fight against Israel, which when Judas perceived, he went forth to
mete him, fought with him, slew him, and a great multitude with him: the
remnaunte fled, and he took their substance. Judas also took Appolonius own
sword, and fought with it all his life long.

Now when Seron (an other prince of Siria) herd say, that Judas had gathered
unto him the congregation and church of the faithful, he said: I will get me a
name and a praise through out the realm, for I will go fight with Judas, and
them that are with him, as many as have despised the kings commandment. So
he made him redye, and there went with him a great mighty host of the
ungodly to stand by him, and to be avenged of the children of Israel. And
when they came nigh unto Bethoron, Judas went forth against them with a small
company. And when his people saw such a great host before them, they said
unto Judas: How are we hable (being so few) to fight against so great a
multitude and so strong? seeing we be so weary, and have fasted all this day.

But Judas said: It is a small matter for many to be overcome with few: i.
Reg.xiiii. a
yea there is no difference to the God of heaven, to deliver by a great
multitude or by a small company: for the victory of the battle stands not in
the multitude of the host, ii. Para.xxv. b
but the strength

As soon as he had spoken these words, he lept suddenly upon them. Thus was
Seron Seron
smytten, and his host put to flight, and Judas followed upon them beyond
Bethoron unto the plain feld, where there were slain eight hundred men of
them, and the resydue fled in to the land of the Philistines. Then all the
Heathen on every side were afraid for Judas and his brethren: so that the
rumor of him came unto the kings ears, for all the Gentyles could tell of
the wars of Judas.



Nevertheless when he saw that there was not money enough in his treasuryes,
and that through the discord and persecucion, which he made in the land (to
put down the laws that had been of old times) his customs and trybutes of
the land were mynysshed: he feared that he was not hable for to bear the
costs and charges any longer, nor to have such gifts, to give so lyberally
as he did before, more then the kings that were before him.

i. Matha.vi. a
Wherefore he was heavy in his mind, and thought to go in to Persides for to take
tributes of ye land, and so to gather much money. So he left Lysias (a noble
man of the kings blood) to ouerse the kings businesses, Lisias.
from the water Euphrates, unto ye borders of Egypt, and to keep well his son
Antiochus, till he came again.

Moreover he gave him half of his host, Iosep. (...).xii. (...)
and departed from Andtioh (a city of his realm) over the water of Euphrates,
in the hundred and.xlvij. year, and went t^orowe the high countries.

And Lysias chose unto him Ptolomy the son of Dorminus, Nicanor, ii. Ma.xv^
and Gorgias mighty men, and the kings friends. These he sent with.xl.
thousand fo^temen, and.vij. thousand horsemen, for to ^o in to the land of
Judah, and to destroy it, as the king commanded. So they went forth with all
their power, and came to Emmaus in to the plain field. When the marchaunt^s
herd the rumor of them, they and their servants took very much silver and
gold, for to bie the children of Israel to be their bon^emen. There came unto
them also yet moo ^en of war on every side, out of Syria, and from the
Palestines.

Now when Judas and his ^rethren saw

As for Jerusalem, it lay void, and was as it had been a wilderness. i.
Math.i. d
There went no man in nor out at it, and the Sanctuarye was trodden down. The
alcauntes kept the castle there was the habitacion of the Heathen. The mirth of
Jacob was taken away, the pype and the harp was gone from among them.

The Israelytes gathered them together, and came to Maspha before Jerusalem: i.
Regu^.xii b
For in Maspha was the place where they prayed before time. So they fasted that
day, and put sackeclothes upon them, cast ashes upon their heads, rent
their clothes, and laid forth the books of the law (whereoute the Heathen
sought the likeness of their images (and brought the Priests ornaments the
firstlinges and the tithes. They set there also the abstayners (which had
fulfilled their days) before God, Nume.vi. ^
and cried with a loud voice toward heaven, saying: What shall we do with
these? and whyther shall we carye them away? For the Sanctuarye is trodden
down and defiled, thy priests

They blewe out the trompet also with a loud voice, Exodi.xviii. d
Then Judas ordained Capytaynes over the people: over thousa^des, over
hundredes, over fyftye, and over ten. But as for such as builded them houses,
married wives, pl^nted them vyneyardes, and those that were fearful: he
commanded them every man to go home, according to the law. So the host
removed, (...)
and pytched upon the southsyde of Emmaus.

And Judas said: Arm your selves, be strong (O my children) make you ready
against to morrow in the morning, that ye may fight with these people, which
are agreed together to destroy us and our sanctuarye. Better is it for us to
dye in battle, then to se our people and our sanctuary in such a myrable
case. (...).xl. b (...)
Nevertheless, as the will is in heaven, so be it.

Judas goes against Gorgias, which lies in wait. He puts Gorgias and his
host to flight. Lisias inuadeth Iewrye, but Judas dryueth him out. Judas
purifyeth the temple, and dedycateth the altar.

CAPI. IIII.


But on the other side, they saw that the Heythen were mighty and well
harnessed, and their horsemen about them, and all these well expert in feats
of war. (...)
Then said Judas to the men that were with him: Fear not ye the multitude of
them, be not afraid of their vyolente runnynge: remember how our fathers
were delivered in the reed see, when Pharao threatened them with a great host.
(...)
Even so let us also cry now toward heaven: and the Lord shall have mercy
upon us* and remember the covenant of our fathers, yea and destroy this host
before our face this day: And all the Heythen shall know that it is God him
self, which delivers and saves Israel.

(...) viii. d
and the Heythen were discomfyted, and fled over the plain field: but the
hynmost of them were slain. For they followed upon them unto Assaremoth, and
in to the feldes of Idumea, toward Azot and Iamnia: so that there were slain
of them upon a three thousand men. So Judas turned again with his host, and
said unto the people: Be not gredy of the spoils, we have yet a battle to
fight: for Gorgias and his host are here by us in the mountains, but stand
ye fast against our enemies, and overcome them: then may ye safely take the
spoils.

As Judas was speaking these words, there appeared one part of them upon the
mount. But when Gorgias saw that they of his party were fled, and the tents
burnt up (for by the smoke they might understand what was done) they
perceiving this, were very sore afraid: an when they saw also that Judas and
his host were in the field ready to stryke battle, they fled euerychone in
to the land of the heathen.

So Judas turned again to spoil the te^tes, where they gat much gold and
silver, precious stones, purple, and great riches* thus they went home and
song a Psalm of thankesgeuynge and praised God in heaven for he is gracyous,
and his mercy endures for ever: Psa.cvii. Psalm.cxviii. a
And so Israel had a great vyctorye in that day.

Now all the heathen that escaped, came and told Lisias every thing as it
happened. Wherefore Lisias was sore afraid and grieved in his mind, because
Israel had not gotten such mysfortune as he would they should neither as the
king commanded. The next year following, gathered Lisias Lisias.
three score thousand chosen men, of foot, and five thousand horsemen to fight
against them.

So they came in so Iewrye, and pitched i. Regu^.vii. g
in the hand of thy servant David, iiii. Re.xiiii. b
and gave the host of the heathen into the hand of Ionathas (the son of
Saul) and of his weapon bearer.

Put this host now into the hand of thy people of Israel, and let them be
confounded in their multitude of horsemen. Make them afraid, and dicomfort the
boldness of their strength, that they may be moved through ^h^ir destruction.
Cast them down through the swearde of thy lovers, then shall al they that

So they stroke the battle, and there were slain of Lisias host, five
thousand men. Then Lisias seeing the discomfetynge of his men, and the manlynes
of the Jews, how they were ready, either to live or to dye like men: He went
unto Antioch and chose out men of war: that when they were gathered
together, they might come again in to Iewry. Then said Judas and his
brethren: behold our enemies are discomfeted: Let us now go up, The
Sanctuary is repaired.
to cleanse and repair the Sa^ctuarye.

Upon this all the hooste gathered them ii. Ma.x. a
Now when they saw the Sanctuary laid waste, the altar defiled, the doors
brent up, the shrubbes growyng in the courts, like as in a wod, or upon
mountains, yea and that the prestes Celles were broken down: They rent their
clothes, made great lamentacyon, cast ashes upon their heedes, fell down flat
to the ground, made a great noise with the trompettes, and cried toward
heaven.

Then Judas appointed certain men to fight against those which were in the
castle, till they had cleansed the Sanctuary. So he chose prestes that were
undefiled, such as had pleasure in the law of God: and they cleansed the
Sanctuary, and bare out the defiled stones, in to an unclean place. And for
somoche as the altar of burntoffrynges was unhallowed, he took aduysement, what
he might do with all: so he thought it was best to destroy it (leest it
should happen to do the^ any shame) for the Heythen had defiled it, and
therefore they brake it down. As for the stones they laid them up upon the
mountain, by the house in a conuenyent place: til there came a prophet to
show, what should be done with them.

and builded a new altar, such one as was before, and made up the Sanctuary
within and without, and hallowed the courts. They made new ornaments, and
brought the candelsticke, the altar of incense, and the table in to the
temple. The ince^se laid they upon the altar, and lyghted the la^pes which
were upon the candelstycke, that they might burn in the temple. They set the
shewbreed upon the table, and hanged up the vale, and set up the temple as it
was before. And upon the.xxv. day of the nynth month, which is called the

sacrifyce (according to the law upon, the new burntoffryng altar, that they
had made: after the time and season that the Heithen had defiled it. The same
day was it set up again, with songs, pypes, harpes, and cymbales.

And all the people fell upon their faces, ii. Para.vii. d

because ye blasphemye of the Heithe^ was put away. So Judas and his brethren
with the hole co^gregacyon of Israel, ordained that the time of the dedycacyon of
ye altar should be kept in his season, John.x.c
from year to year, by the space of eight days, from the twenty and fyfth
day of the month Casleu: yea and that with mirth and gladness.

And at the same time builded they up the mount Syon, with high walls and
strong towers round about: lest the Gentyles should come and tread it down, ^

as they did before. Therefore Judas set men of war in it, to keep it: and made
it strong, for to defend Bethsura: that the people might have a refuge against
the Edomites.

Judas vaynquysshed the heathen that go about to destroy Israel, and is helped
of his brethren Simon and Ionathas. He overthrows the city of Ephron,
because they denied him passage through it.

IT happened also that when the Heathen Joseph. (...) xii.libro.xii
how that the altar and the Sa^ctuary were set up in their old estate: it
displeased them very sore wherefore they thought to destroy the generation of
Jacob that was among them: In so much that they began to slaye and to
persecute certain of the people. Then Judas fought against the children of
Esau in Idumea, Ezech.xxv.c and.xxxv. a
and against those which were at Arabathane (for they dwelt round about the
Israelites) where he slew and spoiled a great multitude of them. ii. Math x.c
He thought also upon the malice and unfaithfulness of the children of Bean,
how they were a snare and stop unto the people, an how they laid wait for
them in the high way wherefore he shut them up in to towers, and came unto
them, condemned them, and brent up their towers with all that were in them.

After ward went he against the children of Ammon, whereof he found a mighty
power, and a great multitude of people, with Timothy their captain. So he
stroke many battayles with them, which were destroyed before him. And when he
had slain them, he wan Gazer the city, with the towns belo^gyng thereto, and
so turned again into Iewry. The Heathen also in Galaad gathered them together,
against the Israelytes that were in their quarters to slay them: but they fled
to the castle of Datheman, and sent letters unto Judas and his brethren,
saying: The heathen are gathered against us on every

While these letters were yet a reading, behold, there came other messengers
from Galile, with rent clothes, which told even the same tidings, and
said, that they of Ptolomaus, of Tirus and of Sidon were gathered against
them, and that all Galylee was filled with enemies to destroy Israel. When
Judas and the people herd this, they came together (a great congragacyon) to
deuyse, what they might do for their brethren, that were in trouble and
besieged of their enemies. And Judas said unto Simon his brother: chose the out
certain men, and go deliver thy brethrn in Galilee: As for me and my brother
Ionathas, we will go in to Galaadithim. So he left Josephus the son of
Zacharye, and Asarias to be Captains of the people, and to keep the remnaunt
of the host in Iewrye, and commanded them, saying: Take the ouersyght of
this people, and se that ye make no war against the Heythen, until the time
that we come again. And unto Simon he gave three thousand men, for to go into
Galilee, but Judas him self had eight thousand in Galaadithim.



So Judas and his boost turned in all the haste in the wilderness toward
Bosor, and wan the city, slew all the males with the swearde, took all their
goods, and set fire upon the city. And in the night they took their iourneye
from thence, and came to the castle. And bytymes in the morning when they
looked up, behold, there was an innumerable people, bearing laders and other
instruments of war, to take the castle and to overcome them.

When Judas saw that the battle began, and that the noise thereof went up
and range in to the heaven, and that there was so great a cry in the city: He
said unto his host: fight this day for your brethren. And so came behind their
enemies in three companies, and blew the trompettes, and cried in their prayer
to God.

But as soon as Timothis host perceived that Machabeus was there, they fled
from him, and the other slew them down right sore: so that there were killed
of them that same day, almost eight thousand men. Then departed Judas unto
Maspha, laid siege unto it and wan it, slew all the males in it, spoiled it,
and set fire upon it. From thence

After this gathered Tymothy an other booste, which pitched their tents before
Raphon beyond, the water. Judas sent to spy the host, and they brought him
word again saying: All the heathen that be round about us, are gatherd unto
him, and the boost is very great: Yea they have hired the Arabians to help
them, and have pitched tents beyond the water, and are ready to come and fight
against the. So Judas went on to mete them.

And Timothy said unto the captains of his host: when Judas and his host
come nygh the river: if he go over first, we shall not be hable to withstand
him: for why, he will be to strong for us. But if he dare not come over so
that he pitch his sent beyond the water: then will we go over, for we shall
be strong enough against him. Now as soon as Judas came to the river he
appointed certain scrybes of the people, and commanded them, saying: se that
ye leave none behind upon this side of ye river, but let every man come to the
battle. So he went first over unto them and his people after him.

And all the heathen were discomfeted before him, and let their weapons fall,
and ran in to the temple that was at Carnaim. Carnaim
Which city Judas wan, and brent the temple with all that were in it: So was
Carnaim subdued and might not withstand Judas. Then Judas gathered all the
Israelites that were in Galaadithim, from the leest unto the most, with their
wives and their children (a very great host) for to come in to the land of
Israel.

So they came unto Ephron, which was

Wherefore Judas commanded a proclaymacion to be made through out the host, that
every man should keep his order: and so they did their best like valiant men.

And Judas besieged the cyty all that day and all that night, and so wan it:
where they slew as many as were males, and destroyed the city and spoiled
it, and went through all the city over them that were slain. Then went they
over Jordan into the plain field before Bethsan. And Judas helped those
froward that came behind, and gave the people good exhortacion all the way
through till they were come in to their land of Judah. Thus they went up unto ye
mount Sion, where they offered with mirth and thankesgeuyng: because there were
none of them slain, but came home again peaceably.

Now what time as Judas and Ionathas were in the land of Galaad, and Simon

were stricken, Presumptuous persons
said: Let up get us a name also, and go fight against the Heythen that are
round about us.



After this went Judas forth with his brethren, and fought against the
children of Esau, in the land that lies toward the south where he wanne the
city of Hebron, and the towns that lie beside it: and as for the walls and
towers round about it, he bre^t them up. Then removed he to go in to the land
of the Philistines, and went through Samaria. At the same time were there many
prestes slain in ye battle,
which wylfully and without aduysement went out for to fight to get them honor.
And when Judas came to Azot in the Philistines land, he brake down their
altares, bre^t the images of their Idols, spoiled the cities, and came again
in to the land of Judah.

Josephus cap.xiii.libr.xii. Antiq.
NOw when king Antyochus trauayled through the high countries, he herd yt
Elymas in Persia was a noble and ple^teous cytte in silver and gold, and that
there was in it a very rich temple: where as were clothes, cote armoures, and
shyldes of gold, which Alexander the son of Philip king of Macedonia had
left behind him. Wherefore he went about to take the city and to spoil it,
but he was not able: for the cytezins were warned of it, and fought with him.
And so he fled and departed with great heaviness, and came again in to
Babylon. More over there came one which brought him tidings to Persyde, that
his hoostes which were in ye land of Judah, i. Mocha.iii.c and.iiii.
were driven away, and how that Lisias went forth first with a great power,
and was driven away of the Jews: how that they had won the vyctory, and
gotten great goods out of the hoostes ye peryshed: how they had broken down
the abhomynacion, which he set up upon the aultare at Jerusalem, i. Ma.i. f
and fenced the Sanctuary with high walls, like as it was before yea and
Bethsura his city also.

So it chanced, that when the king had herd these words, he was afraid and
grieved very sore. Wherefore he laid him down upon his bed, and fell sick for
very sorrow: and all because it had not happened as he had devised. And there
continued he long, for his grefe was ever more and more, so yt he saw he must
needs dye. Therefore he sent for his friends: and said unto them, the sleep is
gone from mine eyes for the very sorrow and vexacion of heart that I have. For
when I consydre in my mind the great aduersyty that I am come unto, and the
floudes of heaviness which I am come i^, where as before time I was so merry and so
greatly set by (by reason of my power) Again, consydrynge the evil that I
have done at Jerusalem, from whence I took all the riches of gold and silver
that were in it, and sent to fetch away the inhabytauntes of Iewrye without
any reason why: I know, that these troubles are come upon me for the same
cause. And behold, I must dye with great sorrow in a strange land. Then called
he for one Philip a friend of his whom he made ruler of all his realm, and
gave him the crown, his robe and his ryng: that he should take his son
Antiochus unto him, and bring him up, till he might raygne him self. So the
king Antiochius Antiohus dies.i. Match.ix ^^ c. d. e
dyed there, in the.cxlix. year. When Lisias knew that the king was deed, he
ordained Antiochlus his son (whom he had brought up) to raygne in his fathers

Wherefore Judas thought to destroy the^, and called all the people together,
that they might lay siege unto them. So they came together in the.Cl. year,
and besieged them, layinge forth their ordinance and instruments of war.
Then certain of them that were besieged went forth (unto whom some ungodly
men of Israel joined them selves also) and went unto the king saying: How
long will it be, or thou punysh and avenge our brethren? We have ever been
minded to do thy father service to walk in his statutes and to obey his
commandments. Therefore our people fell from us, and wherso ever they
found any of us, they slew the^ and they have not only meddled with us, but
with all our countries: and behold, thi^ day are they besegynge the castle

and called all his fre^des, the captains of his fotemen and of all his
horsemen together. He hired men of war also out of other realms, and out of
the Isles of the sea, which came unto him. And the nombre of his host was an

and.xxxii. Elephantes well exercysed in battle. These came through Idumea
unto Bethsura, and besieged it a long season, and made diverse instruments of
war against it. But the Jews came out and brent them, and fought like men.
Then departed Judas from the castle at Jerusalem, and removed ye host toward
Bethzacaran over against the kings army.

So the king arose before the day, and brought the power of his host in to
ye wayeth Bethzacaran, where the hoostes made the^ to the battle, blowynge
the trompettes. And to provoke the Elephantes for to fight,

As for the remnaunt of the horsemen, he set them upon both the sides in two
parts with trompettes, to provoke the hooste, and to styre up such as were
stowe in the army. And when the sun shone upon their shyldes of gold and
stele, the mountains glistered again at them, and were as bright as the
tressettes of fire. The kings host also was divided, one part upon the hye
mountains, the other low beneth: so they went on taking good head, and
keeping their order. And all they that dwelt in the land, were afraid at the
noise of their host, when the multitude went forth, and when the weape^s smote
together, for the host was both great and mighty. Judas also and his host
entered in to the battle, and slew.vi.C. men of the kings army. Now when
Eleasar the son of Saura did se one of the Elephauntes dect with the kings
badge, and was a more goodlye beast then the other: he thought the king
should be upon him, and ieoparde him self to deliver his people, and to get him
a perpetual name.

Wherefore he ran with a courage unto the Elephaunt in the myddest of the host,
smytyng them down of both the sides, and slew many about him. So went he to
the Elephauntes fete, and gat him under him, and flewe him: then fell the
Elephaunte down upon him, and there he dyed. Judas also and his men saying the
power of the king, and the mighty vyolence of his host, departed from them.
And the kings army went up

But when they came out of the city (because they had no vytayles within, i.
Math.iiii. ^ vi. d ii. Math.xi. a xiii. a
and the land lay untilled) the king took Bethsura, and set men to keep it,
and turned his host to the place of the Sanctuary, and laid siege to it a great
while. Where he made all manner ordinance: handbowes, fire darts, rackettes to
cast stones, scorpyons to shout arowes, and slings. The Jews also made
ordinance against theyrs, and fought a long season.

But in the city there were no vyttayles, for it was the seventh year of the
wars, and those heathen that remained in Iewrye had eaten up all their store.
And in the Sanctuarye were few men left for the hungre came so upon them,
that they were scatered abroad every man to his own place.

So when Lisias heard that Philyppe (whom Antiochus the king while he was yet
living, ii. Math.vi. b
had ordained to bring up Antiochus his son, that he might be king) was
come again out of Persia and Medea with the kings host and thought to obtain

the trone of his kingdom, there came unto him wicked and ungodly men of
Israel: whose captain was Aleimus, that would have been made hye priest: These
men accused the people of Israel unto the king, saying: Judas and his
brethren have flayne thy fre^des, and driven us out of our own land. Wherefore
send now some man (to whom thou gyuest credence) that he may go and se all the
destruction, which he has done unto us and to the kings land, and let him be
punisshed with all his friends and favorers.

Alcimus high priest.
So they stood up, and came with a great host in to the land of Judah, sendynge
messengers to Judas and his brethren, and speaking unto them with peaceable
words: but under disceyte. Therefore Judas and his people believed not their
saying, for they saw yt they were come with a great host.

After this came the scrybes together unto Alcimus and Bachides, trusting the
best unto them. And first ye Assidans required peaxe of them, sayng: Alcimus
the pressed is come of the sede of Aaron, how can he disceyue us? So they gave
the^ loving words, and swore unto the^, and said: we will do you no harm,
neither your friends: and they believed them. But the very same day took
they.lx. men of them, and Psalm.lxxix. a
They have cast ye flesh of thy saynctes, and shed their blood round about
Jerusalem, and there was no man that would bury them. So there came a great
fear and dread among ye people, saying: there is neither truth nor
ryghtousnesse in them, for they have broken the appointment and ethe that they
made. And Bachides removed his host from Jerusalem, and pitched his tente at
Bethzecha: where he sent forth, and took many of them that had forsaken him:
He slew many of the people also, and cast them in to a great pyt. Then
committed he the land unto Alcimus, and left men of war with him to help him,
and Bachides him self went unto the king. And thus Alcimus defended his hye
presthode, and all such as vexed Israel, resorted unto him: In so much that
they obtained the land of Judah, and did much evil unto the Israelytes.

Now when Judas saw all the myschefe that Alcimus and his company had done
(yea more then the Heythen them selves) unto ye Israelytes: He went forth
round about all the borders of Iewry, and punysshed those unfaithful
re^nagates, so that they came no more but in the country. So when Alcimus saw,
that Judas and his people had gotten the vpperhande, and that he was not hable
to abide them: he went again to the king, and said all the worst of them
that he could. Then the king sent Nicanor, one of his chief princes (which
bare evil will unto Israel) and commanded him that he should utterly destroy
the people.

So Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a ii. Match. (...)
and sent unto Judas and his brethren with fre^dly words (but under disceit)
saying: there shall be no war betwyxt me and you: I will come with a few men,
to se how ye do, with fre^dshyp. Upon this he came unto Judas, and they saluted
one an other peaceablye: but the enemies were appointed to take Judas by
vyolence: Nevertheless it was told Judas, that he came unto him but under
dysceyte: wherefore he gat him away from him, and would se his face no more. When
Nicanor perceived that his council was bewrayed, he went out to fight against
Judas beside Capharsalama: where there were slain of Nicanors host.v. M. men:
the resydue fled unto the castle of David.

After this came Nicanor up unto mount Syon: and the prestes with the elders
of ye people went forth to salute him peaceablye and to show him the
burntsacryfyces that were offered for the king. But he laughed them to scorn,
mocked them, defiled their offrynges, and spoke dysdaynedly yea and swore in
his wroth, saying: If Judas and his host ii. Mack.x^^
as soon as ever I come again (and fare well) I shall burn up this house.
With that went he out in a great anger. Then the prestes came in, ii.
Para.vii. ^ iii. Reg.v^^^. ^ Esaye. (...) Math. ^x^. ^
and stood before the altar of the temple, weeping and saying: For so much
as thou, O Lord, have chosen this house, that thy name might be called upon
therein and yt it should be an house of prayer an petycyon unto thy people: Be
avenged of this man and his host, and let them be slain with the swerd:
remember the blasphemies of them, and suffer them not to continue any longer.

When Nicanor was gone from Jerusalem he pitched his tent at Bethoron, and
there an host met him out of Siria. And Judas came to Adarsa with three.M. men
and made his prayer unto God, saying: O Lord, because the messengers of king
Se^nacherib blasphemed the, the angel went forth, Esaias. ^^x^ ii. Mac.v^ (...)

and slew an Clxxxv. thousand of them: Even so destroy thou this host before

and punish him, according to his malycyousnes.

And so the hosts stroke the field, the.xiii. day of the month Adar: and
Nicanors host was discomfyted and he him self was first slain in the
battle. Nicanor.ii. Math.xv. ^
When Nicanors men of war saw that he was killed, they cast away their
weapons and fled: but the Jews followed upon the^ an hole days journey, from
Adazer unto Gazara, blowynge with the tro^pets, and making tokens after them.
So the Jews came forth of all the towns there about and blew out their horns
upon them, and turned against them: thus were all slain, and not one of them
left.

Then they took their substance for a pray and smote of Nicanors heed and his
right hand (which he held up so proudly) and brought it with them, and hanged
it up before Jerusalem Wherefore the people were excedingly reioysed, and passed
over that day in great gladness. And Judas ordained that the same day (namely
ye.xiii. day of ye month Adar) should be kept in mirth every year. Thus the
land of Judah was in rest a little while.

he proceeded further, to send Bachides and Alcimus again in to Jury, and
those that were in the right wing of his host with ehem. So they went forth by
the way that ledeth unto Galgala, and pitched their tents before Mesaloth,
which is in Arbellis, and wan the city, and slew much people. In the first
month of the.Clii. year, they brought their host to Jerusalem, and rose up
and came to Berea, with.xx. thousand fotemen, and two thousand horsemen.

Now Judas had pitched his tent at Laisa with three.M.chosen men. And when they
saw the multitude of the other army, that it was so great, they were sore
afraid, and many conveyed them selves out of the host. In so much that there
abode no moo of them but eight hundred men. When Judas saw yt his host failed
him, and yt he must needs fight, it brake his heart, that he had no time to
gather the^ together: wherefore ye man was in extreme trouble. Nevertheless he
said unto them that remained with him: Up, let us go against our enemies,
peradventure we shall be hable to fight with them. But they would have stopped
him saying: we shall be hable, therefore let us now save our lives, and turn
again to our brethren and then will we fight against them, for we are here but
few.



Now when they which were of the left wynge saw that the right side was
discomfeted, Judas is slain.
they persecuted Judas and them that were with him. Then was there a sore batel
for many were slain and wounded of both the parties: Judas also him self
was killed, and the remnau^t fled. So Ionathas and Simon took Judas their
brother, and buried him in his fathers sepulcre, in the city of Modin. And al
ye people of Israel made great lamentacion for him, and mourned long saying:
Alas that this worthy should be slain which delivered the people of Israel. As

and there arose al such as work ungodliness. In those days was there a great
derth in the land, and all the country gave over them selves and theirs unto
Bachides. So Bachides chose wicked men, and made them lords in the land. These
sought out, and made search for Judas friends, and brought them unto Bachides:
which avenged him self upon them, with great despite. And there came so great
trouble in Israel, as was not sens the time that no prophet was seen there.

Then came all Judas friends together, and said unto Ionathas: For so much as
thy brother Judas is deed, there is none like him to go forth against our
ennemies, against Bachides, and such as are adversaries unto our people.
Wherefore this day we chose the for him, to be our prince and capiteyn, to
order our battle. And Ionathas took the governance upon him at the same time,
and ruled instead of his brother Judas. When Bachides gat knowledge thereof, he
sought for to slay him: But Ionathas and Simo^ his brother perceiving that,
fled in to ye wilderness of Thecua with all their company, and pitched their
te^tes by the water pole of Asphar.

Which when Bachides understood, he came over Jordan with all his host upon the
Saboth day. Now had Ionathas sent his brother Ihon (a capiteyn of the people)
to pray his friends the Nabuthites, that they would lend the^ their

So they lift up their eyes, and looked, and behold there was much ado, and

met them with tympanies, instruments of musycke, and many weapons. Then
Ionnathas and they yt were with him, rose out of their lurkinge places against
them, and slew many of them. As for the remnaunt, they fled in to the mountayns
and they took all their substance. Thus the marriage was turned to mourning,
and the noise of their melody in to lamentacion. And so when they had avenged
the blood of their brother, they turned again unto Iordane.

Bachides hearing this, came unto the very border of Jordan with a great power

men and vitailes. He took also the chyefest men's sons in the country for
pledges, and put them in the castle at Jerusalem to be kept.

Afterward in the.Cliij. year in the second month, Alcimus commanded that the
walls of the inmost sanctuary should be destroyed, and the buildinges of the
Prophets also. And when he began to destroy them, the things that he went
about were hyndred, for he was smytten with a palsy, and his mouth shut so yt
he could no more speak, ne command any of his house concerning his
business. Thus dyed Alcimus in great miserye at the same time, and when
Bachides saw that Alcimus was deed, he turned again to the king and so the land
was in rest two years. Then

So they went and gave Bachides this counsel, which arose to come with a great
host, and sent letters privily to his adherentes which were in Iurye, to take
Ionathas and those that were with him: but they might not, for the other had
gotten knowledge of their device. And Ionathas took.l. me^ of ye country
(which were ye ryng leaders of them) and slew the^. Then Ionathas and Simon,
with their company departed unto the city Bethbessen, which lies in the
wilderness, and repaired the decay thereof, and made it strong. When Bachides
knew this, he gathered all his host, and sent word to them that were of Jury.
The^ came he and laid siege to Bethbessen, and fought

As for Simon and his company, they went out of the city, and brent up the
instruments of war, and fought against Bachides, and dyscomfeted him. And
Bachides was sore vexed because his counsel and travail was in vayn. Wherefore
he was wroth at the wicked men (that gave him counsel to come in to their land)
and slew many of them. The^ purposed he with his company to go away in to his
own country: whereof when Ionathas had knowledge, he sent ambassadors unto him
for to make peax with him, and that he should deliver him his prisoners again.
To yt which Bachides consented gladly, and did according to his desire, yea
and make an oath that he should never do him harm all the days of his life. So
he restored unto him all the prisoners that he had taken out of the land of
Judah, and then turned and went his way in to his own land, neither proceeded
he any further to com unto ye borders of Judah. Thus Israel had no more war. And
Ionathas dwelte at Machmas, and began there to govern the people, and destroyed
the ungodly men out of Israel.

Demetrius desires to have peace with Ionathas. Alexander moves war against
Demetrius. Demetrius is slain. The friendship of Ptolomeus and Alexander.

CAPI. X.
IN the.Clx. year, came Alexander, the son Alexander.
Joseph.capi.ii.iii.libr.xiii.
whose citizins received him, and there he raygned. When Demetrius herd
thereof, he gathered an excedyng great host, and went forth against him to
fight. Wherefore Demetrius sent letters unto Ionathas with loving words, and
praised him greatly. For he said: we will first make peax with him, before
he bynd him self with Alexander against us, else he shall remember the evil that
we have done against him, his brother and his people, and so he gave Ionathas
leave to gather an host, to make weapons, and to be co^federate with him, and
commanded the pledges that were in the castle to be delivered unto him.

Then came Ionathas to Jerusalem, and red the letters, in the audience of all
the people, and of them that were in the castle. And therefore were they sore
afraid, because they herd that the king had given him license to gather an
host. Thus were the pledges delivered unto Ionathas, which delivered them to
their elders. Ionathas also dwelt at and so they did. As for the Heathen yt
were in ye castles which B^chides had made up, they fled, so that every man
left the place, and went in to his own country. Only at Bethsura remained
certain of the Jews, which had for saken the law and commandments of God,
for Bethsura was their refuge.

Now when king Alexander herd of the promises that Demetrius had made unto
Ionathas, and when it was told him of the battles and noble acts, which he
and his brethren had done, and of the great trauayles yt they had taken, he
said: where shall we find such a man? well, we will make him our friend, and be
confederate with him. Upon this he wrote a letler unto him, with these words:
king Alexander saluteth his brother Ionathas. We have herd of the, that thou
art a valeau^t man, and mete to be our friend: wherefore this day we ordeyn the
to be the hye priest of thy people, and to be called the kings friend. (Upon
this, he sent him a purple clothing, and a crown of gold) that thou may
consydre what is for our profit, and keep frendshyp toward us.



All the solemn feasts, Sabothes, newemoones, the days appointed, the three
days before and after the feast, shall be fre fro all the Jews in my realm, so
that in them no man shall have power to do any thing, or to move any business
against any of them, in any manner of cause. There shall.xxx. M. also of the
Jews be written up ini the kings host, and have their wages paid, as all
other men of war of the kings should have, and of them shall be ordained
certain to keep the kings strong holds: yea and some of them shall be set over
the kings business, yt they may faithfully dele with ye same. The Jews also
shall have princes of their own, and walk in their own laws, as the king
has commanded in the land of Judah.

And the three cities that are fallen unto Jury from the country of Samaria and
Galilee, shall be taken as Jury, and be under one: neither be subject to any
strange lord, but to the hye pressed. As for Ptolomais and the land perteynynge
thereto, I give it unto the Sanctuary at Jerusalem, for the necessary expenses
of the holy things. Moreover I will give every year.xv. thousand sicles of
silver out of the kings cheker (which perteyneth unto

And besides all this, the five thousand sicles which they took yearly of the

Item, who so ever they be that fle unto the temple at Jerusalem, or within the
lyberties thereof, where as they are fallen in to the kings danger for any
manner of business, they shall be pardoned, and all ye goods that they have in
my realm, shall be fre. For the buylding also and repayring of the work of the
Sanctuary, expenses shall be given out of ye kings checker: Yea and for the
making of the walls round about Jerusalem, for the brekyng down of the old,
and for the settinge up of the strong holds in Iurye, shall the costs and
charges be given out of the kings checker.

But when Ionathas and the people herd these words, they gave no crede^ce
unto the^, i. Mac.vii. ^
neither disceyued them: for they remembered the great wickedness that he had
done unto Israel, and how sore he had vexed them. Wherefore they agreed unto
Alexander, for he was a prince that had delte friendly with them, and so they
stood by him always. Then gathered king Alexander a great host, and brought his
army against Demetrius. Iosep.capi.v l. bro.xiii.
So the two kings stroke battle together, but Demetrius boste fled, and
Alexander followed after and fell upon them. A mighty sore field was it,
contynnyng till the sun went down, and Demetrius was slain Demetri^^ slain
the same day.

And Alexander sen^e ambassadors unto over co^med Demetrius, conquered the
land, and stryken a field with him, so that we have discomfeted both him and
his host, and sit in the trone of his kingdom: Let us now make frendshyp
together, give me thy daughter to wife: so shall I be thy son in law, and
give the rewards, and her great dignytye. Ptolomy the king gave answer,
saying: Happy be the day wherein thou art come again to the land of thy
progenitors, and set in the trone of their kingdom. And now will I fulfill thy
writing: but mete me at Ptolomais, that we may se one an other, and yt I may
mary my daughter unto the according to thy desire. So Ptolomy went out of Egypt
with his daughter Cleopatra, and came unto Ptolomais in the Clxii. year, where
king Alexander met him, and he gave Alxander his daughter Cleopatra, and married
them at Ptolomais with great worwyp, like as the manner of kings is to be. Then
wrote king Alexander unto Iona thas, that he should come and mete him. So he
went honorably unto Ptolomais, and there he met the two kings, and gave them
great presents of gold and silver, and found

So it happened that when his accusers saw the worship which was proclaimed of
him and that he was clothed in purple, they fled euerychone. And ye king made
much of him, wrote him among his chief friends, made him a duke, and
partaker of his dominion. Thus Ionathas went again to Jerusalem. with peace
and gladness. (...) ^api. ^^^an.
In the.Clxv. year came Demetrius the son of Demetrius from Creta in to his

Appolonius, which had ye governance of Celosiria, to be his capteyn.

So he gathered a great host, and came unto Iamnia, and send word unto
Ionathas the hye preeste, saying: Dare thou withstand us thy self alone?
As for me, I am but laughed to scorn and shamed, because thou prouedst thy
strength against us in the

Which say that your foot is not hable to stand before our face, for thy
fathers have been twice chased in to their own land. And now, how will thou
he hable to abide so great an host of horsemen and fotemen in the feld, where as
is neither rock, stone ne place to fle unto?

When Ionathas herd the words of Appolonius, he was moved in his mind,
wherefore he chose.x. thousand men, and went out of Jerusalem, and Simon his
brother met him, for to help him: and they pitched their tents at Ioppa, but
the city kept him forth, for Ioppa was an hold of Appolonius. The^ Ionathas
laid siege to it, and they yt were in the city for very fear let him in: and
so Ionathas wan Ioppa. Appolonius hearing of this, took three thousand
horsemen, with a great host of foot, and went as though he would goo to
Azotus, and came immediately in to the plain field: because he had so many
horsemen, and put his trust in them. So Ionathas followed upon him to Azotus,
and there they stroke the battle. Now had Appolonius left a thousand
horsemen behind the^ privily in the tents. And when Ionathas knew that such
wait was laid behind them, they went round about the enemies host, and
shot darts at the people from the morning to ye euenyng. As for Ionathas
people, they kept their order as he had commanded them, and the enemies
horses were ever labourynge.

Then brought Simon forth his host, and set them against the fotemen. For the
horsemen

Thus were slain and brent well nigh eight thousand men. i. Match.xi. ^
So Ionathas removed the host from thence, and brought them to Ascalon, where
the men of the city came forth, and met him with great worship. After this
went Ionathas and his host again to Jerusalem, with great substance of
good. And when king Alexander herd these things, he thought to do Ionathas
more worship, and sent him a coler of gold, as the use is to be given unto
such as are of the kings next blood. He gave him also the city of Accaron

and went about through disceyte to obtain the kingdom of Alexander, and to
join it unto his own realm. Upon this he took his journey in to Siria, and
was letten in to the cities, and men came forth to mete him: for king
Alexander had commanded them so to do, because he was his father in law. Now
when Ptolomy entered in to any city, he left men of war to keep it, and this
he did through out all the cities. And when he came to Azotus, they showed him
the temple of Dagon and Azotus that was brent up, with the other things which
were destroyed, the deed bodies cast abroad* and the graves that they had made
by the way side, for such as were slain in the field: And told the king
that Ionathas had done all these things, to the intent they might get him
evil will. But the king: said not a word thereto. And Ionathas met the king
with great honor at Ioppa, where they saluted one an other, and took their
rest. So when Ionathas had gone with the king, unto the water that is called
Eleutherus, he turned again to Jerusalem. Now Ptolomy had gotten the dominion
of the cities unto Seleucia upon the sea cost,

Thus he took his daughter from him, gave her unto Demetrius, and forsook
Alexander so that his malice was openly known. And Ptolomy came to Antioch,
where he set two crowns upon his own heed: the crown of Egypt and of Asia. In
the mean season was king Alexander in Cilicia, for they yt dwelt in those
places, had rebelled against him. But when Alexander herd of this, he came to
war against him. So king Ptolomy brought forth his host, and met him with a
mighty power, and chased him away. Then fled Alexander into Araby, there to be
defended, and king Ptolomys honor increased. And Zabdiel the Arabian smote of
Alexanders heed, and sent it unto Ptolomy. Alexaunder is slain.
But the third day after dyed king Ptolomy him self, and they whom he had ^et
in the strong holds, were slain of those that were within the cities. And
D^metrius reigned in ye hundred.lxvij. year.

At the same time gathered Ionathas them that were in Iewry to lay siege unto
the castle which was at Jerusalem, and so they made many instruments of
war against it. Thou went there cert^^n ungodly persons (which hated their
(...) people) unto king

And though certain ungodly men of his own people made complayntes upon him,
yet the king entreated him, like as his predecessors had done before, and
promoted him in the sight of al his friends, confirmed him in the hye presthod,
with all ye worship yt he had before, and made him his chief friend. Ionathas also
desired the king that he would make Jury fre, with the three head cities in
Samaria and the lands perteynge thereto: upon this did Ionathas promise him
three.C. talentes. Whereunto the king consented and gave Ionathas writing of the
same, co^teyning these words: King Demetrius sends greting unto his brother
Ionathas, and to the people of the Jews. We send you here a copy of the
lettre which we did write unto our elder Lasthenus, concerning you, that ye
should know it.

King Demetrius sends gretynge unto Lasthenus his elder. For the

After this, when Demetrius the king saw i. Math.xii. ^
Now was there one Triphon, that had been of Alexanders part before, which when
he saw that all the host murmured against Demetrius, he went to Emalcuel the
Arabia^ (that brought up Antiochus the son of Alexander) and lay sore upon
him to deliver him this young Antiochus: that he might raygne in his fathers
stead. He told him also what great evil Demetrius had done, and his men of
war loved him not: and so remained there a long season.

And Ionathas sent unto king Demetrius, to drive them out which were in the
castle at Jerusalem and in the other refugyes, for they did Israel great harm.
So Demetrius sent word unto Ionathas, saying: I will not only do these things
for the and thy people, but at time conuenyent I will do both the and thy
people great worship. But now thou

Then ye king called for the Jews help, which came unto him al together, and
went abroad through the city, and slew the same day an. C.M. men: set fire
upon the city, gat many spoils in that day, and delivered the king. So when
the cytezyns saw that the Jews had gotten their will of the city, and they
them selves dispoynted of their purpose they made their supplication unto the
king, saying: Grant us peace, and let the Jews cease from troublynge us
and the city, and upon this they cast away their weapens. Thus they made
peace, and the Jews gat great worship in the sight of the king, and in the
sight of all that were i^ his realm, and were spoken of through out ye kingdom:
and so they came again to Jerusalem with great goods.

So the king Demetrius sat in the trone

Upon this he sent him golden vessels to be served in, and gave him leave to
drink in gold to be clothed in purple, and to were a coler of gold. He made
his brother Simon also captain, from the coostes of Tyrus unto the borders of
Egypt. Then Ionathas took his iourneye, and went through the cytyes beyond
the water of Iordane, and all the men of war of Syrya gathered the^ unto him
for to help him. So he came unto Ascalon, and they of the city received him
honorably: and from thence went he unto Gaza, but they would not let him in:
wherefore he laid siege unto it burning up and spoylyng ye places that were
about the cyty.

And the cytezyns of Gaza submytted the^ selves unto the Ionathas, which made
peax

And behold, the hosts of the heithen met them in the field, and laid watch
for them in the mountains: so that when Ionathas came against them ye other
(which were laid to watch) rose out of their places, and fought, and they that
were of Ionathas side, fled every man: and there was not one of them left,
except Mathathias the son of Absalomus, and Judas the son of Calphi the
captain of the host. Then Ionathas rent his clothes, laid earth upon his
head, made his prayer, and turned again to them in ye field: where they
fought together, and he put them to flight. Now when his own men that were
fled, saw this: they turned again unto him, and helped him to follow upon all
their enemies unto their re^tes at Cades. So there were slain of ye heythen
the same day.iij.M. me^, and Ionathas turned again to Jerusalem,

IOnathas saying that the time was mete for him, chose certain men and sent

counsel, and said: Ionathas the high priest and the people of the Jews sent
us unto you, for to renew the old frendshyp and bond of love. Upon this the
Romans gave them fre pasportes, that men should led them home into the la^d
of Judah peaceably. And this is ye copy of ye letters that Ionathas wrote unto
the Sparcians.

Ionathas the high pressed with the elders, prestes, and the other people of the
Jews, send gretyng unto the Sparcyans their brethren. There were letters sent
long ago unto Onias the hye priest, from Arius, which the^ raygned among you:

And though we have had great troubles and wars, so that the kings about
us have foughten against us: yet would we not be grievous unto you, nor to other

so that we are deleuered, and our enemies subdued. Wherefore we chose Numenius
the son of Antiochus and Antipater the son of Jason, and sent them unto the
Romans, for to renew the old bode of frendshyp and love with them. We
commanded them also to come unto you, to salute you, and to deliver you our
letters, concerning the renouocacyon of our brotherhode. And now ye shall do
right well, to give us an answer thereunto.

And this is the copye of the writing,

When Ionathas herd, that Demetrius princes were come forth to fight against
him, with a greater host then before, he went from Jerusalem, and met them in
the land of Hemath, for he gave the^ not space to come in to his own
country. And he sent spies unto their tents, which came again and told
him, that they were appointed to come upon him in the night season. Wherefore
when the sun was gone down, Ionathas commanded his men to watch all the
night and

Then Ionathas foloweh upon them, but he might not overtake them, for they were
gone over the water Eleutherus. So Ionathas departed unto the Arabia^s (which
were called Zabadei) slew them, and took their goods. He proceeded further
also, and came unto Damascus, and went through all that country. But Simon his
brother took his journey and came to Ascalon and to the next strong holds:
departing unto Ioppa, and wan it. For he herd that they would stand of
Demetrius party: wherefore he sent men of war in the city, to keep it. After
this came Ionathas home again, and called the elders of the people together:
and devised with them for to build up the strong holds in Iewry, and the
walls of Jerusalem, to set up an hye wall betwyxt ye castle and the city, for
to separate it from the city, that it might be alone, and that men should
neither bye nor sell in it.

Upon this they came together for to build up the cyty: and for as much as the
wall upon the broke of the west side (called Caphetherah) was fallen down, they
repaired it. And Simon let up Adiadah in Sephelah, and made it strong setting
ports and locks upon it. Now when Tryphon purposed to raygne in i. Math ^^.c
Iosep.ca.xix lib xiii.
and to slaye the king Antiochus: he was afraid ye Ionathas would not suffer
him, but right against him. Wherefore he went about to take Ionathas and to kill
him.

So be departed, and came unto Bethsan. Then went Ionathas forth against him to
the battle with forty thousand chosen men and came unto Bethsan also. But
when Triphon saw that Ionathas came with so great an host to destroy him, he
was afraid: and therefore he received him honorably commended him unto all his
friends, and gave him rewards, and commanded his men of war to be as
obedyent unto him, as to him self.

And said unto Ionathas: why have thou caused this people to take such
travail, seeing there is no war betwyxte us? Therefore send them home again
and, chose certain men to wayt upon the, and come thou with me to Ptolomais:
for I will give it with the other strong holds, men of war and their
officers.

As for me, I must depart, this is only the

Now as soon as Ionathas entered in to Ptolomais, the cytysyns sparred the
gates of the city, and took him, and slew all them with the sword, yt came in
with him. Then sent Triphon an host of fotemen and horsemen in to Galilee, and
in to the great plain field, (...) is (...)
to destroy all Ionathas company. But when they knew that Ionathas was taken,
and al they slain that waited upon him: they took counsel together, and came
forth ready to ye battle. So when they which followed upon them, saw that it
was a matter of life, they turned back again. As for the other, they went in
to the land of Judah peaceably, and bewailed Ionathas, and the^ that were with
him right sore. And Israel made great lamentaco^. Then all the Heathen that
were round about them, thought to destroy them. For they said: now have they
no captain, nor any man to help them. Therefore let us overcome them, and
rote out their name from among men.

After Ionathas was taken, Simon is chosen captain, of whom Triphon taking
his children and money for the redemption of Ionathas, kylleth him and his
children. The grave of Ionathas. Triphon kills Antiochus, and possesses the
realm. Demetrius takes truce with Simon. Simon wynneth Gaza. He possesses
the tower of Syon. He makes his son John^ Captain.

and what manner of troubles we have seen: through occasyon whereof, al my
brethren are slain for Isreal's sake, and I am left alone. And now let not me
spare mine own life in any manner of trouble, for I am no better then my
brethren: but will avenge my people and the Sanctuary, our children and our
wives: for all the Heathen are gathered together to destroy us of very malice.

At these words, the hertes of the people were kynled together, so that they
cried with a loud voice, saying: Thou shalt be our captain instead of
Judas and Ionathas thy brethren, order thou our battle, and whatsoever thou
commaundest us, we shall do it. So he gathered all the men of war making haste
to finyssh all the walls of Jerusalem, which he made strong round about.



But when Triphon knew that Simon stood up instead of his brother Ionathas,
and that he would war against him: he sent messengers unto him, saying:
Where as we have kept Ionathas thy brother, it is for money that he is a wyng
in the kings account concerning the busynes that he had in hand. Wherefore
send now an.C. talentes of silver and his two sons for suertye, that when he
is letten forth he shall not forsake us: and we shall send him again.
Nevertheless Simon knew, that he dyssembled in his words yet commanded he the
money and children to be delivered unto him: lest he should be the greater
enemy against the people of Israel, and say: because he sent him not the
money and the children, therefore is Ionathas deed.

So Simon sent him the children and an hundredth talentes, but he dyssembled,
and Ionathas and his sons are slain.
he slew Ionathas and his sons there and then turned for ^o goo home in to
his own land.

Then sent Simon for to fet his brothers deed corse, and buried it in Modin his
fathers city. So all Israel bewailed him with great lamentacyon, and mourned
for him very long. And Simon made upon the sepulcre of his father and his
brethren a building high to look unto of fre stone behind and before: and set
up seven pyllers one against an other, for his father, his mother and four
brethren, and set great pyllers round about, with arms upon them for a
perpetual memory, and carved ships beside the arms: that they might be seen
of me^ sailing in the sea. This sepulcre which he made at Modin stands yet
unto this day.

Now as Triphon went forth to walk with ye young king Antiochus, Triphon.
Iosep.capi.x.libro.xiii.
he slew him trayterouslye, and raygned in his stead, crowned him self king of
Asia, and did much evil in the land. Simon also buylt up the castles in
Iewry, making them strong with high towers, great walls, ports and locks,
and laid up vyttayles in the strong holds. And Simon chose certain men and
sent them to king Demetrius: to desire him, that he would discharge the land
from all bondage, for Triphon had spoiled it very sore. Where upon Demetrius
the king answered him, and wrote unto him after this manner.

Demetrius the king sends gretynge unto Simon the high priest his friend
with the elders and people of the Jews. The golden crown and precious stone
that ye sent unto us, have we received: and are ready to make a steadfast peace
with you, yea and to write unto our officers, for to release you, concerning
the things wherein we made you fre: and the appoyntmente that we make with you,
shall be fyrme and stable. The strong holds which ye have builded, shall be
your own. As for any over syghte or fault committed unto this day, we
forgive it, and the crown tax that ye ought us also. And where as was any
other trybute in Jerusalem, it shall now be no trybute: and look who are mete
among you to be in our court, let the^ be written up, that there may be
peace betwyxte us.

Thus the yoke of the Heathen was taken i. Mat, xiiii. d

In those days went Simon unto Gaza, and besieged it round about, where he set
up ordinance of war. And wan a tower which he took. So they that gat in to
the tower leapte in the city, which was in a great fear: In so much that
the people of the city rent their clothes, and clymed up upon the walls with
their wives and children, besechynge Simon to be at one with them: saying.



Now when they in the castle of Jerusalem were kept so straytlye, that they
could not come forth ne in to the country, and might neither bye ne sell:
they were very hungrye, and many of them famysshed to death: In so much that
they besought Symo^ to be at one with them, which he granted them. So he put
them out from thence, and cle^sed the castle from fylthynesse. And upon
the.xxiii. day of the second month in the hundredth.lxxi. year, they entered
into it with thanks gyuynge and branches of palm trees, with harpes,
crowdes, cimbales, and lutes singing Psalms, and songs or praise unto God,
for that the great enemy of Israel was overcome.

And Simon ordained that the same day should be kept every year in
gladness, and made strong the hyl of the temple that was beside the castle,
where he dwelte him self with his company. Simon also perceyuinge that John
his son was a mighty man of arms, made him captain of all the hosts, and
caused him to dwell at Gaza.

Demetrius is over come of Arsaces. Simon being captain there is a great

were they glad to have him for their ruler and to do him worship always.

Simon wan the city of Ioppa also for an haven town, and made it an intraunce
in to the Isles of the sea. He enlarged the borders of his people, and conquered
them more land: He gathered up many of their people that were prisoners he had
the domynion of Gaza, Bethsura and the castle, which he cle^sed from

the^ away. He set up the Sanctuarye and increased the holy vessels of the
temple.

When the Romans and Sparcyans had gotten word that Ionathas was deed, they
were right sorry. But when they herd that Simon his brother was made high
priest in his stead, and how he had won the land again with the cytyes in
it: they wrote unto him in tables of latyne, to renew the friendship and bond
of love, which they had made before with Judas and Ionathas his brethren. Which
wrytynges were red before the congregacyon at Jerusalem.

And this is the copye of the lettres, i. Math. (...) d. and xii. ^
that the Sparcyans sent: The Senators and cytysyns of Sparta send gretinge
unto Simo^ and prosperous wealth: we were glad of their coming, and have
written the errande which they spoke before the counsel of the people:
namelye, that Numenius the son of Antiochus, and Antipater ye son of Jason,
the Jews ambassadors are come unto us, for to renew the old friendship with
us. Upon this the people consented, that the men should be honorably entreated,
and that ye copy of their errande should be written in the specyal books of
the people, for a perpetual memory unto the Sparcians: yea and that we should
send a copy of the same unto Simon ye great priest.



The.xviii. day of the month Elul in the Clxxii. year, in the third year of
Simon the hye priest, in the great congreacyo^ of the prestes, rulers of the
people, and elders of ye country at Asarame, were these words openly declared.



After that would their enemies have trodden their holy things under foot,
destroyed their land, and utterly wasted their Sanctuarye. Then Simon
withstode them, and fought for his people, spent much of his own money,
weapened the valeaunte men of his people, gave them wages, made strong the
cities of Judah, with Bethsurah, that lies upon the borders of Iewrye (where
the ordinance of their enemies lay sometime) and set Jews there for to keep
it.

So all the people consented to allow Simon, and to do according to these
words. Simon also him self took it upon him, and was content to be the hye
pressed, the captain and prince of the Jews and prestes, and to govern them
all. And they commanded to make this writing in tables of latin, and fasten
it unto the compass of the Sanctuary in an open place: and to lay up a copy
of the same in the treasury, that Simon and his posterytye might have it.

Antiochus makes a couenaunte of frendshyppe with Simon, and Triphon is
persecuted. The Romans write letres unto kings and nations in the defense of
the Jews. Antiochus refusing the help that Simon sent him, breaks his
couenaunte.

In the.Clxxiiii. year went Antiochus in to his fathers land, and all the men
of war came together unto him, so that few were left with Triphon. So the
king Antiochus followed upon him, but he fled unto Dora, which lies by the sea
side: for he saw that there was myschefe coming unto him, and that his host
had forsaken him. Then came Antiochus unto Dora with an hundredth and twentye
thousand men of arms upon foot, and eight thousand horsemen. So he compased
the city round about, and the ships came by the sea. Thus they vexed the
city by land and by water, in so much that they suffered no man to go in nor
out.

So Athenobius the kings friend came to Jerusalem, and when he saw the great
worship and honor of Simon in gold, silver, and so great plenty of
ornaments: he marueyled, and told Simon as the king commanded him. Then
answered Simon and said unto him: As for us, Iudi.xi.^. ^
we have neither taken other men's land, ne withholden them, but only our
fathers heritage, which our enemies had vnrightously in possessyon a certain
time.

This heritage, of our father have we challenged in process of time. And where
as you complaynest concerning Ioppa and Gaza, they did great harm to our
people and in our land yet will we give an hundredth talentes for them.

Israel, and recompensed evil for good. The^ wrote this Ptolomy the same unto
king Antiochus, requiryng him yt he should send him an host to help him, and so
should he deliver him the land, with the cities and tributes of the same. He
sent other men also unto Gaza, for to take Ihon: and wrote unto the capitaynes
to come to him, and he should give them silver, gold, and rewards. And to
Jerusalem he sent other to take it and the Sanctuary.

departed out of the holy land and kingdom, they brent up the ports, and
shed innocent blood. Then made we our prayer unto the Lord, and were herd:

prestes which the^ sought the honor of God, took the fire pryuely from the
altar, and hyd it in a valey, where as was a deep dry pyt, and therein they
kept it, because the place was unknown to every man. Now after many years
when it pleased God that Nehemiah should be sent from the king of Persia, he
sent the chylders children of those prestes (which had hyd the fire) to seek
it. And as they told us they found no fire, Leui.vi. a x. a.xvi. ^

hallowed them: receyuyng the offering for the hole people of Israel, preserve
thine own porcio^, and halow it. Gather those together that are scatred abroad

Now when the sacrifice was brent, Nehemiah commanded the great stones to be
sprinkled with the residue of the water. Which when it was done, there was
kyndled a flame of them also: but it was consumed through the light that
shyned from the altar. So when this matter was known, it was told the king
of Persia, that in the place where the priests which were led away, had hyd
fire, there appeared water instead of fire, and t^^t Nehemias and his company
had purified the sacrifices withal. Then the king consyderyng and ponderynge
the matter dilygently, made him a temple to prove the thing yt was done. And
when he found it so in deed, he gave the prestes many gifts, and diverse
rewards, yea he took the^ with his own hand and gave them. And Nehemias called
ye same place Nephthar, which is as much is say, as a clensyng: but many men

that such as are disposed to read, might have pleasure and pastyme therein: and

why? He that begins to write a story for the first, must with his

Nevertheless when he might not overcome Onias, he gat him to Appolonius the
son of Thersa (which then was chief lord in Celosyria and Phenices) and told
him that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of innumerable money, and how that
the commons goods, which belo^ged not unto the offrynges, were exceeding great
also: yea, and how it were possible that all these might come under the kings

Moreover there appeared two fair and beautyful young men in goodly array, which
stood by him, scourged him of both the sides, and gave him many stripes without
ceasing. With that fell Heliodorus suddenly unto ye ground. So they took him up,
being compassed about with great darkness, and bare him out upon a bear. ii.

The^ certain of Heliodorus fre^des prayed Onias, that in all haste he would

So Heliodorus offered unto God, made great vows unto him which had granted
him his life, thanked Onias, took his host, and went again to the king. Then
testified he unto every man of the great works of God that he had seen with
his eyes. And when the king asked Heliodorus who were mete to be sent yet ones

necessary matters. But he (when he was praised of the king for magnifying of

talentes of silver for Jason. So when he had gotten commandments from the
king, he came having nothing that becomes a pressed, but bearing the stomach
of a cruel tyrant, and the wrath of a wild brute be. Then Jason, which
had disceyued his own brother, saying that he him self was begyled also, was
feign to flee in to the land of the Ammonites, and Menelaus gat the dominion.
But as for the money that he had promised unto the king, he did nothing therein,
when Sostratus ye ruler of the castle required it of him. For Sostratus was
the man that gathered the customs: wherefore they were both called before the
king: Thus was Menelaus put out of the presthod, and Lysimachus his brother
came in his stead. Sostratus also was made lord of the Cyprians.



Which when Onias knew of a surety, he reproved him, but he kept him in a
Sanctuary beside Daphnis that lies by Antioche. Wherefore Menelaus gat him to
Andronicus, and prayed him yt he would slay Onias. So when he came to Onias, he
counseyled him craftily to come out of the Sanctuary, gyuyng him his hand with
an oath (how be it he suspecte him) and then he slew Onias, without any
regard of rightousnesse. Onias is slain.
For the which cause not only the Jews, but other nations also took
indignacio^, and were displeased for the vnryghtous death of so godly a man.



So when the people arose and were full of displeasure, Lysimachus armed
three.M.unthrifts to defend him, a certain tyrant being their captain,

purpose of Lysimachus, some gat stones, some good strong clubbes, and some
cast ashes upon Lysimachus. Thus there were many of the wounded, some being
slain, and all the other chased away. But as for the wicked church robber him

As for Jason he spared not his own citezyns ii. Match.iiii ^

Finally, for a reward of their wickedness he was accused before Aretha the
king of ye Arabians: In so much that he was feign to fle from city to city,
being despised of every man as a forsaker of the laws, and an abomynable
person. And at the last (as an open enemy of his own natural country and
of the citezyns) he was driven in to Egypt.

Thus he that before put many out of their own natyue land, perisshed from home

reason of kynred. And he that before had casten many one out unburied, was
thrown out him self, no man mourning for him, ne putting him in his grave:
so that he neither enjoyed the burial of a stranger, neither was he partaker
of his fathers sepulcre.



Thus was there a great slaughter of young men, old men, women, children and
virgyns. In three days were there slain.lxxx.M. fortye thousand put in preson,
and no less sold. Yet was he not content with this, but durst go in to the
most holy temple (Menelaus that traitor to the laws and to his own natural

other kings and cities had given thither for the garnyshyng and honor of the

are ready rather to suffer death, then to offend the laws of God and the
fathers. Then was the king angry, and bad heat cauldrons and brazen pottes.
Which whe^n they were made hot, immedyatly he commanded the tongue of him that
spoke first to be cut out, to pull the skyn over his head to pare of the
edges of his hands and sete: yea and that in the sight of his mother and the
other of his brethren. Now when he was clean marred, he coman^ded a fire to be

if he would eat swynes flesh, or he were payned in the other members also through

he tormented like as the first and when he was even at the gyuynge up the ghost
he said: Thou most ungracious person put us now to death, but the king of

God, for he shall raise us up again. As for yt, thou shall have no
resurrection to life.

And when they had spoken to the fyfth, they tormented him. Then looked he unto
the king, and said: thou have power among men, for thou art a mortal man also
thy self, to do what thou will, but thynk not, that God has forsaken our
generacyon. Abide the, tarry still a while, and thou shall se the great power of
God, how he will punish the and thy sede. After him they brought the syxth,
which being at the point of death, said: Be not disceyued (O king) for this we
suffer for our own sakes, because we have offended our God, and therefore
marvelous things are showed upon us. But think not thou, which take in
hand to strive against God, that

This exellent mother (worthy to be well reported of, and had in remembrance)
saw her seven sons dye in one day, and suffered it pacyently, because of the
hope that she had in God: yea she exhorted every one of them in especyal, and
that boldly and steadfastly with parfyte wisdom, waking up her wyuysshe
thought with a manlye stomach, and said unto them: I can not tell how ye came
in my womb, for I neither gave you breath ne soul, no nor life. It is not I
that joined the members of your bodies together, but the maker of the world,
which fashyoned the birth of man, and began all things. Even he also of his
own mercy shall give you breath and life again, like as ye now regard not
your own selves for his sake.

Now thought Antiochus that she had despised him, therefore he let her go with
her reproues, and began to exhort the youngest son (which yet was left) not
only with words, but swore unto him with an oothe, that he should make him a
rich and welthtye man if he would forsake the laws of his fathers: yea and
that he should give him: what soever were necessary for him. But when the young

I beseech the (my son) look upon heaven and earth and all that is therein,
and co^sydre, that God made them and man's generacyon of naught: so shall thou
not fear this hangman, but suffer death stedfastlye, like as thy brethren have
done: that I may receive the again in the same mercy with thy brethren.

While she was yet speaking these words the young man said: Whom look ye for?
Wherefore do ye tarry? I will not obey the kings commandment, but the law
that God gave us by Moses. (...) ii. a

And though God be angry with us a little while (for our chastenynge and
reformacyon) yet shall he be at one again with his servants. But thou. O
shameful and most abhomynable person. Pride not thy self through vain hope, in
being so malycyous upon the servants of God: for thou have not yet escaped
the judgment of the God which is almyghtye and sees all things. My
brethren that have suffered a little pain are now under the covenant of
everlasting life: but through the judgment of God, thou shalt be punysshed
ryghtouslye for thy pride.

As for me, like as my brethren have done, I offer my soul and my body for the
laws of our fathers, calling upon God, that he will soon be merciful unto
our people yea and with pain and punysshment to make the grant, that he only
is God. ii. Macha.ii. e
In me now and in my brethren the wrath of almyghtye God is at an end, which
ryghtouslye is fallen upon all our people.

Then the king being kyndled in anger was more cruel upon him then upon all
the other, and took indignacion, that he was so lightly regarded. So this young
man dyed undefiled, and put his trust still in the Lord. Last of al after the
sons, was the mother put to death also. Let this now be enough spoken
concerning the offrynges, and extreme cruelnes.

Judas gathers together his host. Nycanor is sent against Judas. Judas

So they called upon the Lord, that he would have an eye unto his people:
which was trodden down of every man: to be gracyous unto the temple, that was
defiled of the ungodly to have compassyon upon the destruction of the city
which was shortly like to be laid waste: to hear the voice of the blood
that cried unto him: to remember the most vnryghtous deaths of young innocent
children the blasphemies also done unto his name, and to punysh them.

Now when Machabeus had gathered this multitude together, i. Macha.ii. ^
he was to mighty for the heathen, for the wrath of the Lord was turned into
mercy, he fell upon ye towns and cities at unawares, burnt them took the
most commodious places, and slew many of the enemies. But specially he made
such chases by night in so much that his manliness was spoken of every where.

So when Philip saw that the man increased

When Judas knew of this, he told the

But the other that remained, came together and besought the Lord, to deliver
them from that wicked Nicanor, which had sold them or ever he come nigh them:
and thought he would not do it for their sakes, yet for the covenant that he
made with their fathers, and because they called upon his holy and glorious
name. And so Machabeus called his men together, namely about six thousand,
exhorting them not to agree unto their enemies, neither to be afraid for the
multitude of their adversaries coming against them vnryghtouslye: Deute.xx. a
ii. Para.xx.c
but to fight manlye, considering the reprofe that they had done unto the
holy place without cause, how they had despised and oppressed the city, yea
and destroyed the laws of the fathers. For they said he, trust in their
weapons and boldness, but our confydence is in the almyghtye Lord, which in
the twynklyng of an eye may both destroy them that come against us,
Ierem.xvii. b Psalm.xx. b
and all the world.

He exhorted them also to call to remembrance, the help that God showed unto
their fathers: as when there perished an hundredth iiii. Reg.xix. g Esaias xxxvii.
f i. Match.vii.c
And of ye battle that they had in Babylon against the Galacyans: how that all the Macedonyans that came to help them, stood in fear: and how they being but
only six.M. flewe an hundredth and twenty thousand, through the help that was
given them from heaven, whereby they also had received many benefytes.

Through these words, the men took good hertes unto them, ready to dye for the
law and the country. So he set upon every company a captain, one of his
own brethren: Simon, Joseph and Ionathas: gyuyng each fyftene hundredth men. He
caused Esdras also to read the holy book unto them, and to give them a token
of the help of God.

Then he him self being captain in ye fore front of the battle, buckled with

the help of the Lord brought down even of them whom he regarded not: in so
much that he put of his glorious raiment fled by see and came alone to
Antioch, with great shame and dyshonoure, which he gat through the destruction
of his host. Thus he that promised the Romans to pay them their trybute,
when he took Jerusalem: began now to say plainly, that God was the defender of
the Jews, and therefore not posyble to wound them because they followed the
laws which God had made.

CAPI. IX.
AT the same time came Antiochus again i. Mat.vi
For when he came to Persepolis, and undertook to rob the temple and to subdue
the city, the people ran together and defended them selves, in so much that he
and his were feign to fle with shame. And so after ye flight, it happened, that
Antiochus came again with dishonor. But when he came to Egbathana, he gat
knowledge what was happened unto Nycanor and Tymotheus. Now as he was auauncyng
him self in his wrath, he thought he was hable to avenge the injury that was
done to them upon the Jews: and therefore commanded to make ready his charret,
hastyng on his journey without ceasynge, the judgment of God provoking him,
by cause he had spoken so proudly, that he would come to Jerusalem, and make it
a grave of the Jews. But ye Lord God of Israel, that seith al things, (...) b
smote him with an inuysyble plage, which no man could heal.

For as soon as he had spoken these words, there came upon him an horrible
pain of his bowels, and a sore grefe of the tharmes. And that was but right:
for he had martyred other men's bowels with diverse and strange torments, (...)
how be it, he would in no wise cease from his malice. Yea he was yet the
prouder and more malicyous against the Jews: But while he was commaundynge to
make haste in the matter, it happened that he fell down vyolentlye from the
charret, so that it broosed his body, and did him great pain.

And so he that thought he might command the floudes of the sea (so proud
was he beyond the condicyon of man) and to wey the high mountains in a pair
of scales, was now brought down to the ground, and carried upon an horslytter,
knowledgynge the manifest power of God upon him: so that the wicked body of his
was full of worms, which in his pain fell quyck out of his flesh: In so much
that his host was grieved with the smell and stynke of him. Thus he that a
little before thought he might reach to the startes of heaven, him might no man
now abide ne bear, for the vehemence of styncke.

Therefore he being brought from his great

And as touching the Jews whom he had judged not worthy to be buried, but
would have cast them out to be devoured of the fowls and wild beasts,
saying: that he would have destroyed both old and young: Now he promyseth, to
make them like the cytezins of Athens. And where as he had spoiled the holy
temple before, now he makes promise to garnysh it with great gifts, to
increase the holy ornaments, and of his own rentes to bear the costs, and
charges belongyng to the offrynges: yea and that he would also become a Jew him
self, to go through every place of the world and to preach the power of God.

But when his pains would not cease, (for the ryghtous judgment of God was
come upon him) out of a very despair he wrote unto the Jews a letre of
intercession containing these words: The king and prince Antiochus wyssheth
unto ye verteous cytesyns of the Jews, much health and good prosperytye.

If ye and your children fare well, and if all things go after your mind: we
give great thanks. In my sickness also do I remember you louyngly: for as I
came out of Persia, and was taken with sore disease: I thought it necessary to
care for the comen wealth. Neither despair I in my self, but have a good hope
to escape this syckenes.

Thus that murderer and blasphemer of God was sore smytten: Daniel.viii. ^
and like as he had entreated other men, so he dyed a miserable death in a
strange country upon a mountain. And his body did Phylyp (that went with
him) carye away: which fearinge the son of Antiochus, went in to Egypt to
Ptolomy Philometor.

might come no more in to such trouble: but if they sinned any more against him,
he him self to chasten them with mercy, and not to come in the hands of those
aleauntes and blasphemous men.

Now upon the same day that the strangers polluted the temple, it happened
that on the very same day it was cleansed again: namely, the two and twenty
day of the month called Casleu. They kept right days in gladness, i.

like as in the feast of the tabernacles:

How Antiochus then (that was called the noble) dyed, it is suffycietly told.
Now will we speak of Nicanor the son of that wicked Antiochus, how it happened
with him: and so with few words to comprehend the aduersytie that chaunsed
in the wars. When he had taken in the kingdom, he made one Lysias (which had
been captain of the host in Phenices and Siria) ruler over the matters of ye
realm. For Ptolomy that was called Macron, being a ruler for the Jews, and
specially, to sit in judgment for such wrong as was done unto them, undertook
to deal peaceably with them. For the which cause he was accused of the friends
before Eupator: and when he was suspecte to be a traitor (because he had left

that he would be their helper: and so they fell in to ye strong hold of the
Idumeans, and wanne many places by strength: Such as came against them they
slew, and killed no less (of all together) then twenty thousand.
Nevertheless some, no less then nine thousand, were fled in to two strong

being gyrded with heery cloth about their loins, fell down before the

it is promised in the law. So after the prayer they went on further from ye
city: and when they came nigh the enemies they prepared them selves against
them.

there appeared before them upon horsbacke a man in white clothing,

commonwealth: and what so ever Machabeus wrote unto Lysias concerning the
Jews, the king granted it. For there were letters written unto the Jews
from Lysias containing these words.

Now when they were gone from thence.ix. furlonges in their journey toward
Timotheus five.M. men of foot, and five.C. horsemen of the Arabians fought with
him. So when the battle was ernest, and prospered with Judas through the help
of God: the residue of the Arabians being overcome, besoughte Judas to be at
one with them, and promised to give him certain pastures, and to do him good in
other things. Judas thinkyng that they should in deed be profitable concerning
many things, promised them pear: whereupon they shoke hands, and so they
departed to their tents. Judas went also unto a city, which was very fast
kept with bridges fensed round about with walls and diverse kinds of people
dwelling therein, called Caspin.

They that were within, put such trust in Iosue.vi. ^
did cast down the walls of Jericho in the time of Iosue) fell manfully upon
the walls, took the city, and (through the help of the Lord) made an exceeding
great slaughter: in so much that a lake of two furlonges broad, which lay
thereby, seemed to flow with the blood of the slain.

Then departed they from thence.vii. C. and fifty furlonges, and came to Taraca
unto ye Jews that are called Tubianei. But as for Timotheus, they could not
get him there: for (not one matter dispatched) he was deperted from thence, and
had left certain men in a very strong hold. But Dositheus and Sosipater,
which were capiteyns with Machabeus, slew those that Timotheus had left in the
house of defense, even.x. M. me^. And Machabeus prepared him with the six.M.
men that were about him, set them in order by co^panyes, and went forth
against Timotheus, which had with him an hundred and.xx. M. men of foot, two
thousand and five.C. horsemen.

When Timotheus had knowledge of Judas Judith. ^ i. Reg (...) ii. Part* ^
were rather discomfeted of their own people, and wounded with the strokes of
their own swerdes. Judas also was very ernest in following upon them,
punysshyng those ungodly, and slew.xxx.M. men of them. Timotheus also him
self fell in to the hands of Dositheus and Sosipater whom he besought with
many prayers, to let him go with his life: because he had many of the Jews
fathers and brethren in prison which, if they put him to death, might ^e
disappoynted. So when he had promised faith fully to deliver them again
according to ye condition made, they let him go without harm for the health of
the brethren. And when Judas had slain.xxv. thousand, he went from Carnion.

Now after yt he had chased away and slain his enemies, he removed the host
toward young men kept the walls, defendyng them mightily. In this city was
much ordinance and provision of darts. But when Judas and his company had
called upon almighty God, which with his power breaks the strength of the
enemies, they wan the city and slew xxv.M. of them yt were within. From
thence went they to the city of the Scithia^s, which lies six hundred
furlonges from Jerusalem. But when the Jews which were in the city testified,
that the cityzyns dealte louynglye with them: yea and entreated the^ kyndly in
the time of their adversity, Judas and his company gave them thanks,
desiring them to be friendly still unto them: and so they came to Jerusalem the
hye feast of the wekes being at hand. And after the feast they went forth
against Gorgias the governor of Idumea, with three thousand men of foot, and
four.C horsemen. Which when they met together, it chaunsed a few of the Jews
to be slain.

And so every man gave thanks unto the Lord for his ryghtous judgment,
which had opened the thing that was hyd. They fell down also unto their
prayers, and besought God, that the fault which was made might be put out of
remembrance. Besides that, Judas exhorted the people earnestly to keep them
selves from such syn: for so much as they saw before their eyes, that these
men were slain for the same offense. So he gathered of every one a certain,
in so much that he brought together two.M. drachmas of silver, which he sent
unto Jerusalem, yt there might a sacrifice be offered for the mysdede. In the
which place he did well and right, for he had some consideracion and pondryng of
the life that is after this time. For if he had not thought that they which
were slain did yet live, it had been superfluous and vain, to make any vow or
sacrifyce for them that were deed. But for so much as he saw that they which
dye in the favor and bylefe of God, are in good rest and joy, he thought it
to be good and honorable for a reconcylynge, to do the same for those which
were slain, that the offense might be forgyuen.

three hundred charettes. ii. Match.iiii. d
Menelaus also joined him self with them, (but with great disceyte) and spoke
fair to the king, not for any good of the country but because he thought
to have been made some great man of authority. But the king of kings moved
Antiochus mind against this ungodly person, and Lysias infourmed the king,
that this Menelaus was the cause of all myschyefe: so that the king commanded
to take him, and (as the manner of them is) to put him unto death in the same
place. Menelaus is put to death.


There was also in the same place a tower of fyftye cubytes high, heaped with
ashes: but above it was so made, that men might look down on every side.
Where in to the king commanded that shameful person to be cast among the
ashes, as one that was cause of all vngracyousnesse. And reason it i. Macha.x.
^
for he had done much myschief unto ye altar of God (whose fire and ashes
were holy) therefore was it right, that he him self also should he destroyed
with ashes.

But the king was wod in his mind, and came to show him self more cruel unto
the Jews then his father was: which when Judas perceived, he commanded the
people to call upon the Lord night and day, that he would now help them also,
like as he had done always: For they were afraid to be put from their law, from
their natural country, and from the holy temple: and not to suffer the
peeople (which a little while before began to rcouer) to be subdued again of the
blasphemous nations.

So when they had done this together, and be sought the Lord for mercy with
weeping and ready. But he and the elders together devised to go forth first with
their people, before the king brought his host in to Iurye, and before he
besieged the city, and so to commit the matter unto God.

Wherefore he ascribed ye power of al things unto God the maker of the world,
exhortyng his people to fight manfully (yea even unto death) for the laws, the
temple, the city, their own natyue country, and to defend the citezins, and
set his host before Modin. He gave them also yt were with him a toke^ of the

Thus when they had brought a great fear and rumor among the tents of
their enemies, and all things went prosperouslye with them, they departed in
the break of the day, ii. Mat.xi. a
God being their helper and defender. Now when the king perceived the
manlynesse of the Jews, he went about to take the strong places by craft,
and removed his host unto Bethsura, which was a well kept house of defense of
the Jews: but they were chased away, hurt and discomfeted.

And Judas sent unto them that were in it, such things as were necessary.
In the Jews host also there was one Rhodocus, which told the enemies their
secrets: but they sought him out, and when they had gotten him, they put him
in prison. After this did the king comme^ with them that were in Bethsura, took
truce with them, departed, and stroke a battle with Judas, which overcame
him.



Now when he was reconciled with them, he offered, made much of the temple, gave
great gifts unto it, enbraced Machabeus making him capiteyn and governor from
Ptolomais unto the Gerrenes.

Nevertheless, when he came to Ptolomays, the people of the city were not
content with that bond of frendshyp: for they were afraid that he would break
the covenant. Then went Lysias up in to the seat and enfourmed the people,
showed them the cause why, and pacifyed them. So he came again to Antioche.
This is now the matter concerning the kings iourneye, and his return.

of the king. Nicanor commands Razia to be taken. The boldness of Razia.

CAPI. XIIII.
AFter three years was Judas informed how that Demetrius the son of Seleucus

For I, being depryued of my fathers honor

When he had spoken these words, other friends also having evil will at
Judas, set the king Demetryus on fire against him. Which immediately sent
Nicanor (ruler of the elephauntes) a captain, in to Iurye: commaundynge him
to take Judas him self alive, but to slay them that were with him, and to
make Alcimus hye preeste of the temple.

Then the Heathen which fled out of Iurye from Judas, came to Nicynor by
flocks, ii. Math^. (...)
they sprinkled them selves with earth, and besought him which made them his
people, and ever defended his own portion with evident tokens that he would
preserve them still. So at the commandment of the capiteyn, they removed
from thence, and came to a town called Dedassan. And Simon Judas brother fell
in hand with Nicanor, but through the sudden coming of the enemies, he was
afraid.

Nevertheless Nicanor hearing the manlynesse of them that were with Judas,
and yt bold stomachs that they had to fight for their natural country,
durst not prove the matter with bloudsheddynge. Wherefore he sent Possidonius,
Theodocius and Mathias before, to give and take peace. So when they had taken
long aduysement thereupon, and the captain showed it unto the multitude:
they were agreed in one mind to have peax. And they appointed a day to sit
upon these matters quyetly among them selves, the stoles also were brought and
set forth. Nevertheless Judas commanded certain men of arms to wait in
conuenyente places, leest there should suddenly arise any evil through the
enemies. And so they co^moned reasonably together..



Which letters when Nicanor had seen, he (...) vii.c
I shall remove this temple of God in to ye plain feld, I shall breakedowne the
aultare, and consecrate this temple unto Bachus. After these words he departed.

Then the prestes lift up their hands toward i. Macha.iiii. ^ ii. Macha.x. a
Therefore now O most holy Lord, keep this house ever undefiled whilately was
cleansed. Now was there accused unto Nicanor, one Rasis an Alderman of
Jerusalem, a lover of the hole city, Rasis.
and a man of good report: which for the kind heart that he bare unto the
people, was called a father of the Jews. This man often times when the Jews
were minded to keep them selves undefiled, defended and delivered them being
content steadfastly to spend his body and his life for his people.

So Nicanor willing to declare the hate

Nicanor goes about to come upon Judas on the Saboth day. The blasphemye of
Nicanor. Machabeus expoundynge unto the Jews the vysion, boldeneth their
hertes. The prayer of Machabeus. After the host of Nicanor is ones overcome.
Machabeus commands his head and his hands to be cut of, and his tongue to
be given unto fowls.

CAPI. XV.
Now when Nycanor knew that Judas was in the country of Samaria, i.
Match.vii. d
Nevertheless the Jews that were compelled to goo with him, said: O do not
so cruellye and vnkyndelye, but halowe the Sabbath day, and worship him that
sees all things. For all this, iii. Regu^.xx. ^
yet said the ungracious, person: Is there a mighty one in heaven, that
commanded the Sabbath day to be kept. And when they said: yea, the living
God, the mighty Lord in heaven commanded the seventh day to be kept. He
said: Exo.xx.d
And I am mighty upon earth to command them for to arm them selves and to
perform the kings business. Notwitstandyng he might not have his purpose.



So when their hertes were plucte up, he showed them also the deceytfulnesse of
the Heathen, and how they would kept no covenant nor oath. Thus he weaponed
the^ not with the armoure of shylde and spear, but with wholesome words and
exhortacio^s. He showed them a dream also, Judas dream.
wherthorowe he made them all glad, which was this: he thought that he saw
Onias (which had been hye pressed a virtuous and loving man, sad and of honest
conuersacyon, well spoken, and one that had been exercised in godliness from a
child) holdyng up his hands toward heaven, and praying for his help. After
this there appeared unto him an other man, which was aged, honorable and
glorious. And Onias said:

And so they were well comforted through the words of Judas, and took courage
unto them, so that the young men were determined in their minds to fight, and
bide sly fly at it: In so much that in the things which they took in hand,
their boldness showed ye same, because the holy city and the temple were in
peril: for the which they took more care the^ for their wives, children,
brethren, and kynsfolkes. Again, they that were in the city, were most
careful for those which were to fight. Now when they were al in a hope yt the
judgment of the matter was at hand, and the enemies drew nigh, the host
being set in a raye, the Elephauntes and horsemen every one sta^dyng in his
place: Machabeus co^sydered the coming of the multitude, the ordinance of
diverse weapons, the cruelnesses ii. Para.xlii^* Iudicu^.v^^
Therefore in his prayer he said these words.

O Lord, iiii. Reg.xix. Esaias.xxxvii* i. Match.vii ^ ii. Mac.viii. ^
thou that dyddest send thine Angel in the time of Ezechiah king of Judah, and
the host of Senacherib slewest an C.lxxxv.M. send now also thy good angel
before us, O Lord of heuens, in the fearfulnes and dread of thy mighty arm,
that they which come against thy holy people to blaspheme them may be afraid.
And so he made an end of his words. Then Nicanor and they that were with him,
drew nigh with shawmes and songs: but Judas and his company with prayer and
calling upon God. With their hands they smote, but with their hertes they
prayed unto the Lord and slew no less the^.xxxv.M. men: For through the present
help of God they were gloryouslye comforted.

Now when they left of, and were turning again with joy, they understood that
Nicanor him self was slain with the other.

Then they gave a great shoute and a cry praysynge the almighty Lord with a
loud voice. Nicanor is slain.
And Judas (which was ever ready to spend his body and life for his cytezyns)
commanded to smite of Nicanors head, with his arm and hand, and to be
brought to Jerusalem. When he came there, he called all the people, and the
prestes at the altar with those that were in the castle, and showed them
Nicanors heed, and his wicked hand, which he had presumptuouslye holden up
against the temple of God. He caused the tongue also of that ungodly Nicanor to
be cut in little pieces, and to be cast to the fowls, and the cruel man's hand
to be hanged up before the temple.

So every man gave thanks unto ye Lord saying: blessed be he, that has kept
his place undefiled. And Nicanors head, he hanged upon the high castle for a
plain token of the help of God. And so they agreed together to keep that day
holy, namely the.xiii. day of the month Adar, which in the Sirians language
is called the next day before Mardocheus day, thus was Nicanor slain, and
from that time forth yt Jews had the city in possession. And here I will now
make an end.

wise men from the Eest to Jerusalem, saying: where is he that is borne king
of Jews? We have seen his sterre in the Eest, and are come to worship him.

When Herod the king had herd this, he was troubled and all Jerusalem with
him / and he gathered all the chief priests and scrybes of the people / and
asked of them where Christ should b^ borne. And they said unto him: at Bethleem
in Iewry. For thus it is written By the Prophet Mich.v. a. John.vij. f.
And thou Bethleem in the land of Iewry art not the leest among the princes
of Judah. For out of the shall come unto me the captain that shall ph govern
my people Israel.

Then Herod preuely called the wise men To govern is to order and rule the
people by learning and example. Act.xx. f.
Go and search narowly for the child. And when ye have found him, bring me
word, that I may come and worship him also.

When they had herd the king / they departed: and lo, the sterre which they
saw in the Eest went before them, till it came and stood over the place where
the child was. When they saw the sterre, they were merueylously glad: and
went in to the house, and found the child with Marye his mother / and kneled
down and worshypped him, and opened their treasures / and offered unto him
gifts / gold franckensence and myrre. Psalm.lxxi. b. Esaie.lx. a
and after they were warned of God in a dream that they should not go again
to Herod, they returned in to their own country an other way.

When they were departed: behold the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph
in a dream saying: arise and take the child and departed in to Egypt, and
was there till the death of Herod, Osee.xi. a
to fulfill that was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, which says / out of
Egypt have I called my son.

Then Herod perceyuyng that he was mocked of the wise men was very wroth and
sent forth and slew all the children that were in Bethleem / and in all the
costs thereof / as many as were two year old and under, according to the time
which he had diligently serched out of the wise men.

Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by the prophet Ieremye saying:

When he saw many of the pharysees and the Sadduces come unto his baptysme /
he said unto them: O progenye of ph bypers, who has taught you to flee from
the vengeance to come? Do therefore fruits worthy repentance. And think not
to say in your selves, we have Abraham to our fathers. For I tell you, God is
hable of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. Now is the axe put to

is hewn down and cast in to the fire.

I baptyse you in water in token of repentance: but he that comes after me

voice from heaven saying: This is that my beloved son in whom is my delight.

Christ fasteth and is tempted: he calls Peter, Andrew, James, and John^, and

CAPI. IIII.
THen was Jesus led away of the spirit Jesus faste^
to be tempted of the devil. And when he had fasted fourtye days and fourtye
nyghtes / he was at last an hungered. Then came to him the tempter, and said: If
thou be the son of God speak that these stones be made breed. He answered and
said: it is written, Deute.viii ^ Sapi.xvi. ^
man shall not live by breed only, but by every word that comes out of the
mouth of God.

Then the devil took him up in to the holy city, and set him on the pinnacle of
the temple, and said unto him: if thou be ye son of god, cast thy self down.
For it is written; Psalm.lxxx^. ^
he shall give his aungelles charge over the, and with their hands they shall
hold the up, that thou dasshe not thy foot against a stone. And Jesus says
Deute.vi. ^
Thou shalt not tempte thy Lord God.

Again the devil took him up, and led him in to a very high mountain, and
showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and all the glory of them / and said
to him: all these will I give the / if thou wylt fall down and worship me.
Then says Jesus unto him. Avoid Satan. For it is written, Deu.vi.i. ^^
thou shall shorshyp the Lord thy god, and him only shall thou serve.

Then the devil left him / and behold, the angels came and served him.

When Jesus had herd that John^ was taken, he departed in to Galile and
leaving Nazareth, went and dwelte in Capernaum, a city by the seee side, in
the costs of Zabulon and Nephtalim / to fulfill that was spoken by Esaias.ix. ^
The land of Zabulon and Nephtalim, the way of the sea beyond Jordan, Galile
of the Gentyles, the people which sat in darcknes, saw great light and to them
which sat in the country and shadow of death, light is begone to shine.

From that time Jesus began to preach / and say: Repent, for the kingdom of
heaven is at hand.

As Jesus walked by the sea of Galile he saw two brethren: Simon, called
Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net in to the sea, for they were
fysshers, and said unto them, follow me, and I will make you fysshers or men.
And they forthwith left their nets, and followed him.



And Jesus went about all Galile, teaching in their assembles, and preachinge
the Gospel of the kingdom, and healed all syknesse, and al dyseases among
the people. And his fame spread abroad through out all Siria. And they brought
unto him all sick people that were taken with diverse dyseases and grypynges,
and them that were taken with deuyls, and lunaryke persons, and those that had
the palsye: and he healed them. And there followed him a great nombre of people,
from Galile, and Oecapolie and from Jerusalem, and from Iewry, and from

AT that time Jesus went on the Saboth Mark. (...) Luke.vi. ^
and his disciples were an hongred, and began to pluck the ears of corn /
and to eat. when the pharysees saw that, they said unto him: Behold, thy
discyples do that which is not lawful to do upon the Saboth day. He said
unto them. Have ye not red what David did when he was an ho^gred, i. Reg.xx. ^
and they also which were with him? How he entered in to the house of God, and
ate the shewbreed which were not lawful for him to eat, neither for them
which were with him, but only for the priests. Nu.xxv^^^

sacrifyce: ye would not have condemned the gyltles. For the son of man is
Lord even of the Saboth day.

And he departed thence, and went in to their synagoge: and behold there was a
man which had his hand dried up. And they asked him saying: Is it lawful to
heal on the Saboth days? because they might accuse him. And he said unto
them: which of you, if he shall have a sheep fallen in to a pytte on the Saboth
day would not take him and lift him out? And how much is man better then a
sheep? wherefore

Then the pharysees went out, and held a counsel against him, how they might
destroy him. When Jesus knew that, he departed thence / and much people
followed him / and he healed them all / and charged them they should not make
him known: to fulfill that was spoken by Esaias the prophet, which says:
Esaie.xiii. ^
Behold my child, whom I have chosen my beloved, in whom my soul delyteth.
I will put my spirit on him / and he shall show judgment to the gentiles. He
shall not strive / he shall not cry / neither shall any man hear is voice in
the streets / a brosed read shall he not not break / and the smokynge flax he
shall quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory, and in his name
shall the Gentyles trust.

Then was brought to him one possessed with a devil, Luke, xi.c.
which was both blind and domme, and he healed him / in somoch that he which
was blind and domme, both spoke and saw. And all the people were amassed, and
said: Mar iii.c. Luke.xii.c.
Is not this that son of David? But when the pharysees herd that / they
said: This fellow dryueth not forth the deuyls but by the help of Beelzebub
chief of the deuyls.

But Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them. Every kingdom divided
against it self, is brought to naught. Neither shall any cast out deuyls: by
whose help do your children cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.
But if I cast out the deuyls by the spryte of God: then is the kingdom of God
come on you.

Either how can a man enter in to a strong man's house, and bereue him of his

that is not with me, is against me. And he that gathers not with me,
scatters abroad. Wherefore I say unto you, all manner of sin and raylynge
shall be forgyuen unto men: but the raylynge against the spyryte, shall not be
forgyuen unto men. And who so ever speaks a word against the son of man,
it shall be forgyuen him. But who so ever speaks against the holy ghost, it
shall not be forgyuen him, neither in this world, neither in the world to
come. Either make the tree good, and his fruit good also: or else make the tree
evil, and his fruit evil also. For the tree is known by his fruit. O
generacyon of vypers, how can ye say well, when ye your selves are evil? For
of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks. A good man, out often he good
treasure of his heart, brings forth good things. And an evil man out of his
evil treasure, brings forth evil things. But I say unto you, that of
every ydell word that men shall have spoken: they shall yield accomptes at the
day of judgment. For by thy words thou shall be justified: and by thy words
thou shall be condemned.

Then answered certain of the Scrybes and of the Pharisees, saying: (...)
Master, we would feign se a sygn^ of the. He answered and said to them: The
evil and aduoutrous generacyon seeks a sign, but there shall no sign be
given them, save the sign of the Prophet Jonas. For as Jonas was three days

THe same day went Jesus out of the Marck.iiii. a Luke.viii. a
and much people resorted unto him, so greatly that he went, and sat in a
ship, and all the people stood on the shore. And he spoke many things to them
in parables, saying: Behold the sower went forth to sow. And as he sowed, some
fell by the ways side, and the fowls came and devoured them up. Some fell upon
stony ground where they had not much earth and anon they spronge up, because
they had no depth of earth: and when ye sun was up, they caught heat, and for
lack of rotynge, wythered away. Some fell among thorns and the thorns
spronge up and choked the^. Part fell in good ground, and brought forth good
fruit: some an hundredth fold, some sixtye fold some thyrtye fold. Whosoever
has ears to hear let him hear.

And the disciples came and said to him: Esa.vi. ^
with the ears ye shall hear and shall not understand, and with the eyes ye
shall se, and shall not perceive. For this peoples hertes are wexed gross, and
their ears are dull of hearing. and their eyes have they closed, lest they
should se with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand
with their hertes, and should turn that I might heal them.

But blessed are your eyes, for they se: and the stony ground, is he which
hears the word of God, and anon with joy receives it, yet has he no rote
in him self, and therefore dure^h but a season: for as soon as trybulacyon or
persecucyon aryseth because of the word, forth with he is offended. He that
was sown among thorns, is he that hears the word of God: but the care of
this world, and the disseytfulnesse of riches choke the word, and so is he
made unfruitful. He which is sown in the good ground, is he that hears
the word and understands it: which also bears fruit and brings forth,
some an hundred fold, some syxtye fold, and some thyrtye fold.



Marck.iiii. d
An other parable he put forth unto them saying: The kingdom of heaven is like
unto a mustarde seed that a man takes and sows in his field, which is the
leest of all seeds. But when it is grown, it is ye greatest among herbs, and
it is a tree: so that the birds of the air come and buyld in the branches of
it.



Marck.iiii.c
All these things spoke Jesus unto the people by similitudes, and without
similitudes spoke he nothing to them, to fulfill that was spoken by the
Prophet, saying: Psalm.lxxvii. a
I will open my mouth in parables, and will speak forth things which have
been kept secret, from the beginning of the world.

Then sent Jesus the people away, and came home. And his disciples came unto
him, saying: declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. Then
answered he, and said unto them: Tares are expounded.
He that sows the good seed is the son of man. And the field is the worth.
And the children of the kingdom, they are the good seed And the tares are the
children of the wicked. And the enemy that sows them, is the devil. The
harvest is the end of the world. And the repers be the Angels. For even as
the tares are gathered and brent in the sire: so shall it be in the end of

Jesus said unto them. Understand ye all these things? They said: yea Lord.
Then said he unto them. Therefore every Scribe which is taught unto the
kingdom of heaven is like an householder, which brings forth of his treasur,
things both new and old.

And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these symylytudes, he departed
thence and came into his own country, and taught them in their sinagoges: in
so much that they were astonyed and said: whence comes all this wisdom and
power unto him? Is not this the Carpenters son? Is not his mother called
Marye? and his brethren be called James and Ioses and Simon and Judas? And are
not his systers al here with us? Whence has he all these things. And they were
offended by him. Then Jesus said to them, a Prophet is not without honor,
save in his own country, and among his own kyn. And he did not many
miracles there, because of their unbelief.

he walked on the water to go to Jesus. But when he saw a mighty wind, he was
afraid. And as he began to syncke, he cried saying: Master save me. And
forthwith Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him, and said to him: O
little faithful, wherefore did thou doubt? And as soon as they were come in
to the ship, the wind ceased. So they in the ship, came and worshypped him,
saying: Certainly thou art the son of God. And when they were come over,

And he called the people unto him and said to them: hear and understand.
That which goes in to the mouth defyleth not the man, but that which comes
out of the mouth defyleth the man.

Then came his discyples and said unto him: Perceyuest thou not how the
Pharysees are offended in hearing this saying? He answered and said: all
plantynge which my heavenly father has not planted, shall be plucked up by the
roots. Let them alone, they be the blind leaders of the blind. If the blind
lead the blind, both shall fall into the dyche.

Then answered Peter and said to him, declare unto us this parable. Then said
Jesus: are ye yet without understanding? perceive ye not, that what so ever

And Jesus went thence, and departed in to the coostes of Tire and Sydon. And
behold, a woman of Cane came out of the same coostes, and cried unto him,
saying: Have mercy on me Lord, thou son of David, my daughter is soore
vexed with a devil. And he gave her never a word to answer. Then came to him
his discyples and besought him saying: Send her away for she follows us

house of Israel. Then she came and worshypped him, saying: master help me. He

unto her. O woman great is thy faith, be it to the as thou desyrest. And her
dou^hter was made hole at that same hour.



Then Jesus called his discyples to him, and said: I have compassion on the
people because they have continued with me now.iij. days, and have naught to
eat, and I will not let them go fasting, lest they perysshe in the way. And
his disciples sai unto him: whence should we get so much breed in the
wyldernes to fill so great a multitude? And Jesus said unto them: how many
loves have ye? They said seven, and a few little fysshes. And he commanded
the people to sit down on the ground, and taking the seven loves, and the
fysshes, gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the
discyples gave them to the people. And they did all eat, and were filled. And
they took up of the fragme^tes that were left seven baskets full. And yet they
that ate were four. M. men, beside women and children. And he sent away the
people, and took ship and came in to the parties of Magdala.

Then he charged his discyples, that they should tell no man that he was Jesus

must go unto Jerusalem,

Jesus then said to his disciples. If any man will follow me, let him deny him
self, and take up his cross, and follow me. For who so ever will save his life
shall lose it. And who so ever shall lose his life for my sake, shall find it.
What shall it profit a man, though he should win all the hole world, if he
lose his own soul? Or else what shall a man give to redeem his soul again
withal? For the son of man shall come in the glory of his father, with his
angels: and then shall he reward every man according to his deeds. Verily I

money, came to Peter and said: Does your master pay tribute? He said yea. And
when he was come in to the house, Jesus prevented him, saying: what thynkest

their children, or of strangers? Peter said unto him: of strangers. Then

they twain shall be one flesh. Wherefore now are they not twain, but one
flesh. Let not man therefore put asonder that God has coupled. Then said
they to him: why did Moses command to give a testimonial of diuorsement, and
to put her away? Deuteronomy.xxii^* ^ Iere.iii. a Mala.ii.c
He said to them: Moses because of ye hardness of your hertes, suffered you to
put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. I say therefore
unto you, who so ever puts away his wife, except it be for aduoutry and
maryeth an other, commytteth aduoutry. And who so ever maryeth her which is
divorced does commyt aduoutrye.

Then said his disciples to him: if the matter be so bitwene man and wife, it is
not good to marye. He said unto them, all men can not away with that saying,
save they to whom it is given. For there are some gelded, which were so borne
out of their mothers belly. And there are gelded, which be made of men. And
there be gelded, which have gelded them selves for the kingdom of heaven. He
that can take, let him take. Then were brought to him young children, that he
should put his hands on them and pray. And the discyples rebuked them. But
Jesus said: suffer the children, and forbid them not to come to me, for of
such is the kingdom of heaven. And when he had put his hands on them, he
departed thence,

And behold one came and said unto him: Good master, what good thing shall I

herd that saying, he went away mourning. For he had great possessions.

Then Jesus said unto his disciples: Verily I say unto you, it is hard for a
rich man to enter in to the kingdom of heaven. And moreover I say unto you:
it is easyer for a camel to go through the eye of a nedle, then for a rich
man to enter in to the kingdom of God. When his discyples herd that, they were
excedyngly amassed, saying: who then can be saved? Jesus beheld them, and
said unto them: with me^ it is impossible, but with God all things are
possible.

soulde and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money
chau^gers, and the seats of them that sold doves, and said to them: It is

In the morning as he returned in to the city he hungered, and spyed a fygge
trees in the way, and came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves, and
said to it: never fruit grow on the hence forwards. And anon the fygge tree
wyddered away. And when his discyples saw that, they meruayled saying. How
sone is the fygge tree wyddered away?

And when he was come in to the temple, the chief priests and the elders of
the people, came unto him as he was teaching, and said: by what auctorite
do thou these things? and who gave the this power? Jesus answered and said
unto them: I also will ask of you a certain questyon, Mar.xi. d Luke.xx. a
which if ye assoyle me, I in likewise will tell you by what auctorite I do
these things. The baptysme of John^: whence was it? from heaven, or of men?
Then they reasoned among them selves saying: if we shall say from heaven, he
will say unto us: why did ye not then bileue him? But if we shall say of men,
then fear we the people. For all held John^ as a prophet. And they answered
Jesus and said: we can not tell. And he likewise said unto them: neither tell I
you by what authority I do these things. What say ye to this? A certain man
had two sons, and came to the elder and said: son go and work to day in
my vyneyarde. He answered and said, I will not: but afterward repented and
went. Then came he to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and
said: I will sir, yet went not. Whether of them twain did the will of the

husbandmen? They said unto him: he will cruelly destroy those evil persons,
and will let out his vyneyarde unto other husbandmen, which shall deliver him
the fruit at times convenient. Jesus said unto them: did ye never read in the
scriptures: The stone which the buylders refused, the same is set in the
pryncypall part of the corner: this was the Lords doing / and it is
merueylous in our eyes. Therefore say I unto you, the kingdom of God shall be

entreated them foully, and slew them. When the king heard that, he was wroth,

Then said he to his servants: the wedding is prepared. But they which were

The same day the Sadduces came to him (which say that there is no
resurrection) and asked him saying: (...) ^^v. a.

wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. There were with us seven brethren and
the first married and deceased without issue and left his wife unto his brother.
Likewise the second and the third even until the seventh. Last of all the
woman dyed also. Now in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven?
For all had her. Jesus answered and said unto them Mat.xii. b
ye are deceived and understand not the scriptures, nor yet the power of God.
For in the resurrection they neither mary nor be given in marriage: but are as
angels in heaven

As touching the resurrection of the deed: have ye not red what is said unto
you of god which says: Exodi.iii. b
I am Abraham's God, and Isaacs God, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of

astonyed at his doctrine.

When the Pharisees had herd, how he had stopped the Sadduces mouths, they
drew together, and one of them a doctor of law, asked him a question,
temptinge him, and saying: Master which is the chief commandment in the law?

While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them saying: What
think ye of Christ? Whose son is he? They said unto him, The son of
David. He said unto them: How then does David in sprite, call him Lord,
saying: The Lord said to my Lord, sit on my right hand, till I make thyn

none could answer him again one word: neither durst any from that day

whosoever swears by the offering that lies on the altar, is bound. Ye

Beware no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying: I am

beginning of sorrows.

Then shall they put you to trouble, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of

After a long season, the Lord of those servants came and rekened with them.
Then came he that received five talentes, and brought other five talentes,
saying: Master, thou delyueredst unto me five talentes: behold, I have gained
with them five talentes moo. His master said unto him: Oh good servant and

Ye know that after two days shall be Easter, and the son of man shall be

scribes, and the elders of the people to the palace of the high priest, called
Cayphas, and took counsel, how they might take Jesus by gyle, and kill him.
But they said, not on the feastfull day, least any aroure arise in the people.

When Mar.xiiii. ^ Luke vii. ^
Jesus was in Bethanye, in the house of Simon the leper, there came unto him a
woman, which had an alabaster box of precious oyntement, and powered it on his
hedde, as he sat at the bourde. When his disciples saw that, they disdayned,
saying: What neded this waste? This oyntement might have been sold for much
money, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood that, he said unto them:
Why trouble ye the woman? She has wrought a good work upon me. For ye have
pore folk always with you but me have ye not always. For where as this
woman has casten this oyntement on my body, she did it to burye me with.
Verily I say unto you, Where so ever this Gospel shall be preached throughout
the hole world, there shall also this that she has done be told for a
remembrance of her.

sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him: is it I master? He
answered and said: he that has dypped his hand with me in the dysshe,
Psalmo.xl.
The son of man goes as it is written of him: but woe be to that man, by
whom the son of man is betrayed. It had been good for that man, if he
had never been borne. Then Judas which betrayed him, answered and said: is

took bred and when he had given thanks, brake it, and gave it to the
disciples, and said: (...) b. (...) c.
Take eat, this is my body. And he took the cup, and thanked, and gave it
them, saying: drink of it every one. For this is my blood of the new
covenant shed for many, to the forgyuenesse of sins. I say unto you: I
shall not drynk hence forth of this fruit of the vine till that day, when I
shall drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom.

And when they had given praises, they went out into mount Olyuete. Then
said Jesus unto them: all ye shall be offended by me this night. For it written:
(...)
I will smite the shepeherde, and the sheep of the flock shall he scattered
abroad. But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galile. Peter
answered, and said unto him: though all men should be offended by the, yet
would I never be offended. Jesus said unto him: Verily I say unto the, that

He went forth ones again, and prayed, saying: My rather, if this cup can
not pass away from me, but that I drink of it, thy will be done. And he
came, and found them a sleep again. For their eyes were heavy. And he left
them and went again, and prayed ye third time, saying the same words. Then

done that the scriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled. Mar.xiiii. f

Then all the disciples forsook him and fled. And they took Jesus and led him
to Cayphas the chief Priest,

The chief priests and elders, and all the^ concile, sought false witness
against Jesus, to put him to death, but found none: in so much that when many
false witnesses came, yet found they none. At last came two false witnesses,
and said: This man said: I can destroy the temple of God, and build it again
in three days. And the chief Priest arose, and said to him: answerest thou
nothing? How is it that these bear witness against the. But Jesus held his
tongue. And the chief priest answered, and said to him: I conjure the in the
name of the living God, that thou tell us, whether thou be Christ the son of
God. Jesus said to him: thou have said. Nevertheless I say unto you

plates, in the temple, and departed, and went and hounge him self.

And the chief prestes took the silver plates and said: It is not lawful to

Pilate unto him: Hear thou not, how many things they lay against the?
And he answered him to never a word: in so much that the deputy merueled
greatly.

At that feast, the deputy was wont to deliver unto the people a prisoner,
whom they would desyer. He had then a notable prysonner called Barrabas. And
when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them: Mar.xv. a John.xviii.
g
Whether will ye that I give loosse unto you Barrabas or Jesus which is called
Christ? For he knew well, that for envy they had delivered him.

When he was set down to give judgment his wife sent to him, saying: Have thou
nothing to do with that just man. For I have suffered many things this day
in a dream, about him. But the chief prestes and elders had persuaded the
people, that they should ask Barrabas, and should destroy Jesus. Then the
deputy answered and said unto them: whether of the twain will ye that I let
loosse unto you? And they said, Barrabas. Pilate said unto them: what shall I
do then with Jesus, which is called Christ? They all said to him: let him be
crucified. Then said the deputy: What evil has he done? And they cried the
more, saying: Let him be crucyfyed. When Pilate saw that he prevailed
nothing, but that more business was made, he took water, and washed his
hands before the people, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this His
(...) confesse^ him to b^
just person, anyse you. Then answered all the people, and said: his blood
be on us, and on our children. Then let he Barrabas loosse unto them and
scourged Jesus, and delivered him to be crucyfyed.

Then the soudiours of the deputy took Jesus unto the comune hall, and
gathered unto him all the company. And they strypped him and put on him a
purpyl robe, and platted a crown of thorns and put upon his head and a reed
in his right hand: and bowed their knees before him, and mocked him, saying:

When they had crucyfyed him, they parted his garments, and did cast lottes:
to fulfill that was spoken by the Prophet. Psalm.xxi. ^ Mar.xv* ^

his death written. This is Jesus the king of the Jews. Mar.xv. ^* Luke.xx^^
And there were two thieves crucyfyed with him,

They that passed by, reuyled him, waggynge their heddes, and saying: Thou
that destroyest the temple of God, and buyldest it in three days, save thy
self. If thou be the son of God, come down from the cross. Likewise also
the high Prestes mocking him, with the Scrybes and elders, said: He saved
other, him self he can not save. If he be the king of Israel: let him now
come down from the cross, and we will believe him. He trusted in God, let him
deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the son of God.
That same also the thieves, which were crucified with him, cast in his teeth.

From the syxte hour was there derckenes over all the land unto the nynth

them ran and took a sponge, and filled it full of vyneger, and put it on a

cried saying: Ah, what have we a do with the, Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come
to destroy us? I know what thou art, that holy of God. And Jesus rebuked him
saying: be still and come out of the man. And the unclean spirit tare him,

when they had found him, they said unto him: all men seek for the. And he

could not come nyghe unto him for prease, they uncovered the rofe of the

shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast in those days.

The parable of the sower. Christ stilleth the tempest of the sea / which
obeyed him.

CAPI. IIII.


And some fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, so
that it gave no fruit. And some fell upon good ground and did yield fruit that
spronge and grew, and brought forth: some thirty fold, some syxtye fold,
and some an hundred fold. And he said unto them: he that has ears to hear,
let him hear.

And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve, asked him of
the parable. And he said unto them. To you is it given to know the mysterye
of the kingdom of God. But unto them that are without,

The sower sows the word. And they that are by the ways side, where the
word is sown, are they to whom as soon as they have herd it, Satan comes
immediately, and takes away the word that was sown in their hertes. And
likewise they that are sown on the stonye ground, are they: which when they
have herd the word, forthwith receive it with gladness, yet have no rotes in
them selves, and so endure but a time: and anon as trouble and persecucion
arises for the words sake, they fall immediately. And they that are sown
among the thorns, are such as hear the word, and the care of this world
and the disceytfulnes of riches, and the lusts of other things enter in and
chooke the word, and it is made vnfrutful. And those that were sowed in good
ground, are they that hear the word and receive it, and bring forth fruit,
some thyrty fold, some syxtye fold, some an hundred fold.

And he said unto them: is the candell lyghted Math.xiii. b.
unto him that has, shall it be given / and from him that has not, shall be
taken away, even that he has.

And he said: so is the kingdom of God, as if a man should sow seed in the
ground, and should sleep, and rise up night and day: and the sede should
spring and grow up, he not ware. For the earth brings forth fruit of her
self: first the blade, then the ears, after that full corn in the ears. And
as soon as the fruit is brought forth, anon he puts to the sykell, because
the heruest is come.

And he said: Where unto shall we lyken the kingdom of God? or with what
parable shall we compare it? It is like a grain of mustardseed, which when it
is sown in the earth, is the leest of all seeds that be in ye earth: but after
that it is sown, it grows up, and is greateste of all herbs: and bears
great branches, so that the fowls of the air may dwell under the shadow of
it.

And with many such similitudes he preached the word unto them, after as they
might hear it. And without similitude spoke he nothing unto them. But when
they were a part he expounded all things to his disciples. And the same day
when even was come, he said unto them: Let us pass over unto the other side.
And they left the people, and took him even as he was in the ship. And there
were also with him other ships.

And behold, there came one of the rulars of the Synagoge, whose name was
Iairus: and when he saw him, he fell down at his fete, and besought him
greatly saying: my daughter lies at point of death, I would thou would

For she thought: if I may but touch his clothes I shall be hole. And forthwith
her fountain of blood was dried up, and she felt in her body, that she was
healed of the plage.

And Jesus immediately felt in him self, the virtue that went out of him, and
turned him round about in the preace, and said: who touched my clothes? And
his disciples said unto him: seyst thou the people thrust the, and yet ask,
who did touch me? And he looked round about, to se her that had done that
thing. The woman feared and trembled (for she knew what was done in her,) and
she came and fell down before him, and told him the hole truth. And he
said to her: Daughter, thy faith has made the hole: go in peace, and be hole
of thy plage.

unto them: a Prophet is not despised, but in his own country, and among his
own kynne, and among them that are of the same household. And he could there
show no miracles, but laid his hands upon a few sick folks, and healed
them, and he merueyled at their unbelief.

There is nothing without a man that can defyle him when it enters in to him,

Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self. There is none other commandment
greater then these.

And the Scrybe said unto him: well master thou have said the truth, that
there is one god, and that there is none but he. And to love him with all the
heart, and with all the mind, and with all the soul, and with all the strength,
and to love a man's neighbor as him self, is a greater thing then all burnt
offrynges and sacrifices. And when Jesus saw that he answered discretly, he
said unto him: * Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after

And many that were rich cast in much. And there came a certain poor wydow,

And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side

remained spechelesse.



When she saw him, she was abashed at his saying: and cast in her mind what

Marye, for thou have found grace with God. Lo, thou shalt conceive in thy
womb, and shall bear a son, and shall call his name Jesus. He shall be great,
and shall be called the son of the highest. And the Lord God shall give unto

For there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.

when men hate you, and thruste you out of their company, and rail, and
abhor your name as an evil thing, for the son of ma^s sake, Rejoice ye

manner, their fathers entreated the Prophets.

But woe be to you that are rich: that have therein your consolacion. Woe be to

Love your enemies. Do good to them which hate you. Bless them that curse
you. And pray for them, which wrongfullye trouble you. And unto him that

The parable is this. The sede is the word of God. Those that are beside the

son can do nothing of him self, but that he sees the father do. For what
so ever he does, yt does the son also. For the father loves ye son, and
shows him all what so ever he does. And he will show him greatter works
then these, so that ye shall maruayle. For as the father rayseth up the deed,
and quyckeneth the^, so the son also quyckeneth whom he will.

Verily, verily I say unto you: the hour is coming, and now is, when the
deed shall hear the voice of the son of God. And they that hear, shall live.
For as the father has life in him self, so has he given the son, to have
life in him self: and has given him power also to judge, in that he is the
son of man. Maruayle not at this: the hour shall come, in which all that
are in the graves, shall hear his voice, and shall come forth: they that have
done good, unto the resurrection of life: and they that have done evil, unto
the resurrection of damnacion.

which the father has given me to fynysshe: the same works that I do, bear
witness of me, that the father sent me. And the father him self which has
sent me, bears witness of me. Ye have not herd his voice at any time nor ye
have seen his shape: And his words have ye not abydinge in you For whom he

Then Jesus lift up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, and said
unto Philip: Whence shall we bye breed that these might eat. This he said to
prove him for him self knew what he would do.

Philip answered him, two hundred penye worth of bred are not sufficient for
them, that every one may take a little. Then said unto him one of his
disciples, Andrewe Simon Peter's brother. There is a ladde here, which has
five barley loaves and two fisshes: but what is that among so many? And
Jesus said: Make the people sit down: There was as much as they would.

When they had eat enough he said unto his disciples, gather up the broken
meat ye remains: that nothing be lost. And they gathered it together, and
filled twelve baskettes with the fragmentes, of the five barley loaves: which
remained unto them that had eaten. Then the men, when they had seen the
miracle that Jesus did, said: this is doubtless the Prophet that should come
into the world,

When Jesus perceived that they would come, and take him up to make him king,

And when even was come, his disciples went unto the sea, and entered into a
ship and went over the sea unto Capernaum. And anon it was darcke, and Jesus
was not come to them. And the sea arose with a great wynd that blewe. Now,
when they had rowen about

The day following, the people which stood on the other side of the sea, saw
that there was none other ship there, save that one into which his disciples
were entered, and that Jesus entered not with his disciples in ye ship: but
that his disciples were gone away alone. How be it, there came other ships
from Tiberias nygh unto the place, where they ate breed, when the Lord had
blessed. Then when the people saw that Jesus was not there, neither his
disciples, they also took shyppynge, and came to Capernau^, seeking Jesus.

And when they had found him, on the other side of the sea, they said unto
him: Rabbi, when came thou hither? Jesus answered them and said: Verily,
verily I say unto you: Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles: but
because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.

as it is written: He gave them breed from heaven to eat. Jesus said unto
the^: Verily, verily, I say unto you: Moses gave you not the breed from
heaven: but my father gives you the true breed from heaven. For the breed of
God is that comes down from heaven, and gives life unto the world.

Then said they unto him: Lord, evermore give us this bred. And Jesus said
unto them: I am the bred of life. Who comes to me, shall not honger: and who
believes in me shall never thurst.

But I said unto you: that ye have seen me, and yet believe not. All that the
father gives me, shall come to me: and him that comes to me, I cast not to
away. For I came down from heaven: not do mine own will, but his will which
has sent me. And this is the fathers will which has sent me, that of all
which he has given me, I should lose nothing: but should raise it up
again, at the last day. And this is the will of him that sent me: that every
man which seyth the son, and believes on him, have everlasting life, and I
will raise him up at the last day. The Jews then murmured at him, because he
said: I am the breed which is come down from Math.x. d Luce.x. d
No man can come to me, oneles the father which has sent me, draw him / and I
will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the Prophets,

that they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that has herd and
has learned of the father, comes unto me, not that any man has seen the
father, save he which is of God, he has seen the father.

Verily, verily, I say unto you, who believes on me, has everlasting life. I
am the breed of life. Your fathers did eat Manna in the wilderness and are
deed? This is that breed which comes from heaven, that one should eat of
it, and not dye. I am the living bred which came down from heaven.
If any man eat of this bred, he shall live for ever.

Then the Jews strove among them selves, saying: How can this man give his
flesh to eat? Jesus therefore said unto the^: Verily, verily I say unto
you, oneles ye eat the flesh of the son of man, and drink his blood, ye
have not life in you. Who so ever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has
eternal life: and I shall raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is
verily meat: and my blood is verily drink. Who eats my flesh and drynketh
my blood, dwells in me, and I in him. As the living father has sent me,
and I live by my father: so he that eats me, shall live by me. This is the
bred which came from heaven: not as your fathers have eaten Manna and are deed.
Who eats of this bred, shall live ever.

These said he in the Synagoge, as he taught in Capernaum. Many therefore of
his disciples: when they had herd this, said: This is an hard saying: Who
can hear him? Jesus knew in him self, that his disciples murmured at this,
and said unto them: before?
It is the sprete that quyckeneth, the flesh proffiteth nothing. The words
that I speak unto you, are sprete and life. But there are some of you that
believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning, which they were that believed
not, and who should betray him. And he said: therefore said I unto you: that no
man can come unto me, onles it were given unto him of my father.

From that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.
Then said Jesus to the twelve: will ye also go away? Simon Peter answered:

Jesus comes to Jerusalem at the feast, teaches the Jews, and reproves

does any thing secretly, and he him self seeks to be known openly. If thou
do such things, show thy self to the world. For as yet his brethren
believed not in him.

Then Jesus said unto them: My time is not yet come: but your time is all way
ready. The world can not hate you. But me it hates: because I testify of it,
that the works of it are evil. Go ye up unto this feast. I will not go up yet
unto this feast, for my time is

In the mids of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. And
the Jews marueyled, saying: How knows he the scriptures, whereas he never
learned? Jesus answered them, and said: My doctrine is not mine: but his that
sent me: If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether
it be of God, or whether I speak of my self. He that speaks of him self /
seeks his own praise. But he that seeks his praise that sent him, he is true,
and no vnrightwysnesse is in him.

am, ye know. And I am not come of my self, but he that sent me is true, whom
ye know not. I know him: for I am of him, and he has sent me. Then they
sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him / because his time was not
yet come. Many of the people believed on him, and said: When Christ comes,
shall he do mo miracles then this man has done?

The Pharisees herd that the people murmured

ministers answered: never man spoke as this man does. Then answered them the
Pharisees: are ye also brought into error? Does any of the rulars or of the
Pharisees believe on him? But this commune people which know not the law, are
cursed. Nicodemus said unto them, he that came to Jesus by night,
and was one of them. Does our law judge any man, before it hear him, and
know what he has done? They answered and said unto him: art thou also a
Galilean? Search and look, for out of Galile has arysen no Prophet. And
every man went unto his own house.

Jesus went up to the mount Olyuete, and early in the morning came again into
the temple, and all the people came unto him, and he sat down and taught
them. Now, the Scribes and Pharisees brought him a woman taken in aduoutry, and
setting her in ye mids, said unto him: Master, this woman was taken in
aduoutry, even as the deed was adoinge. Luce.xx. b Leuiti.xx.
Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned. What say thou
therefore? And this they said to tempte him: that they might have, whereof to
accuse him. Jesus stouped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. So
while they co^tynued asking him, he lift him self up, and said unto them:
The faulteles person of you, first cast the stone at her. And again he stouped
down, and wrote on the ground.
Neither do I condemn the. Go / and sin no more.

Then spoke Jesus again unto them, saying: I am the light of the world. He
that follows me, shall not walk in darckenesse: but shall have the light of
life. The Pharisees said unto him: thou bear record of thy self, thy
record is not true. Jesus answered and said unto them: though I bear record
of my self, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whyther I
goo. But ye can not tell whence I come, and whither I go. Ye judge after the
flesh, I judge no man. Deute.xix. b Matt.xviii. b ii. Cor.xiii. a Ebrewes.x. e
It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. I am
one that bear wytnes of my self, and the father that sent me, bears wytnes
of me. Then said they unto him: Where is thy father? Jesus answered: Ye
neither know me, nor yet my father. If ye had known me, ye should have known
my father also. These words spoke Jesus in the tresury, as he taught in the
temple, and no man laid hands on him, for his time was not yet come.

Then said Jesus again unto them: I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and
shall dye in your sins. Whyther I go, thither can ye not come. Then said
the Jews: will he kill him self / because he says: Whyther I go, thither can
ye not come? And he said unto them: Ye are from beneth, I am from above. Ye
are of this world, I am not of this world. I said therefore unto you, that ye
shall dye in your sins. For oneles ye believe that I am he, ye shall dye in
your sins.

Then said they unto him, Who art thou?

Jesus therefore said, to those Jews, which believed on him. If ye continue in
my words, then are ye my very disciples, and shall know the truth: and the
truth shall enfraunchise you. They answered him: We be Abraham's sede, and
were never bond to any man: Why say thou then, ye shall be made free.

glory / but there is one that seeks and judges.

Verily verily I say unto you, if a man keep my word, he shall never se

Pharysees: this man is not of God, because he keeps not the Soboth

The Jews therefore did not believe of the fellow, that he was blind, and
received his syghte, till they had called the parents of him that had
received syghte. And they asked them, saying: Is this your son, whom ye say
was borne blind? How does he now se then? His parents answered them and
said: We wot well that this is our son, and that he was borne blind: but
how he now sees we know not, or who has opened his eyes, can we not tell. He

Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him: Give God

blind, and now I se. Then said they to him again. What did he to the? How
opened he thine eyes? He answered

The man answered and said unto them: this is a merueylous thing, that ye wot

nothing. They answered and said unto him: thou art all together borne in

Jesus herd that they had cast him out: and as soon as he had found him, he
said unto him: do thou believe on the son of God? He answered and said:
Who is it Lord, that I might believe on him? And Jesus said unto him: Thou
haste him, and he it is that talks with the. And he said: Lord, I believe,
and worshypped him. Jesus said: I am come unto judgment into this world:
that they which se not, might se, and they which se, might be made blind.
And some of the Pharisees which were with him, herd these words and said unto
him: are we the^ blind? Jesus said unto them: If ye were blind, ye should
have no sin. But now ye say, we se, therefore your sin remains.

After that, said he to his disciples: let us go into Iewry again. His

Then gathered the high Prestes, and Pharisees a concile, and said: What do

believe on him and the Romans shall come and take away our country and the
people. But one of the^ named Cayphas being the high preaste of that year,
said unto them: Ye perceive nothing, nor yet consider that it is expedient
for us, that one man dye for the people, and not all the people perysshe. This

fathers has glorified his son Jesus, whom ye delivered and denied in the
presence of Pylate, when he had judged him to be losed. But ye denied the holy

life, who^ god has raised from death, of the which we are witnesses. And his
name through the faith of his name, has made this man sound, whom ye se and
know. And the faith which is by him, has given to him this health in the
presence of you all:

Prophets, how that Christ should suffer, he has thus wise fulfilled. Repent

For Moses said unto the fathers: Deuteronomy.xviii.c. Actu.vii. e
a Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, even of your brethren
like unto me: him shall ye hear, in all things what so ever he shall say unto
you. For the time shall come that every soul which shall not hear that same
Prophet, shall be destroyed out of the people. Also all the Prophets from
Samuel and thence forth, as many as have spoken have in likewise told of
these days.

Ye are the children of the prophets and of the testament, which God has
made unto our fathers, saying to Abraham: Testament) a covenant or promise.

When they saw the boldness of Peter and John^, and understood that they were
unlearned and lay people, they merueyled, and they knew them, that they were
with Jesus, and beholdynge also the man which was healed standing with them,
they could not say against it. But they commanded them to go aside out of
the concile, and cou^seyled among them selves saying: what shall we do to these

dwell in Jerusalem, and we can not deny it. But that it be noysed no farther

And they called them, and commanded

For we can not, but speak that which we have seen and herd. So thretned they

A Certain man named Ananias with Saphira his wife, sold a possession, and
kept away part of the price (his wife also being of counsel) and brought a
certain part, and laid it down at the apostles fete. The^ said Peter:
Ananias, how is it that Satan has filled thine heart, that thou sholdest lie
unto the holy ghost, and keep away part of the lyueloded. Pertayned it not unto

is it that thou have put this thing in thine heart? Thou have not lied unto

And it fortuned, as it were about the space of.iij. hours after, that his
wife came in, not knowing what was done. And Peter said unto her: Tell me,
gave ye the land for so much? And she said: yea, for so much. Then Peter
said unto her: Why have ye agreed together, to tempte the sprete of the Lord?
Behold the fete of them which have buried thy husband, are at the door / and
shall carye the out. Then she fell down, forthwith at his fete and yielded up
the ghost. And the young men came in, and found her deed, and carried her out,
and buried her by her husband. And great fear came on all the congregation,
and on as many as herd it.



Then the chief priest rose up, and all they that were with him (which is the
sect of the Sadduces) and were full of indignacion, and laid hands on the
apostles, and put them in the common prison. But the aungel of the lord by
night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said: go, step
forth, and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.
When they herd that, they entered in to the temple erly in the morning and
taught. The chief priest came, and they that were with him, and assembled the
concile and hole order of the elders of the children of Israel, and sent to the
prison to fet them. When the ministres came, and found them not in the prison,
they returned and told, saying: the prison found we shut as sure as was
possible, and the kepers standing without before the doors. But when we had
opened, we found no man with in. When the chief priest, and the ruler of the
temple, and the hye priests herd

But now came one, and showed them: behold the men that ye put in prison,
stand in the temple, and teach the people. Then went the ruler of the temple
with ministers, and brought them without violence. For they feared the people,
leest they should have been stoned. And when they had brought them, they set
the^ before the counsel. And the chief priest asked them, saying: Did not we
straytly command you ye should not teach in this name? And behold ye have
filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and ye intend to bring this man's blood

sins. And we are his records concerning these things, and also the holy
ghost, whom God has given to them that obey him. When they herd that, they
claue asunder, and sought to slay them. Then stood there up one in the
counsel, a Pharisey named Gamaliel, Gamaliel.
a doctor of law had in auctorite among all the people, and commanded to
put the Apostles aside a little space, and said unto them: men of Israel take heed to your selves what ye entende to do as touching these men. Before these
days rose up one Theudas bostynge him self, to much people after him. He also
perisshed, and al even as many as harkened to him, are scattered abroad.

And now I say unto you: refrain your selves from these men, let them
alone. For if this counsel or work be of men, it will come to naught. But if
it be of God, ye can not destroy it, lest happyly ye be found to strive
against God. Now to him they agreed, and called the apostles, and bet them, and
commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.

And they departed from the counsel reioysyng that they were counted worthy to
suffer rebuke for his name. And daily in the temple and in every house they
ceased not, teaching and preachinge Jesus Christ.

they should have fallen on some rock / they cast four ancres out of the
stern, and wysshed for the day.

As the shyppemen were about to flee out of the ship, and had let down
the boat into the sea, under a couloure as though they would have cast ancres

And in the mean time, between that and day, Paul besought them all to take
meat, saying: This is the fourtenth day that ye have tarried and continued
fasting, receyuinge nothing at all. Wherefore I pray you take meat: for this
no doubt, is for your health: for there shall not an hear fall from the

hundred three score and syxtene souls. And when they had eaten enough, they
lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.



The Souldyers counsel, was to kill the prisoners, least any of them, when he

Paul, kept them from their purpose, and commanded that they that could

CAPI. I.


To all you of Rome beloved of God, and saints by calling. Grace with you, and
peax from

First I thank my god through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is
publysshed throughout all the world. For god is my witness, whom I serve with my
sprete in the gospel of his son, that without ceasing I make mention of you
always in my prayers, besechyng that ones at last, a prosperous journey by the
will of god) might fortune me, to come unto you. For I long to se you, that I
might bestow among you some ghostly gift to strength you with / that is,
that I might be comforted together with you, through the common faith, which
both ye and I have.

I would ye should know brethren that I have often times purposed to come unto
you (but have been let hitherto) to have some fruit among you, as I have among
other of the Gentyles. For I am detter both to the Greeks, and to them which
are no Greeks, unto the learned, and also unto the unlearned. Likewise as much

I am ready to preach the gospel to you of Rome also. For I am not ashamed of
the gospel of Christ, because it is the power of god for salvation to all that
believe, namely to the Jew, and also to the hethen. For by it the ryghtousnes
of god is opened from ph faith to faith. As it is written: ^ac.ii. a
the just shall live by faith.



And as it seemed not good unto them to be a known of god, even so god
delivered them up unto a leude mind, that they should do tho things which
were not comely, being full of all vnrightous doing, of fornicacion,
wickedness, covetousness, maliciousnes, full of envy, murder, debate,
disceyte, evil condycioned, whyspereds, backbiters, haters of god, doers of
wrong, proud, bosters, bryngers up of evil things, disobedient to father
and mother, without understanding, covenant breakers, vnlouynge,
trueebreakers, and merciles. Which men though they knew the ryghtousnesse of
god, how that they which commyt such things are worthy of death, Osee.vii. a

Therefore art thou inexcusable, o man, To Judge, here (as in many other places)

iudgest. For in that thou iudgest an other, thou condemnest thy self. For
thou that iudgest, do even the same. But we are sure that the judgment of
god is according to the troth, against them which commit such things.
Thynkest thou this, o thou man that iudgest them which do such things, and
yet do the very same, that thou shall escape the judgment of god? Either
despysest thou the riches of his goodness, patience, and long sufferaunce? and
remembrest not how that the kyndnes of God leads the to repentance?

But thou after thine hard heart yt can not which will reward every man
according to his deeds, Psalm.lxii.
that is to say, praise, honor, and immortality to them which continue in
good doing, and seek eternal life. But unto them that are rebellions and
disobey the truth, and follow i^iquite, shall come indignacion and wrath,
tribulacion and anguysh upon the soul of every man that does evil: of the
Jew first, and also of the Gentyle. To every man that does good, shall come
praise, honor, and peax: to the Jew first, and also to the Gentyle. For there
is no parcialitie with God. But who so ever has sinned without law, shall
perisshe without law. And as many as have sinned under the law, shall be
judged by the law. For before God they are not ryghtous which hear the law:
but the doers of the law shall be justified. For if the Gentyles which have
no law, do of nature those things contained in the law: then they having no
law, are a law unto them selves, which show the deed of the law written in
their hertes: while

Behold, thou art called a Jew, and trustest in the law, and reioysest in
god, and know his will, and have experience of good and bad, in that thou
art informed by the law, and bileuest that thou thy self art a guide unto the
blind, a light to them which are in darcknes, an informer of them which
lack discrecion, a teacher of unlearned, which have the form of that which
ought to be known, and of the troth in the law. But thou which teach an
other teach not thy self. Thou preachest a man should not steal, and yet
thou stealest. Thou Esaye.lvii. a. Eze.xxxvi. d.
as it is written.

Circumcision verily avails if thou keep the law. But if thou break the
law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. Therefore if the uncircumcised
keep the right things contained in the law: shall not his uncircumcision be
counted for circumcision? And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature (if
it keep the law) judge the, which being under the letter and circumcision,
do transgress the law? For he is not a Jew, which is a Jew outward.
Neither is that thing circumcision which is outward in the flesh. But he is
a Jew which is hyd within, and the circumcision of the heart is the true
circumcision, which is in spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not
of men, but of God.

He shows what preferment the Jews have, and that both the Jews and
Gentyles are under sin, and are justified only by the grace of God in
Christ.

CAPI. III.
WHat preferment then has the Jew? Psalm.cxv. ^ Psalmo.l. ^
and all men liars, as it is written: yt thou might be justified in thy
saying, and sholdest overcome when thou art judged.

If our vnryghtousnes make the ryghtousnesse

What say we then? Are we better then they? No, in no wise / for we have already
proved how Psalm.xiii. a and v a
they are al gone out of the way, they are all unprofitable / there is none
that does good, no not one. Psalm.v.
Their throat is an open sepulcre, with their tongues they have disceyued: the
poison of aspes is under their lyppes. Whose mouths are full of cursynge and
bitterness. Psa.xcxxxii. ^ Psalmo.ix. ^. Prophet* i. ^ Esaias.lix. a Psalm.xxxv. ^
Their fete are swyft to shed blood. Destruction and wretchedness are in their
ways. And the way of peax they have not known. There is no fear of God
before their eyes.

We know that what so ever the law says, he says it to them which are under
the law. That all mouths may be stopped, and all the world be subdued to God,
because that by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in the
syghte of God. For by the law comes the knowledge of sin.


Now the ryghtousnes that comes of God, is declared without the fulfyllynge
of the law, having witness of the law, and of the Prophets. The
rightousnes no doubt which is good before God, comes by the faith, of
Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all that believe.

There is no difference: for all have sinned, and lack the glory of God: but

to show the rightousnes which before him is of valor, in that he forgyueth
the sins that are past, which God did suffer to show at this time the
rightousnes that is allowed of him, that he might be counted just, and a
iustifier of him which bileueth on Jesus.

Where is then thy reioysynge? It is excluded. By what law? by the law of
works? Nay, but by the law of faith.


Therefore we hold that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the
law. Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also the God of the Gentyles?
Yes of the Gentyles also? For it is God only, which shall iustifye
circumcision of faith, and uncircumcision through faith. Do we then destroy
the law through faith? God forbid. But we rather establysshe the law.

He declares by the example of Abraham, that faith justifies, and not the law
nor the works thereof.

CAPI. IIII.
(...).xv. b
For what says the scripture? Abraham bileued God, and it was counted unto him
for rightousnes. To him that works is the reward not reckened of favor, but
of duty. To him that works not, but byleueth on him that justifies the
ungodly, his faith is counted for ryghtousnes. Even as David descrybeth the
blessedness of the man, unto whom God ascribes ryghtousnes without deeds.
(...) xxi. a
Blessed are they, whose vnryghtousnes are forgyuen, and whose sins are

Came this blessedness then upon the circumcised, or upon the uncircumcised? We

reckened? in the time of circumcision? or in the time before he was

Not in the time of circumcision: but when he was yet uncircumcised. And he

because they are circumcised only, but because they walk also in the steps
of ye faith that was in our father Abraham, before the time of circumcision.

(...).iij. a
be heirs, then is faith but vain, and the promise of none effect, because
the law causes wrath / for where no law is, there is no transgression.
Therefore by faith is the inheritance given, that it might come of favor, and
the promise might be sure to all the seed. Not to them only which are of the
law, but also to them which are of the faith of Abraham, which is the father
of us all. As it is written: (...). a
I have made the a father to many nations, even before God whom thou have
byleued which quickens the deed, and calls those things which be not, as
though they were.

Genesis.xv. a
And he faynted not in the faith, nor yet considered his own body which was
now deed, even when he was almost an hundred year old: ne yet that Sara was
past child bearing. He stackered not at the promise of God through vnbylefe,
but was made strong in the faith, and gave honor to God, full certified, that
what he had promised, that he was hable to make good. And therefore was it
reckened to him for rightousnes.

It is not written for him only, that it was reckened to him for ryghtousnes,
but also for us, to whom it shall be counted for rightousnes, so that we believe
on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from death: Which was given for our
sins, and rose again for to iustifye us.

The power of faith, hope and love: and how death raygned from Adam unto
Christ, by whom only we have forgyuenes of sins.

CAPI. V.
Because therefore we are justified by faith,
by whom we have a way in through faith, unto his grace, wherein we stand and
rejoice in hope of the praise that shall be given of God: Neither do we so
only: but also we rejoice in tribulacion. Knowing that tribulacion brings
patience, patience experience, experience brings hope. And hope makes not
ashamed, for the love of God is shed abroad in our hertes by the holy ghost,
which is given unto us.

For when we were yet weyke according to the time: Christ dyed for us which
were ungodly, yet scace will any man dye for a rightous man. Perauenture for a
good man durst a man dye. But God sets out his love

For if when we were enemies, we were reconcyled to God by the death of his
son: much more seeing we are reconcyled, we shall be preserved by his life.
Not only so, but we also joy in God by our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we
have received the atonement.

Wherefore as by one man sin entered in to Adams disobedience dampened us all er
we our selves wrought evil And Christ's obedience saves us all, er we our
selves work any good.


But the gift is not like as the sin. For if through the syn of one, many be
deed: much more plenteous upon many was the grace of God and gift by grace,
which grace was given by one man Jesus Christ.

And the gift is not over one sin, as death came through one sin of one that
sinned / for damnacion came of one sin unto condemnacion: but the gift came
to iustifye from many

Likewise then as by the sin of one, conde^nacion came on all men:
even so by the justifying of one comes the rightousnes that brings life
upon al men. For as by one ma^s disobedience many became sinners: so by the
obedience of one, shall many be made rightous. But the law in the mean time
entered in, that sin should increase. Nevertheless where abundance of sin
was, there was more plenteousnes of grace: to the intent yt as sin had reigned
unto death, even so might grace reygne through ryghtousnes unto eternal life,
by the help of Jesus Christ.

For as much as we be delivered through Christ from sin, we must fassion
our selves to live as the servants of God, and not after our own lusts. The

Let not sin reygne therefore in your mortal bodies, that ye should thereunto

What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace?
God forbid. Remember ye not that to whom so ever ye commyt your selves as
servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey: whether it be of
sin unto death, or of obedience unto rightousnes? God be thanked,

I speak after man's fassion, because of the infirmity of your flesh. For as
ye have given your members, servants to uncleanness and to wickedness, runninge
out of one wickedness in to an other: even so now give your members servants
unto rightousnes, that ye may be sanctified. For when ye were the servants of
syn, ye were not under ryghtousnes. What fruit had ye then, in tho things
whereof ye are now ashamed? For the end of them is death. But now being
delivered from sin, and made the servants of God: ye have your fruit to be
sanctified,
and the end everlasting life, for the reward of sin is death: but eternal

For the very creature shall be delivered from the bondage of corrupcion in

them he also gloryfied.

What shall we then say to these things? if God be on our side: who can be

sword? As it is written: for thy sake are we killed all day long,
Psalm.xliij. d

things we overcome strongly through his help that loved us. For I am sure,
that neither death neither life, neither angels, nor rule, ne power, neither

other creature shall be hable to part us from the love of God, which is in
Christ Jesus our Lord.

which is God over all, blessed for ever. Amen.

I speak not of these things as though the words of God had take none
effect. For they Gene.xxi. b

Exo.xxxiij. d.
Is there any vnryghtousnes with God. No, not so. For he says to Moses: I will
show mercy, to whom I show mercy: and will have compassion on whom I have
compassion.
So lies it not then in a man's will or running, Exodi.ix. d
but in the mercy of God. For the scripture says unto Pharao, even for this
same purpose have I stered the up, to show my power on the, and that my name
might be declared thorowoute all the world. So has he mercy on whom he woll,
and whom he woll, he makes hard herted.

Thou wylt say then unto me: why then blames he us yet? For who can resist
his will? But O man, what art thou which disputest with God? Shall the work

I will call them my people which were not my people: and her beloved which
was not beloved. And it shall come to pass in the place where it was said
unto the^, ye are not my people: that there shall be called the children of the
living God.

But Esaye cries for Israel, Esaye.x. e

had been lykened to Gomorra.

What shall we say then? We say the gentyles which followed not ryghtwysnes
have overtaken ryghtwysnes:
I mean the ryghtwisnes which comes of faith. But Israel which followed the
law of ryghtewysnes, could not attain unto the law of ryghtewysnes. And
wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith: but as it were by the works of
the law. For they have stombled at the stomblynge stone. As it is written:
Esaye.viij.c. and xxviij. d.i. Petri.ij. ^.
Behold I put in Sion a stomblynge stone, and a rock which shall make men

All the Jews are not cast away, therefore Paul warns the Gentyls that be
called, not to be high minded nor to despise the Jews, for the judgments of
God are deep and secret.

CAPI. XI.
I Say then: Has God cast away his people? God forbid. For even I am an

I say then: have they therefore stombled, that they should but faule only?
God forbid: but through their faule is salvation happened unto the gentyls, to
provoke the^ with. Wherefore if the faule of them, be the riches of the world:
and the mynysshynge of them the riches of the gentyles: How much more should it
be so, if they all believed. I speak to you Gentyles, in as much as I am the
Apostle of the Gentyles, I will magnify mine office, that I might provoke them
which are my flesh, and might save some of them. For if the casting away of
them, be the reconcelynge of the world: what shall the receyuynge of them be,
but life again from death? For if the begynnynges be holy,
ye hole heepe is holy. And if the rote be holy, the branches are holy also.

out of a natural wild olyue tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature in a
true Olyue tree: how much more shall the natural branches be grafted in their
own olyue tree again

I would not that this mysterye should be hyd from you my brethren, least ye

For the gifts and calling of God are such that it can not repent him of
them: for as ye in time past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy
through their unbelief: even so now have they not believed the mercy which is
happened unto you, that they also may obtain mercy.
God has wrapped all nacyons in unbelief, that he might have mercy on all.

O the depenes of the riches and wisdom, and knowledge of God: how

And all that is not of faith is sin.

the liberalite of our Lord Jesus Christ, which though he were rich, yet for

For this we eschew, that any man should rebuke us in this plenteous

things, not in the sight of God only, but also in the sight of men.

We have sent with them a brother of ours whom we have often times proved
diligent in many things, but now much more diligent. The great confydence
which I have in you, has caused me this to do: partly for Titus sake, which
is my fellow and helper as concerning you, partly because of other which are
our brethren and ye messengers of the co^gregacions, and the glory of Christ.
Wherefore show unto them a proof of your love, and of the reioysyng that we have

chief, lest it should have been thought that I should run, or had run in
vain. Also Titus which was with me, though he were a Greek, yet was not
compelled to be circumcised, because of incommers being false brethren, which

Of them which seemed to be great (what they were in time past it makes no

But contrary wise when they saw that the gospel over the uncircumcision was
committed unto me, as the gospel over the ph circumcision was unto Peter: for
he that was mighty in Peter in the Apostleshyp over the circumcision, the same
was mighty in me among the Gentiles: and therefore when they perceived the
grace that was given unto me, then James, Cephas and John^, which seemed to be
pylers, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands, and agreed with us, that we
should preach among the hethen, and they among the Jews: warning only
that we should remember the poor. Which thing also I was diligent to do.

And when Peter was come to Antioche, I withstode him in the face. For he was

For er that certain came from James, he ate with the Gentyles. But when they

was brought in to their simulacion also. But when I saw that they went not
the right way after the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before all
men,
if thou being a Jew, lyuest after the manner of the Gentyles and not as do
the Jews, why causest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews? We which are
Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentyles, know that a man is not

byleued on Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ,
and not by the deeds of the law, because that by the deeds of the law no

O Folysshe Galathians, who has bewitched you, that ye should not bileue the

ye have begone in the spirit, ye would now end in the flesh? So many

that the blessyng of Abraham might come on the Gentyles through Jesus Christ,
and that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith.

Brethren, I will speak after the manner of men. Though it be but a man's
testament, yet no man despyseth it, or addeeh any thing thereto, when it is
ones allowed. To Abraham and his seed, were the promyses made. He says not in
the seeds, as many: but in thy seed, as in one, which is Christ. This I say,
that the law which began afterward, beyond four hundred and thyrtye years,
does not disannull the testament that was confermed before of God unto
Chrystewarde, to make the promise of none effect. For if the inheritance come
of the law, it comes not of promise. But God gave it unto Abraham by
promise.

Wherefore then serves the law? The law was added because of transgression
(till the seed came, to whom ye promise was made) and it was ordained by
angels in the hand of a mediator. A mediator is not a mediator of one. But
God is one. Is the law then against the promise of God? God forbid. How beit

scripture concluded all things under sin, that the promise by the faith of
Jesus Christ should be given unto them that believe. Before

Wherefore the law was our scholemaster unto Christ, that we might be made
ryghtous by faith. But after that faith is come, now are we no longer under
a scholemaster. For ye are all the sons of God by the faith which is in
Christ Jesus. For all ye that are baptized, have put on Christ. Now is there
no Jew, neither Gentyle: there is neither bond, ne fre: there is neither man
ne woman: but ye are all one thing in Christ Jesus. If ye be Christ's, then
are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs by promise.

loving unto the poor Christen in their persecucion, shows the unkind
dealing of Dyotrephes, and the good reaporte of Demetrius.

THe elder unto the beloved

Beloved, thou do faithfully what so ever thou do to the brethren, and to
strangers, which bare witness of thy love before all the congregation. Which
brethren when thou bring forwards of their journey (as it besemeth God)
thou shall do well: because that for his names sake they went forth, and

I wrote unto the congregation: but Diotrephes which loves to have the
preemine^ce among them, receives us not. Wherefore if I come, I will declare
his deeds which he does, jesting on us with malicious words,

Beloved, follow not the evil, but the good. He that does well, is of God:
but he that does evil sees not God. Demetrius has good reaporte of all men
and of the truth: yea and we our selves also bear record, and ye know that
our record is true. I have many things to write: but I will not with ynke and
pen write unto the. For I trust I shall shortly se the, and we shall speak
mouth to mouth. Peax be with the. The friends salute the. Great the friends by
name.

The Epistle unto the Hebreues.
How God dealte louyngly with them of the old time in sendynge them his

He exhorts us to be obedyent unto the new law, which Christ has given
us, and not to be offended at the infyrmyte and low degree of Christ, because
it was necessary, that for our sakes, he should take such an humble state
upon him, that he might be like unto his brethren.

CAPI. II.
Wherefore we ought to give the more If the despysers of Moses were so
grievously punysshed, what shall become of the^ that make a mock of Christ.
how shall we escape, if we despise so great salvation, which at the first
began to be preached of the Lord him self, and afterward was confermed upon
us, by them that herd it, God bearing witness thereto, both with signs and
wonders also, and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost,
according to to his own will.

He has not unto the Angels put in subjection the world to come, whereof we
speak. But one in a certain place witnesses, saying. What is man, that thou
art Psalm.viii.c
or the son of man that thou do vyset him? Thou madeste him lower for a
season then the angels: thou crounedst him with honor and glory, and haste
set him above the works of thy hands. Thou have put all things in subjection
under his feet. In that he put all things under him, he left nothing that
is not put under him. Nevertheless we yet se not all things subdued, but him
that was made less then the Angels, we se that it was Jesus / which is
crowned with glory and honor for the sufferynge of death: that he by the
grace of God, should taste of death for all

For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things,
after that he had brought many sons unto glory, that he should make the
Lord of their salvation perfect through suffrynge. For he that sanctifies,
and they which are sanctified, are all of one. For which cause he is not
ashamed to call them brethren, saying: Psalm.xxi.c.
I will declare thy name unto my brethren, and in the mids of the
congregation will I praise the. And again: I will put my trust in him. And
again: Psalm.xvii. a
behold here am I, and the children which God has given me.

For as much then as the children were partetakers of flesh and blood,
Esaye.viii. d.
he also him self likewise took part with them, to put down through death,
Oze.xiii. d.
him that had rule over death, that is to say the devil, and that he
might deliver them, which through fear of death were during their hole
life in danger of bondage. For he in no place takes on him the angels: but
the seed of Abraham takes he on him. Wherefore in all things it became him to
be made like unto his brethren, that he might be merciful, and a faithful
bishop in things concerning God, to pourge the peoples sins. For in that
he him self suffered and was temted, he is hable to soucour them that are
tempted.

He requires us to be obedyent unto the word of Christ, which is more
worthy then Moses. The punysshment of such as will needs harden their hearts.

he said to the other, Ps.xciiii. d.

he verily long after that the works were made and the foundation of the
world laid. For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day, on this
wise: And God * did rest the seventh day from all his works.

Seeing therefore it follows that some must enter thereinto, and they to whom
it was first preached, entered not therein for their unbelief: Again he
appointed in David a certain present day after so long a time / saying as
it is rehearsed: this day if ye hear his voice, be not herd herted. For if

cease from his own works, as God did from his.

Let us study therefore to enter into that rest, least any man fall after the
same exemple, into unbelief For the word of God is quick, and mighty in
operacion, and sharper then any two edge sword: and enters through,
even unto the dyuidinge a sonder of the soul and the spirit, and of the
joints and the Ecclesi.xv. b. Psalm.xxxiii.c.
For all things are naked and bare unto the eyes of him, of whom we speak.

Christ is our high priest, and seat of grace, and more excellent then the
high priests of the old law.

CAPI. V.
Seeing then that we have a great high

For every high priest taken out of men is ordained for men, in things
pertaining to God: to offer gifts and sacrifices for sin: which can have
compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way, because he
him self also is compased with infirmity: and for this infirmities sake he is
bound to offer for sins, as well for his own part, as for the peoples. And
no man takes honor unto him self, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.

Even so likewise, Christ glorified not him i. Par.xxiii. b. Psalmo.ii. b.
but he that said unto him: * Thou art my son, this day begat I the,
glorified him. As he also in an other place speaks: Psalm.cix. b.
* Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedech.

Which The daye^ of his flesh sygnyfye, the time of his humanyte.
in the days of his flesh, did offer up prayers and supplications, with
strong cryenge and tears unto him that was hable to save him from death and
was also herd, because of his Godlynes. And though he were Gods son, yet
learned he obedience, by tho things which he suffered, and was made perfect,
and the cause of everlasting salvation unto all them that obey him: and is
called of God an high priest, after the order of Melchisedech.


and not of strong meat: for every man that is fed with milk, is unskillful
of the word of righteousness. For he is but a babe. But strong meat
belongs to them that are perfect, which through custom have their wits
exercised, to judge both good and evil.

He goes forth with the thing that he began in the latter end of
the.v.chapter and exhorts them not to faint, but to be steadfast and pacient:
since God is sure in his promysse.

CAPI. VI.

And so will we do, if God permit. For it is not possible that they which
were ones lyghted, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were become
partetakers of the holy ghost, and have tasted of the good word of God, and of
the power of the world to come: if they fall, should be renewed again into
repentance, crucyfyenge unto them selves again the son of God and making a
mock of him.



For when God made promise to Abraham: Two immutable things: the promise and
the oath.
immutable things (in which it was impossible that God shuolde lie) we might
have perfect consolacion, which have fled, for to hold fast the hope that is
set before us, which we have as an ancre of the soul, both sure and steadfast,
and entering in, into tho things which are within the veil, into which the
forerunner is entered in, I mean Jesus that is made an high priest for ever,
after the order of Melchisedech.

He compares the presthode of Christ unto Melchisedech, but to be far more
excellent.

CAP. VII.
THis Melchisedech, king of Salem, Genes, xiiii. d.
(which being Preeste of the most high God, met Abraham, as he returned
from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him: to whom also Abraham gave
tithes of all things) first is by interpretation king of ryghtwysnesse:
after that he is king of Salem, that is to say, king of peax: without father
without mother, without kynne, and has neither beginning of his days,
neither yet end of his life: but is lykened unto the son of God, and
contynueth a preeste for ever. Consider what a man this was unto whom the
Patriarch Abraham gave tithes of the spoils. And verily those children of
Leui, which receive the office of the priests, have a commandment to take
according to the law, tithes of the people that is to say, of their
brethren, yea though they spronge out of the loins of Abraham. But he whose
kynred is not counted among them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him
that had the promyses. And without

If now therefore perfection came by the presthode of the Leuytes (for under
that presthode the people received the law) what neded it further more that an
other pressed should arise, after the order of Melchysedech, and not after the
order of Aaron? For if the presthode be translated, then of necessity must the
law be translated also.

For he of whom these things are spoken, pertayneth unto an other trybe, of
which never man served at the altar. For it is euidente that our Lord
spronge of the trybe of Judah, of which trybe, Moses spoke nothing concerning
presthode. And it is yet a Melchisedech there arise an other priest, which is
not made after the law of the carnal commandment: but after the power of
the endless life. (For he testifyeth: Psalm.cix.c
Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedech). Then the
commandment that went before, is disanulled, because of her weakness, and
vnprofytablenes. For the law made nothing perfect: but was an inducement of
a better hope, by which, we draw nyghe unto God.

And for this cause it is a better hope, that it was not promised without an
oath. For those priests were made without oath, but this priest with an oath,
by him that said unto him. The Lord swear, and will not repent: Thou art a
priest for ever after the order of Melchisedech. And for that cause was

And among them many were made priests, because they were not suffered to
endure by the reason of death. But this man, because he endures ever, has an
everlasting presthode. Wherefore he is hable also ever to save them that come
unto God by him, for as much as he ever lives, to make intercession for us.

For such an high Priest it became us to have which is holy, harmless,
undefiled, severed from sinners, and made higher then heaven. Which needs not
daily (as yonder high priests) to offer up sacrifices first for his own
sins, and then for the peoples sins. For that did he ones for all, when he
offered up him self. Christ ones sacrificed, purged all sins
For the law makes me^ Priests, which have weakness: but the word of the
oath that came sythens the law makes the son priest, which is perfect for
evermore.

The office of Christ is more worthy then the prestes office of the old
law, which was imperfect, and therefore abrogate.

Exodi.xv. d.


But now has he obtained a more excellent office, in as much as he is
mediator of a better testament, which was made for better promyses. For if that
first testament had been fautelesse: then should no place have been sought for
the second. For in rebukinge them he says: Hiere.xxxi. d

The profit and worthynes of the old Testament and how far the new
excels it.

CAPI. IX.
THat first tabernacle therefore had ordynaunces, Exo.xxvi. a and.xxxvi. a
For there was a fore tabernacle made, wherein was the candelsticke and the
table, and the show bred which is called holy. But with in the second veil
was there a tabernacle, which is called the holy of holyes, which had the
golden senser and the arcke of the testament ouerlayde round about with
gold, wherein was the golden pot with Manna, and Aaro^s rod that spronge, and
the tables of the testament.

When these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the
first tabernacle and executed the service of God. But into the second went the
high priest alone, ones a year: and not without blood, which he offered for
him self, and for the ignorance of the people. Whereby the holy ghost this
signified

But Christ being Bishop of good things to come, came by a greatter and a
more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands:
that is to say, not of this manner buyldinge, neither by the blood of gootes
and calves:
For if the blood of oxen and of gotes, and the ashes of an heyfer, when it
was sprynkled, puryfyed the unclean, as touching the puryfyenge of the
flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ (which through the eternal
spirit, offered him self without spot to God) pourge your consciences from
deed works, to serve the living God?

And for this cause is he mediator of the new testament, that through death
which chanced for the redemption of those transgressions that were in the
first Testament, they which were called, might receive the promise of
eternal inheritance. For ^es.xxiiii.c
he took the blood of calves and of gotes, with water and purple, woolle and
ysope, and sprinkled ^rodi.xii.c (...).xiiii.c
* This is the blood of the testamente which God has appointed unto you.
Moreover, he sprenkled the tabernacle with blood also, and all the ministringe
vessels. And also almost all things, are by the law pourged with blood, and
without sheadynge of blood is no remission.

It is then need that the resemblaunces of heavenly things, be purifyed with
such things: but the heavenly things them selves are puryfyed with better
sacrifyces then are those.
For Christ is not entered into the holy places that are made with hands,
which are but fygures of true things: but is entered into very heaven, to
appear now in the ^oma.v. b. ^etri.iii. d.
* even so Christ was ones offered to take away the sins of many, and unto
them that look for him, he shall appear again without sin unto salvation.

The old law had no power to cleanse away sin: but Christ did it with
offering of his body ones for all. An exhortacion to receive this goodness
of God, thankfullye, with pacyence, and steadfast faith.

CAPI. X.

and not the things (...).xvi.c
in their own fassion can never with the sacrifices which they offer year by
year continually, make the comers thereunto perfect For would not then those
sacrifices have ceased to have been offered, because that the offerers being
ones pourged should have had no more conscience of sins. Nevertheless in
those sacrifices is there mencyon made of sins every year. Leuit.xvi.c
For it is impossible that ye blood of oxen and of gotes should take away
sins.

Wherefore when he comes into the world, he says. * Sacrifice and offering
Psalm.xxxix. b.
but a body haste thou ordained me. In sacrifices and synneofferynges thou have
no lust, Then I said: Loo I come, in the chiefest of the book it is written of
me, that I should do thy will, O God. Above, when he had said sacrifice and
offering, and burnt sacrifices, and synneofferynges thou would not have,
neither have allowed (which yet are offered by the law) and then said: Loo I
come to do thy will, O God: he takes away the first to stablysshe ye latter.
By which will, we are sanctified: by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ
ones for all. Christ's body is but once offered.


And every priest is ready daily ministringe, and often times offreth one manner
of offringe Psalm cix. a
For with one offeringe has he made perfect for ever them that are
sanctified. And the holy ghost also bears us record of this, even when he
told before: Hiere xxxi. f
This is the testament that I will make unto them: after those days, says
the Lord.
I will put my laws in their hertes and in their mind I will write them, and
their sins and wyckednesses will I remember no more. And where remission of
these things is, there is no more offringe for sin.

Seeing brethren that by the means of the

For if we sin willyngly after that we have received the knowledge of the
truth / there remains no more sacrifyce for sins, but a fearful lokynge
for judgment, and violent fire, which shall devour the adversaries. He that
despyseth Moses law, dies without mercy under two or three witnesses. Of how
much sorer punishment suppose ye, shall he be counted worthy, which treads
under foot the son of God: and counts ye blood of the testament as an
unholy thing wherewith he was sanctified, and does dishonor Deuteronomy.xxxii. e
Vengeance belongs unto me, I will recompense says the Lord. And again:
the Lord shall judge his people. It is a fearful thing to fall into the
hands of the living God.

Call to remembrance the days that are passed, in which after ye had
received light, ye endured a great fight in adversities, partly while all men
wondered and gased at you for the shame and tribulacion that was done unto you,
and partly, while ye became compagnions of them which so passed their time. For
ye suffered also with my bonds, and took in good worth the spoylynge of your
gooddes, and that with gladness: knowinge in your selves that ye had in
heaven a better and an endurynge substance. Cast not away Abac.ii. a.
For ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye

which withdraw our selves unto damnacion, but we appartayne to faith, to the
winning of the soul.

enjoy the pleasures of sin for a ceason, and esteemed the rebuke of Christ,
greatter richesse then the treasure of Egypt. For he had respect unto the
reward.

By Faith, he forsook Egypt, and feared not the fearcenesse of the king. For

And what shall I more say, the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, of Barach,

fire, escaped the edge of the sword, of weak were made strong, waxed
valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the alientes. And the women

And these all, through Faith, obtained good reaporte, and received not the

IVdas servant of Jesus

Beloved, when I gave all dilygence to write unto you of the commen salvation,
it was needful for me to write unto you, to exhort you, that ye should
continually labor in the faith which was ones given unto the saints. For
there are certain craftily crepte in, of which it was written before time unto
such judgment. They are ungodly and turn the grace of our God unto
wantonness, and deny God the only Lord, and our Lord Jesus Christ.

My mind is therefore to put you in remembrance, for as much as ye ones know
this, that the Lord (after he had delivered the people out of Egypt) Numer

destroyed them which afterward byleued not. The angel
but left their own habitacion: he has reserved in everlasting chains under

defiled them selves with fornicacion, and followed Strange flessh, that is

everlasting fire. Likewise these dremers defile the flesh, despise rulers,

thanks Lord, God almighty: which art, and wast, and art to come, for thou
have received thy great might, and have reigned. And the nations were angry,
and thy wrath is come, and the time of the deed, that they should be judged,
and that thou sholdest give reward unto thy servants the prophets and
saints and to them that fear thy name small and great, and sholdest destroy
them which destroy the earth. And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and

cast down which accused them before God day and night. And they overcame him
by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their witness, and they loved not
their lives unto the death. Therefore rejoice heuens, and ye that dwell in them.

And when the dragon saw, that he was cast unto the earth, he pursued the
woman, which brought forth the man child. And to the woman were given two
wings of a great egle, that she might flee in to the wyldernes, in to her
place, where she is nourysshed for a time, times, and half a time, from the
presence of the serpent. And the dragon cast out of his mouth water after the
woman as it had been a river, because she should have been caught of the floode.
And the earth help the woman, and the earth opened her mouth and swalowed up
the river, which the dragon cast out of his mouth. And the dragon was wroth
with the woman: and went and made war with the remnaunt of her seed, which
hepe the commandments of God, and have the testimonye of Jesus Christ. And I

like a lamb, and he spoke as did the dragon. And he did all that the first
be could do in his presence, and he caused the earth, and them which dwell
therein, to worship the first be, whose deedly wound was healed. And he did
great wonders, so that he made fire come down from heaven in the sight of men.
And disceyued them that dwelte on the earth by the means of those signs

in the cup of his wrath. And he shall be punysshed in fire and brymstone,
before the holy angels, and before the lamb.

And the smoke of their torment ascended up evermore. And they have no rest day
nor night which worship the beast and his image and and who so ever receives
the prynte of his name. Here is the patience of saints. Here are they that
keep the commandments and the faith of Jesus.

And I herd a voice from heaven, saying unto me: write. Blessed are the deed,

power over fire, and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp
syckle, and said: thruste in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the
earth, for her grapes are ripe. And the angel thrust in his sickle on the
earth, and cut down the grapes of the vyneyarde of earth, and cast in to them in
