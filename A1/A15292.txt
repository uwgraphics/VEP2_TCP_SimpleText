CANTVS. Of Duos, or Songs for two voices, composed and made by Thomas
Whythorne Gent. Of the which, some be plain and easy to be sung, or played on
Musical Instruments, and be made for young beginners of both those sorts. And
the rest of these Duos be made and set forth for those that be more perfect in
singing or playing as aforesaid, all the which be divided into three parts.
That is to say: The first, which does begin at the first song, are made for a
man and a child to sing, or otherwise for voices or Instruments of Music,
that be of the like compass or distance in sound. The second, which does begin
at the XXIII. song, are made for two children to sing. Also they be aptly made
for two treble Cornets to play or sound: or otherwise for voices or Musical
Instruments, that be of the like compass or distance in sound. And the third
part which does begin at the XXXVIII. song, (being all Canons of two parts in
one) be of diverse compasses or distances, and therefore are to be used with
voices or Instruments of Music accordingly.

IN VERITATE VICTORIA



To the right worshipful, ma^ter Francis Hastings, brother to the right
honorable, and most noble Earl of Huntington, Thomas Whythorne wishes all
godly felicity, and life everlasting, in Jesus Christ our only Savior.
Having understanding (right worshipful sir) that neither before, nor since
that I published in print Music for three, four and five voices, which is now
almost twenty years past, there has not any one of our nation published in
print any Music for two voices (as diverse strangers in foreign countries have
don heretofore) And I knowing that many of our nation have been very desirous
to have some published, not only such lovers of Music as do dwell in and nigh
unto the City of London, and the other cities and towns within this Realm
where convenient companies may sone be had to sing songs for more voices then
two, but also chiefly such as do dwell in the countries far from any of those
cities and towns, where such company can be had so soon to sing as aforesaid.
In consideration whereof I have now published in print these Duos or songs for
two voices to pleasure them and all others that be so affected. And now knowing
that your worship is a fauorer of Music, and has good judgment therein, I am
the more encouraged to present this work of mine unto you, I do confess that
the gift thereof is but small and simple, yet such as it is, it is rare in the
respect of the novelty thereof, and therefore I do the more willingly give it
unto you, as a token of a zealous affection, and dutiful love, that I do bear
unto you. And thus dedicating and yielding this same to your worships Patronage
and protection, I do commit you to the tuition of the Almighty, to whom I
daily pray to give you, and my very good lady your bedfellow, a long and
prosperous estate, with the like life, and at the end thereof, to bring and
receive you both into his place of eternal joy and all true blessedness.

By your worships during life to command Thomas Whythorne
From London the 19. of November. 1590.
