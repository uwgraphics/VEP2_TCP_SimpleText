A good Wife, or none,
To a pleasant new Tune.


^^e blazing Torch is soon burnt out,
the Diamonds light abides:
^he one ^^ glory shines about,
the other it is virtue hides:
that spark (if any) shall be mine,
that else gives light to none;
^or if t^ every one she shine,
I had rather lie alone.
^he Glowworm in the dark gives light,
unto the view of many;
^he Moon she shows her self by night,
and yields her self to any:
(...) if my love should seem to be,
of every one so known:
(...) never more should shine on me,
I had rather lie alone.
(...) no^ consume no^ pine away,
^o other lovers due;
^or such as wandering walk astray,
and never will prove true:
(...) (...) as light by any she,
as she by me has done:
(...) (...) love (...) constancy:
(...) else will lie alone.
A willow Garland for my head,
I never mean to wear;
I need no pillow for my bed,
I yet am void of care:
A single life, is without strife,
and freed from sigh and groan;
For such contentments of my life,
I Will choose to lie alone.
Once did I love the fairest Love,
that ever eye did see;
But she did most inconstant prove,
and set no love by me:
And ever since my mind is such.
to lend my love to none;
Because I have been crossed so much,
I Will ever lie alone.
The beauty of the fairest Flower,
so pleasing to the eye,
Does fade and wither in an hour,
and no man sets thereby:
So deals my fairest fair with me,
her joys in Love are gone;
Wherefore the wanton world shall see,
I Will choose to lie alone.
The second Part. To the same tune.


Well may we picture Cupid blind,
which roving shot his dart,
And made my lover most unkind,
to steal away my heart:
Which cannot be restord again,
it is so love sick grown;
For she has killed it with disdain,
therefore I Will lie alone.
Within that face I once did see
two diamond eyes, whose bright
And glistring beams so dazzled me,
that I was ravished quite,
And struck so blind, I could not see
the way that I had gone:
But from fond love I Am now set free,
and choose to lie alone.
This single life breeds golden ease,
no jealous thoughts offend;
Unwedded wights go where they please,
and fear no changing friend;
While married mates with musing mind,
do sob, and sigh, and groan,
Because their Turtles prove unkind:
therefore, I Will lie alone.
What if the Willow Garland be
appointed for my lot;
Yet this content shall comfort me,
false love is soon forgot:
A second Love may make amends,
now that the first is gone;
For Cresid kind had choice of friends,
else still had lien alone.
For if I could but cull my Choice,
out of Diana's train,
Who will not hear the tempters voice;
then might I love again:
And choose some yet more constant light,
then that which lately shone,
My equal fancy to requite:
or still I Will lie alone.
For time and opportunity,
will win the coyest Dame,
And overcome the chastest she,
that bears the bravest name:
Yea, Man was made for Woman's good,
not like the idle drone:
But for to heat and stir the blood;
and not to lie alone.
FINIS.
