The Kingis Maiesteis Proclamatioun beiring the very occasioun of the present
incu^ming of the Inglis forces, with his heines commandment for their good
Intreatment and freindly usage.
JAMES be the grace of God King of Scottis, To our Louittis William Bryson
Masar, Messingeris our Schireffis in that part coniunetly and severally
specially constitute greting. Forsamekle as it is not unknown to all the good
subiectis of this our Realm, quhat greit good will and freindschip our dearest
sister the Queen of Ingland (being Princess in the world neirest to us both
be blude and habitatioun) hes declarit not only towarris us and the
preseruatiou^ of our Innocent persoun ever sen our birth. Bot als quhat cair,
trauellis, and charges our said dearest sister hes takin, borne, and sustenit
for the saistie and preseruatioun of this our Realm in the auld ancient
liberty, far above the custom of any her predecessouris. For it is not to be
forgottin bot thankfully to be rememberit how euin with the beginning of her
Regne (were than standing betuix their two Realms) first of all a godly peace
was maid and concludit, quhilk to this time hes happily continewit to the
pleasure of God and greit commodity of this country. As alswa how schortlie
thairefter this our Realm being in danger of the French conqueist, and
Christian Religioun thairin likly to have been utterly suppressit, be our said
dearest sisteris forces and aid send to the assege of Leyth, the strangeris were
expellit and the stait of Religioun and liberty of the country preseruit, in
the quhilk actioun neither her treasure nor the blude and lyfis of her pepill
were spairit. The like cair weill appeirit in her quhen be her forces direct in
this our Realm in the Month of Maij, the eir of God ane thousand five
hundredth three scoir and ten eiris, the conspiratouris quhilkis pretendit our
depositioun from our Royal Crown and to erect ane other authority, were
profligat and disaponitit, and our Castle of Glass gow than assegit be them
succourit and releuit. Our said dearest sister never taking or occupying any
strenth, hald, or fute of ground in Scotland, bot that quhilk scho hes been
alwayis willing to rander to the awneris, upon na other conditiou^ saulffing
their returning to our obedience and surety for continewance thairat. And sen
that time it is weill knawin quhat trauellis and cair scho hes takin be her
Ambassadouris letteris and Messages to have our haill Realm quyetit to our
obedience. Quhairin her laubouris and mediatioun hes at Goddis pleasure takin
good success, our haill Realm in effect being reducit to the acknawledgeing
of our Authority, and in the place of the lang civil and intestine weir, good
peace restorit over all the country: our Castle of Edinburgh only exceptit.
Quhilk being put in the trust and custody of Williame Kirkcaldy sumtyme of
Grange Knight to our use and behufe be vmquhyle our dearest Cousing James Earl
of Murray our Regent for the time of worthy memory, the said Williame
unmindful of his trenth and promysit allevgeance, hes be the space of two
eiris with the mair now bypast be the meanis of the same Castle raisit and
contine wit the said civil and Intestine weir aganis our Royal estait and
Authority. To the disturbance of Christian Religioun, the Lawis, policy, and
haill commoun weill of our Realm, and rejecting the godly pacificatioun
quhilkis the chief Nobill men and vtheris returning to our obedience hes
ressauit, procedis in contempteous Rebellioun and weir, greitly annoying our
Burgh of Edinburgh being the chief sait of Justice, and doing besydis quhat in
him lyis to procure and draw strangeris in this our Realm for suppressing of
Religioun, our estait, and troubling the quyetnes of this haill I Will. And seeing
our principal Ordinance, Powder, Bullettis, and munitionnis ar detenit within
our said Castle, and vsit and spent aganis us and our good subiectis, our said
dearest sister hes been ernistly requyrit be our richt traist Cousing James
Earl of Mortoun Lord Dalkeith Regent to us our Realm and liegis, and Nobility
of this our Realm, for aid and succouris of men, ordinance, and munitioun, to
the expugnatioun, assege, and recovery of our said Castle. Quhilk scho hes
fauourabillie and liberally gra^tit, after all good meanis vsit to have brocht
the persounis being within our said Castle to our obedience be treaty. Bot
the same contempnit be them and reiectit, hes now preparit and causit put her
forces in full reddynes to enter in this our Realm, to be fully employed for
the mantenance and furthsetting of our Authority, in assegeing of our said
Castle, that the same being recouerit, may Immediately and indilaitlie be
delyuerit (with the ordinance, munitioun, Royal place, Iowellis, Wardrop, and
houshald stuf, and with the Registeris and recordis belanging to us and our
Crown) to us and our said Regent in our name and to our behufe. And swa thairby
peace restorit to our said Burgh of Edinburgh and our haill Realm in our
obedience, without any other pretense, meaning, or Intentioun in our said
dearest sister, or in Schir Williame Drurie Knicht, General of her saidis
forces. OUR will is heirfoir, and we charge ow straightly and commandis, that
Incontinent their our letteris seen e pas and in our Name and Authority make
publicatioun heirof at the market Croce of our Burgh of Edinburgh, and all
other places neidfull, that nane pretend Ignorance of the same, or sinisterlie
deprave and misreport of our said dearest sisteris freindly and fauourabill
Intentioun. And that e command and charge all and sindrie our liegis, that they
and every ane of them thankfully ressaue the General of her forces, and
haill persounis being under his charge, and to schaw and gif to them all
favor and good intreatment in ludgeing, meit, drink, and vtheris their
necessaris upon their ressonabill charges, vnrasand the present prices in any
thing. And that nane tak upon hand to do to them or any of them harm, grief,
Injury, or vncurtesie in bodyis or gudis be word, deid, or countenance, under
the pane of deid. Certifying them that faileis, they salbe repute and estemit
as seditious and wickit Instrumentis, hinderaris of our service and obedience,
fauouraris and pertakaris with the declarit Tratour is and Rebellis being
within our said Castle, and the pane of deid salbe execute upon them with all
Rigor in exempill of vtheris. The quhilk to do we commit to ow coniunetlie and
severally our full power, be their our letteris delyuering them be ow dewlie
execute and Indorsat agane to the berare.

Regne the sext eir. 1573. Per Actum Secreti Consilij. CVM PRIVILEGIO REGIS.
