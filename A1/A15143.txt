To the worshipful and right virtuous young Gentylman, GEORGE MAINVVARING
Esquier: IS. VV. wissheth happy health with good succsesse in all his godly
affairs.
WHen I (good M. MAINVVARING) had made this simple Nosegaye: I was in mind to
bestow the same on some dear frind, of which number I have good occasion to
account you chief: But waying with my self, that although the Flowers bound
in the same were good: yet so little of my labor was in them that they were
not (^^^^^ be they should) to be (...)for the least of a great number of
benefits, which have from time to time (even from our Childhoo^) received of
you: yet ^^^^^ by me, you^^^^^^ be occasioned to say, as ANTI^ATER s^^^^DEMADES
of Athens, that (...)him with geueing, I would ^o ^^^^^^y self ^^^ffied,
gratifye your Gifts, and also by the (...) confessions that by deeds you have
deserved benefits: which as DIOGENES says) is ^^^^ worth then be ^eu^^^ or
(...) by receiving of many (...) benefits (Which to do is not allotted me) to
accquit your courtesies, I come to prefer you^pore (...) which having no goods,
ca^^ with his hands full of water to meet the Persian Prince withal, who
respecting the good will of the man^ did not disdain his simple Gift: even
so, I being ^^^^^^ to bestow some Present on you, by the same thinking to make
part of a^onder for the (...)merited, to perform the duty of a friend,
(...)express the good will that should rest in Country folk, and not having
of mine own to discharge that I go about (like to that poor Fellow which ^^^^
into an others ground for his water) did shaping another garden for these
Flowers: which I (...) you (as DARIUS did,) to accept: and though they be of
another growing, yet considering they be of my own gathering and making
^^^^spect my labor and regard my good will and (...) them, but vouch^^^^ to be
a protected(...) him from the spightful, which (perhaps) will(...)hat leith as
presented you, or gathered th(...)ad done one, or both: and so might spoyle^^^^
Nosegay, and not to let it come so happili (...) hands, as I wish it may. And
though the Garden of your godly mind be full fraught with (...) Flowers, which
I know in your infancy to take root, and which all may see now to flourish,
with an undoubted hope of their yielding fruit hereafter: yet ordain to smell
so these, and when you come into a pestilent air that might infect your sound
mind: yet savor to these SLIPS in which I trust you shall find safety: And if
you take pleasure in them, I shall not only be occasioned to endeavor my self
to make a further viage for a more dayntier thing (then Flowers are) to present
you withal: but also have good hope that you will accept this my labor, for
recompense of all that which you are unrecompensed for, as knows god: who I
beseech give unto you a long and a lucky life with increase of all your
virtuous studies.

From Abchurch Lane, the 20 of October, 1573. By your well willing Countriwoman.
IS. VV.

The Auctor to the Reader.
THis Haruesttyme, I Haruestlesse,
and servicelesse also:
And subject unto sickness, that
abroad I could not go.
Had leisure good, (though learning lackt)
some study to apply:
To read such Books, whereby I thought
myself to edyfye.
Sometime the Scriptures I perusd;
but wantyng a Divine:
For to resolve me in such doubts;
as past this head of mine
To understand: I laid them by
and Histories began read:
Wherein I found that follyes erst,
in people did exceed
The which I see does not decrease,
in this our present time
More pity it is we follow them,
in every wicked crime.
I straight waxt weary (...)es,
and many other mo^^
As VIRGILL, OVID^^^ANTVAN,
which many wonders ^^^e.
And to refresh my masede^^^^^
and cheer my (...)
And for to try if that my limbs.
had got their strength again
I walked out: but suddenly
a friend of mine me met:
And said, if you regard your health:
out of this Lane you get
And shift you to some better air.
for fear to be infect:
With noisome smell and savors ill,
I wysh on that respect.
And have regard unto your health,
or else perhaps you may:
So make a dye, and then adieu,
your woeful friends may say,
I thankt him for his carefulnes,
and this for answer gave:
I Will neither shun, nor seek for death,
yet often the same I crave,
By reason at my lucklesse life,
believe me this is true:
In that (says he) you do a miss,
than had he me adieu.
For he was hastyng out of Town,
and could no longer bide:
And I went home, all sole alone,
good Fortune was my guide.
And though sh^^^^er has denyde,
to hoyce m^^ on her Wheel:
Yet now she stood me in some steed,
and made me pleasures feel.
For she so Plat his Plot me brought,
where fragrant Flowers abound:
The smell whereof preuents each harms,
if yet your self be sound,
Amongst those Beds so bravely decked,
with every goodly Flower:
And Banks and Borders finely framde,
I me reposde one hour.
And longer would, but leisure lackt,
and business had me hye:
And come again some other time,
to fill my gasing eye.
Though loath: yet at the last I went,
but ere I parted thence:
A slip I took to smell unto,
which might be my defense,
In stynking streets, or loathsome Lanes
which else might me infect:
And sense that time, I each day once
have viewd that brave prospect.
And though the Master of the same,
I yet did never see:
It seems he is a Gentylman,
and full of courteisye:
For none that with good zeal does come,
do any one resist:
And such as will with or^^^^ get,
may gather whilst they ^^^t.
Then pytite were it to destroy,
what he with pain did plant
The moderate here may be suffizde
and he no whit shall want.
And for my part, I may be bold,
to come when as I will:
Yea, and to choose of all his Flowers,
which may my fancy fill.
And now I have a Nosegay got,
that would be passing rare:
If that to sort the same aright,
wear lotted to my share,
But in a bundle as they he,
(good Reader them accept:
It is the geuer: not the gift,
thou ought to respect,
And for thy health, not for thy eye,
did I this Posye frame:
Because my self did safety find,
by smelling to the same,
But as we are not all alyke,
nor of complexion one:
So that which helps some we see.
to others good does none,
I do not say, it did me help,
I no infection felt:
But sure I think they kept me free,
because to them I smelt.
And for because I like them well,
and good have found thereby:
I for good will, do gave them thee,
first taste and after try.
But if thy mind infected be,
then these will not prevail:
Sit Medicus with stronger Earbes,
thy maliadye must quayle
For these be but to keep thee sound,
which if thou use them well:
(Pains of my life) in healthy state
thy mind shall ever dwell;
Or if that thy complexion,
with them do not agree:
Refer them to some friend of thine,
till thou their virtue see.
And this I pray the, whether thou,
infected wast before:
Or whether with thy nature strong;
they can agree no more,
That thou my Nosegay not misuse,
but leave it to the rest:
A number may such pleasure find,
to bear it in their breast.
And if thy self would gather more,
then I have herein bound:
My counsel is that thou repair,
to Master Plat his ground,
And gather there what I did not,
perhaps thy self may light:
On those which for thee fitter are,
then them which I resighte.
Which if thou do, then render thanks,
to him which sowed the soil,
If not, thou needs must him commend,
when as thou viewest his toils
In any wise, be chary that
thou let in no Swine:
No Dog to scrape, nor beast that does
to rauin still inclyne,
For though he make no spare of them,
to such as have good skyll:
To slip, to shere, or get in time,
and not his branches kill:
Yet bars he out, such greedy guts,
as come with spite to toote:
And without skill, both Earb and Flower
pluck rashly by the root.
So wishing thee, to find such Flowers,
as may thee comfort bring:
And eke that he which framd the Plot,
with virtues still may spring.
I thee commend to mighty JOVE,
and thus I thee assure:
My Nosegay will increase no pain,
though sickness none it cure,
Wherefore, if thou it hap to wear
and feel thy self much worse:
Promote me for no Sorceresse,
nor do me ban or curse.
For this I say the Flowers are good,
which I on thee bestow:
As those which wear them to the stalks,
Shall by the sequel know.
One word, and then adieu to thee,
if thou to Plat his Plot
Repair: take heed it is a Maze
to warn thee I forgot.
*FINIS. quod IS. VV.

T.B. in commendation of the Author.
MArching among the woods of fine delighte
Where as the Laurel branch does bring increase
Seelde, of Ladies fresh, a solemn sight:
I viewd, whose walks betokened all their ease:
And bow in friendly wise, it did them please:
VVhiles some did twist the Silk of lively hew
Some others slipped the Brannch for preyses dew.
*Nor musing did not rest, nor scorn my sight,
nor pressed in haste to break their silence I
But as at first, they held their whole delight:
and casting mirth, said Friend that passest bye
did never wrethes of love that bind perdy:
As thus: who framde her Plot in G^
So orderly, as best she might devise.
Not yet (quoth I,) but you might forte the same
whose face does stain the color red as Rose:
No VIRGILL this, nor OVID eke may blam,
For Beauty pressing as the Cunduit floes,
was cause that PARIS greatess love arose:
who loved before, though never touched so,
As OVID shows, with many writers more.
*But Ladies sure, my love consistes in this
my whole delight, and pleasure all I take
To deck the wight, that worthy praises is:
and sure my great goodwyll must never slake
From VVHITNEY: lo, herein some party take
For in her work is plainly to be seen,
Why Ladies place in Garlands Laurel green.
*She flattering Fate too much, nor skies does trust:
such labor lies finished with the life:
She never did account Dame Fortune just,
that tosseth us with toys and plunges rife:
But her defieth, as Auctor of her strife:
She does not write the brute or force in Arms,
Nor pleasure takes, to sing of others harms,
*But mustred has and wrapped in a pack
a heap of Flowers of Philosophy:
No branch of perfect wisdom here does lack
But that the bruised mind, refresht may be,
And that it is no fable, you shall see:
For here at large the sequel will declare
To Country Dearde, her love and friendly care.
*The smelling Flowers of an Arbor sweet,
An Orcharde picked presented is to thee:
And for her second work, she thought it meet,
sith Maids with lofty style may not agree:
In hoape hereby, somthynge to pleasure thee,
And when her busy care from head shall lurk,
She practice will, and promise longer work.
*Now happy Dames, if good deserves well,
her praise for Flowers philosophical:
And let your Branches twyned that excel
her head adorn: wherein she floorish shall:
And BERRIE so, restes always at your call,
The purple blew, the red, the white I have,
To wrappe amyd your Garlands fresh and brave.

Flowers. etc.
The I. Flower.
SUch friends as have been absent
more joyful be at meeting

When peryls they are present, then
does absence keep thee free:
Whereas, if that thou present werte

The III.
The presence of the mind must be
preferred, if we do well:
Above the bodies presence; for
it far does it excel.
The IIII.
Yet abse^ce, sbtimes brings harm,
when friends but fickle are:
For new acquaintance purchase place
and old do lose their share.
The V.

These contraries, that absent friends
much toy at meeting find.

And true it proves, by those whose winds
Oblivion has possess.
The IX.
Care not how mant things thou have
but have a great regard:
That they be good, for quantytie,
both merit no reward.
*The X.
Yet so thou must increase thy stock
as clear thine own it be:
And neither fleece thy friend, nor seek
thy neighbors beggerye.
The XI
We easily may abuse the great
and chiefest thing of all:
But hard it is to use and right,
such as are trifles small.
*The 12.
Our rares we must not ever oye,
to each man's accusation:
Nor without tryail, trust too much,
to any ones perswation.
*The 13.
I fault right greater seems far,
on the accusers part:
Then it on the Defendants does
much more should be his smart.
The 14.
Thy friends admonysh secretly,
of crimes to which they swerve:
But praise them openly, if so be,

Those precepts which in youthful years
are printed in thy breast:
Will deepest diue, and do more good
then ever shall the rest.
The 18.
You must not suffer youth to raing
nor stray abroad at will:
For liberty both lewdness breed,
wherefore prevent that ill.
The 19.
The bigor of our youth, no whit
does differ from the flower:
Which for a time does flourish sayre,
and qutekly lose his power.

thine Age approaches fast:
And follow thou the steps of such,

The 21.
In youth to thee such learning get
as it may make thee wise:
So people shall in elder years,
come seek thy sage advise.
*The 22.
The inclinations of our youth,
desires that thence does spring:
Fore show what fruict in future time
our ripened age will bring.
The 23.
No hope of goodness can be had
of him, who spends his prime,
In living so lycentious,
that he respects no crime.
The 24.
That mind which sensual appetites
in youth does blyndly guyd:
To Age do bodies yield deformde,
because they wandered wide.
*The 25
Now vain it is for crooked Age
his youth for to require:
So is it for youth that childish years
would willingly desire.
The 26.
Old people deem them nearer death
then those that youthful seem
But youth seproaner to his end,
and less does life esteem,
The 27.
Great cruelty it is for us
to use a churlysh check
To any, when adversity,
has brought them to a wreck,
The 28.
None in adversity has help,
except they prospered have
And by yt menes have purchased friends
of whom they aid may crave.
The 29.
If misery thou would not know,
live dangerlesse thou must
Or else to taste of troubles great

and husband does decay.
The 35.
Men do by emulation,
of others, prove the same
In every ill as custom is,

The 36.
Those strokes which mates in mirth do give
do seem to be but light:
Although sometime, they leave a sign
seems grievous to the sight.
*The 37.
All men thou shall thine equal make
if thou such playnesse use
As thou not fear, nor yet art feared,
nor art, nor do abuse.
The 38.
Whylst hairs are hidden wastely
Age does himself be wray:
For will we, nyl we, h'eele appear,
when youth is chaste away.
The 39.
Children are lykened to the spring
and Stripplings to the Summer.
And yongme^, they ar Autumpne like
and old men weary winter.
The 40.
Have thou access always to such
let such resort to thee:
Is temper all their talk with truth,
and are from envy free.
The 41.
When Brethren be at varience,
how should the enemies gree;
When friends fall out among themselves
who shall their dais member.
*The 42.
A friendly mind, accoumpt it for
the nearest of thy kyn:
When al shall fail, it sticks to thee,
what ever chance has been.

Affection is of force so strong,

He deemeth to be like himself,
and does no worse surmise.
The. 44.
Let thine affections ruled be,
least that they do thee rule:
For then no strength will thee avail
nor back can thou recule.
*The. 45.
The sorrowful do think it death,
to linger in this life:
And wish to be desolu'd thereof,
thereby to stint their strife.

What sere it be that doubtful is,
grauntes health th'aflicted till:
He utterly denies that he,
to health restore him will.
*The. 47.
The plowman is accounted small
his reputation none:
Yet of the membbers in a Realm
of chiefest he is one:
*The. 48.
At diceplaying, he that excelles
and counningstly can play:
In my conceat, for wickedness,
may bear the price a way;
*The. 49.
Brease not too hie, but have regard
if thou would chance to fall:
From hie might kyl, from mean might hurt
allow stand sure thou shall.
*The.50.
The man that is ambicious,
does lose such honor often:
Is he has got, when fortune pleased.

The. 51.
When Potentats ambicious are,

When Realms denide within themselves
no cities are vnsackt.

Walks in a world of wilderness,
full fraught with dangers deep.

The falt which in thy friend, you seemst
to suffer, or permit:
Thou gilty art, thereof thy self,

So often as faithful friends depart
so often to dye they seem:
To separate, the grief is great,
but absence is extreme.
*The 56.
Account so ever of thy friend,
as he thy foe may frame
So bear thee, that in enmytie,

*The 57.
To all men use thou equytye,
show faith unto thy friend
In every thing that thou pretendst,
do still respect the end.
*The 58.
By benefits unto thy friend,
show thine abilytie:
And that thy foes may know ye same
thine Iniuryes let fly.
The 59.
Al things with friends in common are
at least it should be so
That pleasures might imparted be
so like wise grief, or woe.
*The 60.
The poor, they have no friends at al
for to participate,
The sorrow and the grief they find
in their most wretched state.
*The 61.
In loving, each one has free choice,
or ever they begin,
But in their power it lies not,
to end when they are in.
The 62.
The angry lover flattereth
himself with many lies:
And fondly feeds on such toys
as fancy does devise.
The 63.
Each lover knows what he lykes
and what he does desire,
But seld, or never does he know,
what thing he should require.
*The. 64.
In time, may love, by percemeale wear
and wither clean a way:
But presently to pluck his roots,
in vain you do assay.
*The. 65.
The lovers teres, will soon appease
his Ladies angry mood:
But men will not be pacified,
if Memen weep a flood.
*The. 66.
As Poets feign, ye Gods themselves
in love could use no myt:
Then mortal men may be allowde,
such follyes to commit.
The 67.
The yongmen when they are in love
may profit gain thereby:
But in the oulde, it is a fault
for they should love defye.
The 68.
If love have given thee a blow,
and that thou art unsound,
Make means that you a plaster have,
of them which gave the wound,
The 69.
When secret love once kindled is,
twill burn with fiercest flame:
The surest way to be beloved,
is fyest to do the same.
The. 70.
The lover whith does look aloft,
and does submission hate:
Shall have a slip, or answered be,
that he is come to late.
The. 71.
Whos'ere they be, the laws of love
has guided for a season:
It is a doubt, that never more.
they will be ruld by reason.
*The 72.
The cough it is so cumbersome,
that none the same can hide:
So love full fraught with foolish toies
may easily be efpyde.
*The 73.
The foremost step to wisdom is,
from love to keep thee free:
The second for to love so close,
that none the same may see.
The 74.
An old man when he is in love;
of him this may we deem:
Of all hard haps and chances fell,
he has the most extreme.
The. 75.
The love of wicked persons must,
be got by wicked means:
Make thine account, when you have done
and give the devil yt gains.
The. 76.
Affection and deceaues the wise
and love make men such noddyes
That to their selves they seem as dead
yet live in other boddies,
The. 77.
A virtuous man, yt has the fear
of God: before his eyes:
Is sure in safety for to walk,
for all his enemies.
*The. 78.
No credit give, or not to much,
to that which thou do hear,
If that out of a troubled mind
thou spyest it to appear.
The. 79.
The bow that ever stands bent
too far will never cast
The mind which evermore is flack,
does badly prove at last.
The. 80.
Such minds, as are disposed well
brings wanderers to the way:
And ready are with helping hand,
to such as go astray.
The. 81.
Of worldly things, the chiefest is
a well contented mind:
That does despise for to aspyre,
nor gapeth gifts to find.
*The. 82.
If thou do ill, it forces not
what mind thoh we west thereto,
Because thy mind cannot be seen,
But that which thou do do.
The. 83.
A loathsome sight, God knows it is
a fickle mind to see:
It wuld be pure for to reject,
that bile impuritie.
*The. 84.
Our years and days wax worse and worse and worse
more grievous is our sorrow:
He that's unfit tomend to day,
will worser be tomorow.
*The. 85.
The present day we cannot spend
as we the same should do
Except to count it as our last,
we frame our selves unto.
*The. 86.
As ours do please some other men,
so theirs do us delight:
Which shows our yt contented mind
that often works us spite.
The. 87.
He that with his own weapon is
dispatched of his life:
Twice slain he is because himself
was kyld with his own knyfe.
The. 88.
*Those promises which are forgot,
be not for aye neglect
They may performed be at last,
and have their full effort:
The. 89.
A miserable grief it is,
by him to have a harm
On who^ we dare not once complain
nor can our selves him charm.
The. 90.
Their sight is weak yt waxes dim
to see another blind
And very little comfort shall,
the afflicted by them find.
The. 91.
A pleasure ill, and profyt none
it is, delight to make,
In the use of any neighbors goods
for which they pains did take.
The. 92.
He is not much deceived, whose suit
full quickly has denial
Nor can he say, that he had cause,
to linger for the trial.
The. 93.
Full hard it is, and hazard great
to keep for any white:
A thing that each one lusreth for
for some will thee beguile.
*The. 94.
Do not account yt for thine own,
which may from thee be take:
But much exteeme such tresure, as
will never thee forsake.
*The. 95.
The day does dally so with us,
that we can never know:
For what to wish, from what to fly
what works us weal or woe.
*The. 96.
He does not soon to royne come
that fears it ere it fall:
But may provide it to prevent,
if Fortune grant he shall.
The. 97.
Ask nothing of thy neighbor, that
thou woldst not let him have:
Nor say him nay, of yt which thou
woldst get, if thou did crave.
The. 98.
If that thou minded are to give
ask not if they will have it
For so, they either must deny
or seem that they do crave it.
*The. 99.
It glorious is, to give all things
to him that naught does crave:
Do likewise let him nothing get
that euerything would have.
*The. 100.
Whilst that thou have fre liberty
to do what lykes thee best:
Thou soon may se into thy self
what disposytion rest.
*The. 1001.
That Lawyer, which is chose to plead
for rich and mighty men:
Must either let the truth go by,
or lose their friendship then.
The. 1002.
A little gould in law will make,
thy matter better speed:
Then if thou broughtest of love as much
as might in kindreds breed.
The. 1003.
Gold savors well though it be got
with occupations vile:
Of thou have gold, thou welco^e art,
though virtue thou exyle.
The. 1004.
Such poor folk as to law do got,
are driven often to curse:
But in mean while, the Lawyer thrusts
the money in his purse.
*The 1005.
A hasty tongue, which runs at large
not knowing any measure,
It is a wicked thing that makes
the mind repent at leisure.
The. 1006.
Two eyes, two ears, and but one tongue
Dame nature has us framed
That we might se, and hear much more
the^ should we to^g be named.
The. 1007.
Repewel thy tongue, and keep thy frind
ill used, it causes foes
In vetryng things, commit to thee
thou faithful friends nor do lose.
The. 1008.
Seek not each man to plese, for that
is more then God ^^^s do:
Please thou the best and never care,
what wicked say thereto.
The. 1009.
Of wicked men to be dispraysd,
for praise do it account:
If they commend, then art you mad
so does their credit mount.
*The. 10010.
When as the wicked are in midst
of all their iolitye:
Misfortune stands at the door,
and skornes the same to see.

And use it first and last: and is
Will safely thee preserve.

GOOd Reader now you tasted have,
and smelt of all my flowers:
The which to get some pain I took,
and trauayled many hours.
I must request you spoil them not,
nor do in peers teareth them:
But if thy self do loathe the sent.
gene others leave to wear them.
I shall no whit be discontent,
for nothing is so pure:
But one, or other will mislyke
thereof we may be sure.
If he for whom I gathered them,
take pleasure in the same:
And that for my presumption,
my Friends do not me blame.
And that the savor take effect,
in such as I do know:
And bring no harm to any else,
in place where it shall go.
And that when I am distant far,
it worns before my sake:
That some may say, God speed her well
that did this Nosegay make
And eke that he who ought the Plot,
wherein they same did grow:
Fume not to see them borhe about,
and wysh he did me know.
And say in rage were she a man,
that with my flowers does brag,
She well should pay the price, I would
not leave her worth a rag,
If as I say, no harms do hap,
but that this well may speed:
My mind is fully satisfied,
I crave uone other meede.
So wishing thee no worse then those,
of whom I think none ill:
I make an end and thee commend,
the liueiug Lord until.
FINIS. IS. VV.

Certain familier Epistles and friendly Letters by the Auctor: with Replies.
To her Brother. G. VV.
GOod Brother when a vaca^t time
does cause you hence to ride:
And that the fertyl feelds do make,
you from the City vyde.
Then cannot I once from you hear
nor know I how to send:
Or where to harken of your health
and all this would be hend.
And most of me, for why I least,
of Fortunes favor find:
Do yeldyng year we me allows,
nor goods has me assind.
But still to friends I must appeal
(and next our Parents dear,)
You are, and must be chiefest slaffe
that I shall stay on hear.
Wherefore mine own good brother grant
me when yt you ar here:
To se you often and also hence,
I may have knowledge wheare
A messenger to hark unto,
that I to you may write:
And eke of him your answers have
which would my heart delight.
Receive of me, and eke accept,
a simple token hear:
A smell of such a Nosegay as
I do for present bear.
Unto a virtuous Lady, which
till death I honor will:
The loss I had of service hers,
I languish for it still.
Your loving (though lucklesse) Sister, IS. VV.

To her Brother. B. VV.
GOod Brother Brook, I often look,
to hear of your return:
But none can tell, if you be well,
nor where you do soiurne:
Which makes me fear, that I shall hear
your health appaired is:
And often I dread, that you are dead,
or somthyng goes amys.
Yet when I think, you can not shrink,
but must with Master he:
I have good hope, when you have scope,
you will repair to me.
And so the fear, and deep despair,
that I of you then had
I drive away: and wysh that day
wherein we may be glad.
Glad for to see, but else for me:
will be no joy at all:
For on my side, no luck will bide,
nor happy chance befall.
As you shall know, for I will show,
you more when we do speak,
Then will I wryt, or yet resyte,
within this Paper weak.
And so I end, and you commend,
to him that guides the skies:
Who grant you health, and send you wealth,
no less then shall suffice.
*Your loving Sister. Is. VV.

An order prescribed, by IS. VV. to two of her younger Sisters seruinge in
London.
GOOd Sisters mine, when I
shall further from you dwell:
Beruse theselines, observe the rules
which in the same I tell.
So shall you wealth posses,
and quietness of mind:
And al your friends to se the same,
a treble joy shall find.
1.
In mornings when you rise,
forget not to commend:
Your selves to God, beseching him
from dangers to defend.
Your souls and boddies both,
your Parents and your friends:
Your teachers and your gouerners
so pray you that your ends,
May be in such a sort,
as God may pleased he:
To live to dye, to dye to live,
with him eternally.
2.
Then tustly do such deeds,
as are to you assynde:
Ill wanton toys, good sisters now
exile out of your mind,
I hope you give no cause,
whereby I should suspect:
But this I know too many live,
that would you soon infect.
If God do not prevent,
or with his grace expel:
I cannot speak, or write to much,
because I love you well.
3.
Your busfnes soon dispatch,
and listen to no lies:
Nor credit every feigned tale,
that many will devise.
For words they are but wind.
yet words may hurt you so:
As you shall never brook the same,
if that you have a foe.
God shyld you from all such,
as would by word or Byll.
Procure your shame, or never cease
till they have wrought you ill.
4.
See that your seere is seal,
tread trifles under ground:
If to rehersall often you come,
it will your quiet wound.
Of laughter be not much,
nor over solemn see me:
For then be sure th'eyle coumpt you light
or proud will you exteeme.
Be modest in a mean,
be gentle unto all:
Though cause thet give of contrari
yet be to wrath no thrall.
Refer you all to him.
that sits above toe skies:
Uengeance is his, he will reveng,
you need it not devise.
5.
And since that virtue guides,
where both of you do dwell:
Give thanks to God, and painful he
to please your rulers well,
For fleetyng is a foe,
expertence has me taught:
The rolling stone does get no moss
your selves have hard full often.
Your business being done,
and this my scroule pervsd,
The day will end, and that yt night
by you be not abusde.
I some thing needs must write,
take pains to read the same:
Henceforth my life as well as Pen
shall your examples frame.
6.
Your Masters gone to Bed,
your Mistress at rest.
Their Daughters all whast about
to get themselves undressed.
See that their Plate be safe,
and that no Spoone do lack,
See Doors and windows bolted fall
for fear of any wrack.
Then help if need there he,
to do some household thing:
If not to bed, referring you,
unto the heavenly King
Forgettyng not to pray
as I before you taught,
And geueing thanks for all that he,
has ever for you wrought.
Good Sisters when you pray,
let me remembered be:
So will I you, and thus I cease,
till I your selves do see.
( q) IS. VV.

To her Sister Misteris A. B.
BEcause I to my Brethern wrote,
and to my Sisters two:
Good Sister Anne, you this might wot,
if so I should not do
To you, or ere I parted hence,
You vainly had bestowed expense.
Yet is it not for that I write,
for nature did you bind:
To do me good: and to requight,
has nature me inclynde:
Wherefore good Sister take in gree,
These simple lines that come from me.
Wherein I wish you Nestors days,
in happy health to rest:
With such success in all assayes,
as those which God has blessed:
Your Husband with your pretty Boys,
God keep them free from all annoyes.
And grant if that my luck it he,
to linger here so long:
Til they be men: that I may see,
for learning them so strong:
That they may march amongst the best,
Of them which learning have possessed.
By that time will my aged years
perhaps a staff require:
And quakyngly as still in fears,
my lims draw to the fire:
Yetioy I shall them so to see,
If any toy in age there he,
Good sister so I you commend,
to him that made us all:
I know you huswyfery intend,
though I to writting fall:
Wherefore no longer shall you stay,
From business, that profit may.
*Had I a Husband, or a house,
and all that longes thereto
My self could frame about to rouse,
as other women do:
But til some household cares me tie,
My books and Pen I will apply.
*Your loving Sister. IS. VV.

To her Cosen. F. VV.
GOOd Cousin mine, I hope in health
and safety you abide.
And sore I long, to here if yet
you are to wedlock tide.
If so you be, God grant that well
both you and she it spend:
If not when s'ere it haps, I wish
that God much joy you send.
And when you to the Cuntry come
or thither chance to send:
Let me you see, or have some scroll,
that shall of you be pend.
And this account as nature binds
and meryts yours deserve:
I Cousin am, and faithful Friend,
not minding once to swerue.
So wishing you as happy health,
as ever man possessed:
I end, and you commyt to him
that evermore is blessed.
Your poor Kinsewoman. IS. VV.

A careful complaynt by the unfortunate Auctor.
GOOd DIDO stint thy tears,
and sorrows all resign
To me: that borne was to augment,
misfortunes lucklesse line.
Or using still the same,
good DIDO do thy best:
In helpyng to bewail the hap,
that furthereth mine unrest.
For though thy Troyan mate,
that Lord AENEAS hight,
Requityng ill thy stetfast love,
from Carthage took his flight.
And fowly brake his oath,
and promise made before:
Whose falshode finished thy delight,
before thy hairs were hoar.
Yet greater cause of grief
compells me to complain:
For Fortune fell converted has,
My health to heaps of pain.
And that she swears my death,
to plain it is (alas)
Whose end let malice still attempt,
to bring the same to pass.
O DIDO thou had liu'de,
a happy Woman still,
If fickle fancy had not thrald
thy wits: to retchlesse will.
For as the man by whom,
thy deadly dolors bred:
Without regard of plighted troth,
from CARTHAGE City fled.
So might thy cares in time,
be banished out of thought:
His absence might well salve the sore,
that erst his presence wrought.
For fire no longer burns,
then Faggots feed the flame:
The want of things that breed annoy,
may soon redress the same.
But I unhappy moss,
and gript with endless griefs:
Despair (alas) amid my hope,
and hope without relief.
And as the sweltyng heat,
consumes the War away:
So do the heaps of deadly harms,
still threaten my decay.
O Death delay not long,
thy duty to declare:
Ye Sisters three dispatch my days
and finysh all my care.
( q) IS. VV.

In answer to comfort her, by showing his haps to be harder.
FRiend IS. be now content, and let my sorrows quel:
the extreme rage, and care thou restest in:
For wayling sprights, ne furies fearce in hell:
nor gristey souls, that still in woe have bin:
Have ever felt like storms that I sustain,
frowust so I am, and duld in deep despair,
That sure (me thinks), my extreme raging pain:
might gain thee belth: and set thee free from fere.
For DIDO, thou, and many thousands more,
which living feel the panges of extreme care,
Though tortered much; and torn in pieces small:
whom ever griping death does never spare,
Nor he, that falsey, Carthage City fled,
so fraught with wiles, n or ye such sorrows taste:
By thousand parts, as I who rightly sed:
do pine as WAX, before the fire wastes.
I freece to ICE, I be ate with perching SON,
and torn with teene, thus languishing in pain,
Do feel my sorrows ever fresher run:
to flowing cares, that endless sorrows gain.
For what, for whom, and why this evil woorks
frind IS. VV, time, nor silence; may it show
But she ere many days, my care that lurks,
shall blown be, and thou the same shall know.
Till then, with silly DIDO be content,
and rip no more, thy wrongs in such excess:
Thy FORTUNE rather, wills thee so lament,
with speedy wit, til hope may have redress.
*FINIS. ( q) T. B.

A Replye to the same.
THe bitter force of Fortunes frowardness,
is painted out by Bible changed hew:
Report bewrayes, that tirants doubleness,
which I by trial, prove (alas) so true.
constraynde I am, on thy mishaps to rue:
As often as I consider thine estate.
Which differs far, from that you wast of late.
Where be thy wonted lively looks become;
or what mischa^ce, has dimd the beauty so
There is no God yt deals such doutful dom
No Iubiter has brought the down so low:
thy haples fate, has stroght thy ouerthro
For as Saturnus reaues the Berryes soy,
So Fortune strives, to further thine annoy.
O Fortune falce, O thrice vnttedy joys
Why does not man mistrust thy sutle shoes
Whose profers prove in time to be but toies
as this the fruit yt from your blossom groes
then may you rightly be co^yard with those
whose painted speech, professes frindship still
but time be wrayes the meaning to be yli.
For time yt shows, what erst I could not see
Has brought about, that I suspected least:
Complaining still on our simplicitlye
Who hedlong runs, as does ye carles beast
til hu^ters snares, have laid his lims to rest
For when we lest mistrust and dread deceit
Then ar we snard, with unsuspected baif.
As lately unto thee it did be fall,
whose hap enforeeth me to rue thy chance
For thou that florisht erst at beautyes stal:
Has felt ye force of froward Fortunes lance
Compeld to furnish out misfortunes dance
See here the suertie that belongs aye,
To mortal ioys whereon the world does stay
But live in hope that better hap may light,
For after storms Sir Phoebus force is seen
So when Saturnus has declarde his might:
And VVinter stints to turn ye world to teene
then plesa^t Ver shall cloth ye ground in green
And lusty MAY shall labor to restore,
the things ye VVinters spit had spoyld before
The^ shall the Berrey cleave ber wonted hew.
And eke my B. that long has rasted pain
When Fortun does her former grace renew
shall boysed be to happy state again
Delightyng often among his friends and kin,
To tell what danger erst his life was in.
Which happy light of mortal creturs, who
shall more rejoice, then I thy friend to see
And while came fortune, yielded not thereto
but does proleed: to prove her suite on thee
yet shall thou not so ill beloved he,
But that thy Fame, for ever flourish shall,
If IS. her Pen, may promise ought at all.
Farewell.
IS. VV. to C.B. in bewailing her mishappes.
IF beauie hearts might serve to be
a sacrifice for sin:
Orels, if sorrows might suffice,
for what so ere has been:
Then mine Oblacion, is wear made,
Which long have lived in Mourners trade,
*The dryrie day in dole (alas)
continuallye I spend:
The noisome nights, in restless Bed,
I bring unto his end:
And when the day appears again,
Then fresh begin my plaints amayne.
But this I fear, will sooner cease:
the number of my sin:
Then make amends, for former miss,
that I have lived in:
Because I take not patiently
Correction in aduersytie.
*Wherefore (my God) give me that gift,
As bedyd I OB until:
That I may take with quietness,
What soever is his will:
Then shall my lucklesse life soon end,
Or froward Fortune shall amend.
*And for because your sound advice,
may ease me in distress:
For that two wits may compass more
then one, you must confess:
And that, that burden does not dear,
Which friend will sometime help to bear.
*Therefore, in this perplexity,
To you dear friend I write:
You know mine endless misery,
you know, how some me spite:
With counsel cure, for fear of wrack,
And help to bear, that breaks my back:
*So wishing you in health to hide,
and troubleshot to taste
And giving tendance for your aid,
which I requier in haste
I cease: and humbly me commend,
To the conducting of my Friend,
*YOur unfortunate Friend. IS. VV.

In answer by C. B. to IS. VV.
YOur lamentable letterred,
and finding by the same:
That you my skillesse counsel crave,
to bring you to some frame:
Such as it is, I ready priest,
Both am, and will, to do my best.
And where as thou in sorrow soust
do pyne thy self away:
I with thee for to conquer care,
least the bring thy decay:
Those fretting fyts, that thou art in,
Offends the Lord, augmenteth sin.
The heavy heart: and mind oppressed,
be never both reiea:
And at what hour we lament,
be does be still respect.
Yet that for sin thou shuldst thee kill,
Would has thy soul and body spyll.
*But it is not altogether sin,
that makes you sorrow this:
It is because that Fortune she,
does frown on you iwis:
Wherefore if you my counsel like,
Turn of your tears, and cease to like.
Impart thy woes, and give to niee,
the greatest of the same:
Pluck strength thee to: and cherish thee,
to modest mirth now frame:
Then friends and you may work so well,
That Fortune shall your foes expel.
If evil words and other wants,
have brought thee to this woe:
Remember how that Christ him self,
on earth was even so:
Thy Friends ye have thee known of long,
Will not regard thy enemies tongue.
The virtue that has ever been,
within thy tender breast:
Which I from year to year, have seen,
in all thy deeds expressed:
Does me persuade thy enemies lie,
And in that quarrel would I dye.
That wisdom which you do posses,
is rare for to be found:
Thy courtesse to every one,
so greatly does abound.
That those which throwly thee do know,
Will thee defend from any foe.
*Wherefore as earth I write to thee,
pluck up that heart of thine:
And make account for friendship, or
for service: else of mine.
I will not fail for friend or foe,
Thy virtues they do bind me so.
*Thus wishing God to be your guide,
and grant you Nestors life:
With health and haps, so good as erst,
had any maybe or wife.
I end and rest in what he may,
Your friend unto my dyeing day.
By me C. B.

*To my Friend Master T. L. whose good nature: I see abusde.
Did not Dame Seres tell to you?
nor fame unto you show?
What sturdi ^^orms have bin abrod
and who has played the shrew.
I thought yt Goddess in your feelds
had helped with your crop:
Or else ye fame iil you had known,
her trump would never stop.
But since I se their silentnesse,
I cease the same to write:
Least I therefore might be condemd
to do it for a spite.
But this I wish that you my frind
go choose some virtues wife:
With who^ in fear of God do spend,
the residue of your life
For whylst you are in single state
none has that right regard:
They think all well ye they can win,
and count it their reward.
With sorrow I to often have seen,
when some would fleece you much
And often in writting would I lay
good friend beware of such.
But all my mordes they wear as wind
my labor ill was spent:
And in the end for my good will,
most cruelly was thent.
If I were hort and buffeted,
good will shall never cease:
Nor hand, nor to^g, shall so be charmd
to make me hold my peace.
Wherefore I warn you once again
be wary of your self:
For some have sworn to like you well
so long as you have pelf,
If warnings still you do reject,
to late your self shall rue:
Do as you list, I wish you well,
and so I say ade we.
Your Welwiller. IS. VV.

Another Letter sent to IS. VV by one: to whom she had written her unfortunate
state.
YOur Letter (Cousin) scarley scene,
I caught into my hand:
In hope thereby some happy news,
from you to understand,
But when I had surnaid the same, and waid the teuor well
A beuy heap of sorrows did, miformer joys expel.
I do reioyes, as does the Swanne, who ready for to dye,
With buryall song salutes, her hard and doleful destiny.
In deed, I se and kno to well, how fortune spites your wealth:
And as a tirane Goddess, does disdain your happy health.
Whose poison serpentine I trust, in time shall wasted be,
Let time entends the greatest miss, and lets the captive free.
Wherefore (good Cosyn) as before, so now my barren quill
Disdayneth not in simple sort, so utter his good will.
And to discharge the duty that, belongs to a friend,
Whose wealth, I would to God were such, as might your case amend
But luck preue^ting every mean, that might your harms redress
Denies power to me that do, a fre^dly mind possess
Yet Cosyn, rest in perfect hope, to see the happy day,
That shall unlade your heped, grief, and drive your cares a way
And since the con^sel of the Gods surpass the humayne wit.
Remember what the proverb says: hereafter coms not yet.
And po^der well ye Shipma^s case, whose death, ye tossing tide
Does threaten of reassaulting sore his shaken Ship with pride
Yet when NEPTVNVS staieth, and calmes the Seas again,
His joys more ample are by far, then theirs ye did co^plain
He tells at home with iocund mind among his friend and kyn
The danger great, and deep despair, that erst his life was in
Triu^phyng over Neptunes spite, whose force he felt before:
And joys to view the Seas, when he obtained has ye shore
So when the floods, of Fortunes spite ye swel with foming rage
Shall sti^t their strugli^g strif, and when their malice shall as wage
Then may you gain, and long enjoy the Haven of good hap:
For Nurses chideful often, before they lull their child in lap.
And take delight perhaps to tell, what trobles erst I knew,
whose bare rehearsal might enforce, a stony heart to rue.
why should we the^, with such disdain: endure the chastisme^t
wherbi, perhaps, the Gods in us, some further harms p^uent
And since no creature may deserve, Dame Iunos graces well
Whi should we grudg, and blame the gods, whose goodness does excel
Whereas our duty binds us, their doyngs to allow:
Whose actions all ^^e for the best, when we perceive not how
We rather should with (...) mind, abide the dated time
Wherein the Gods shall us account, as worthy for to clime.
Which after trial shall betide, to those that suffer smarte:
For: he does ill deserve ye sweet, yt tastes not ye tarte
Which argues those ye for a while, does hide ye bru^t of pain
To be the owners of good hap, when Fortune turns again
Whose number, I beseech the Gods your self may furnish out,
And that his eyes may see you plaste, amid that happi rowt
Whose great good wit shall never die: although the want of time
Has don me wrong, and ever does: in shortning of my rhyme.
Your most loving Cosyn. G. VV.

IS. VV. being weary of writing, sends this for Answer.
NO less then thanks, I render unto you,
What, though it be a Beggars bare reward
Accept the same: (for Cosyn this is true,
It Is all I have: my haps they are so hard:
None bears life, is so from Fortune bard,
But this I know, and hope it once to find
God can, and will, exalt the humble mind.
*This simple verce: content you for to take
for answer of your loving letter lardge,
For now I will my writting clean forsake
till of my griefs, my stomach I discharg:
and till I row, in Lady Fortunes barge.
Good Cousin write not nor any more replye,
But give me leave, more quietness to try,
Your Cousin IS. VV.

The Aucthour (though loath to leave the City) upon her Friends procurement,
is constrained to depart: wherefore (she fayneth as she would die) and makes
her WILL and Testament, as solo weth: With large Legacies of such Goods and
riches which she most abundantly has left behind her: and thereof makes
LONdon sole executor to se her Legacies performed.
A comunication which the Auctor had to London, before she made her Will.
THe time is come I must depart,
from thee ah famous City:
I never yet to rue my smart,
did find that thou had pity,
Wherefore small cause there is, yt I
should grieve from thee go:
But many Women foolyshly,
like me, and other more,
Do such a fyxed fancy set,
on those which least desarue,
That long it is ere wit we get,
away from them to swerve,
But time with pity often will tell
to those that will her try:
Whether it best be more to mell,
or utterly defye.
And now has time me put and mind,
of thy great cruelnes:
That never once a help would find,
to ease me in distres.
Thou never yet, woldst credit give
to board me for a year:
Nor with Apparel me releue
except thou paid wear.
No, no, thou never did me good,
nor ever wilt I know:
Yet am I in no angry mood,
but will, or ere I go
In perfect love and charytie,
my Testament here write:
And leave to thee such Treasurye,
as I in it recyte.
Now stand a side and give me leave
to write my latest Will:
And see that none you do deceive,
of that I leave them till.
The manner of her Will, and what she left to London: and to all those in it: at
her departing.
I Whole in body, and in mind,
but very weak in Purse:
Do make, and write my Testament
for fear it will be wurse.
And first I wholly do commend,
my Soul and Body eke:
To God the Father and the Son,
so long as I can speak.
And after speech: my Soul to him,
and Body to the Grave:
Till time that all shall rise again,
their Judgment for to have.
And then I hope they both shall meet,
to dwell for^^^^^ Joy:
Whereas I trust to ^^e my Friends
releast, from all annoy.
Thus have you heard touching my soul,
and body what I mean:
I trust you all will witness hear,
I have a steadfast wayne.
And now let me dispose such things,
as I shall leave behind:
That those which shall receive the same,
may knowing wylling mind.
I first of all to London leave
because I there was bred:
Brave buildyngs rare, of Churches store,
and Paul's to the head.
Between the same: fair streats there be,
and people goodly store:
Because their keeping craves cost,
I yet will leave him more.
First for their food, I Butchers leave,
that every day shall kill:
By Thames you shall have Brewers store,
and Bakers at your will.
And such as orders do observe,
and eat fish thrice a week:
I leave two Street; full fraught therewith,
they need not far to seek.
Watlyng Street, and Canwyck street,
I full of Woollen leave:
And Linen store in Friday street,
if they me not deceive.
And those which are of calling such,
that costlier they require:
I Mercers leave, with silk so rich,
as any would desire.
In Cheap of them, they store shall find
and likewise in that street:
I Goldsmithes leave, with Iuels such,
as are for Ladies mere.
And Plate to furnysh Cubhards with,
full brave there shall you find:
With Purle of Silver and of Gold,
to satisfye your mind.
With Hoods, Bungraces, Hats or Caps,
such store are in that street:
As if on ton side you should miss
the fother serves you feet,
For Nets of every kind of sort,
I leave within the pawn;
French Ruffes, high Purles, Gorgets and Sleeves
of any kind of Lawne.
For Purse or Knives, for Comb or Glass,
or any needeful knacke
I by the Stoks have left a Boy,
will ask you what you lack.
I Hose do leave in Birchin Lane,
of any kind of syse:
For Women stitchte, for men both Trunks
and those of Gascoyne gise.
Boots, Shoes or Mantables good store,
Saint Martins has for you:
In Cornwall, there I leave you Beds,
and all that long thereto.
For Women shall you Taylore have,
by Bow, the chiefest dwell:
In every Lane you some shall find,
can do indifferent well.
And for the men, few Streets or Lanes,
but Bodymakers be:
And such as make the sweeping Cloakes,
with Gardes beneth the Knee.
Artyllery at Temple Bar,
and Dagges at Tower hill:
Swords and Bucklers of the best,
are nigh the Fleet until.
Now when thy Folk are fed and clad
with such as I have namde:
For daynty mouths, and stomachs weaks
some Iunckets must be framde.
Wherefore I Poticaries leave,
with Banquets in their Shop:
Phisicians also for the sick,
Diseases for to stop,
Some Roysters still, must hide in thee,
and such as cut it out:
That with the guiltless quarrel will,
to let their blood about.
For them I cunning Surgions leave,
some Playsters to apply.
That Ruffians may not still be hangde,
nor quiet persons dye.
For Salt, Otemeale, Candles, Soap,
or what you else do want:
In many places, Shops are full,
I left you nothing scant.
If they that keep what I you leave,
ask Money: when they sell it:
At Mint, there is such store, it is
impossible to tell it.
At Stiliarde store of Wines there be,
your dulled minds to glad:
And handsome men, that must not well
except they leave their trade.
They often shall seek for proper Gyrles,
and some perhaps shall find:
(That need compels, or lucre lurse
to satisfye their mind.
And near the same, I houses leave,
for people to repair:
To bathe themselves, so to prevent
infection of the air.
On Saturdayes I wish that those,
which all the week do drug:
Shall thither trudge, to trim them up
on Sondayes to look smug.
If any other thing be lackt
in thee, I wysh them look:
For there it is: I little brought
but nothing from thee took.
Now for the people in the left,
I have done as I may:
And that the poor, when I am gone,
have cause for me ^^^ray.
I will to prisons persons leave,
what though but very small:
Yet that they may remember me,
occasion be it shall:
And first the Counter they shall have,
least they should go to wrack:
Some Coggers and some honest men,
that Sergantes draw a back.
And such as Friends will not them bail,
whose coin the is very thin:
For them I leave a certain hole,
and little ease within.
The Newgate, once a Monthe shall have
a sessions for his share:
Least being heapt, Infection might
procure a further care.
And at those sessions some shall skape,
with burning nere the Thumb.
And afterward to beg their fees
till they have got the some.
And such whose deeds deserves death,
and twelve have found the same:
They shall be drawn up Holborne hill,
to come to further shame:
Well, yet to such I leave a Nag
shall soon their sorrows cease:
For he shall either break their necks
or gallop from the preace.
The Fleet, not in their circuit is,
yet If I give him naught:
It might procure vss curse, ere I
unto the ground be brought.
Wherefore I leave some Papist old
to under prop his roof:
And to the poor within the same,
a Bore for their behoof.
What makes you standers by to smile.
and laugh so in your sleeue:
I think it is, because that I
to Ludgate nothing give.
I am not now in case to lie,
here is no place of jest:
I did reserve, that for my self,
if I my health possessed.
And ever came in credit so
a debtor for to be.
When days of payment did approach,
I thither meant to flee.
To shroude my self amongst the rest,
that choose to dye in debt:
Rather then any Creditor,
should money from them get.
Yet cause I feel my self so weak
that none me credit dare:
I here revoke: and do it leave,
some Banckrupts to his share.
To all the Booke^^^^^s by Paulles
because I like their Art:
They ery week shall money have,
when they from Books depart.
Amongst them all, my Printer must,
have some what to his share:
I will my Friends them Books is bye
of him, with other ware
For, Maiden poor, I Widdoers rich,
do leave, that often shall date:
And by that means shall mary them,
to set the Girls aflote.
And wealthy Widows will I leave,
to help young Gentylmen:
Which when you have, in any case
be courteous to them then:
And see their Plate and Jewels eake
may not be mard with rust.
Nor let their Bags too long be full,
for fear that they do burst.
To ery Gate under the walls,
that compass thee about:
I Fruit wines leave to entertayne
such as come in and out.
To Smithfeelde I must something leave
my Parents there did dwell:
So careless for to be of it,
none would account it well.
Wherefore it thrice a week shall have,
of Worse and neat good store.
And in his Spitle, blind and lame,
to dwell for evermore.
And Bedlem must not be forgot,
for that was often my walk:
I people there too many leave,
that out of tune do talk.
At Bridewel there shall Bedelles be,
and Matrones that shall still
See Chalk well chopped, and spinning plyde;
and turning of the Mill.
For such as cannot quiet be,
but strive for House or Land:
At Th'innes of Court, I Lawyers leave
to take their cause in hand.
And also leave I at each Inn
of Court, or Chauncerye:
Of Gentylmen, a youthful root,
full of Actiuytie:
For whom I store of Books have left,
at each Bookebinders stall:
And part of all that London has
to furnish them withal.
And when they are with study cloyd:
to recreate their mind:
Of Tennis Courts, of dancing Scooles,
and fence they store shall find.
And every Sunday at the least,
I leave to make them sport.
In diverse places Players, that
of wonders shall report.
Now London have I (for thy sake)
within thee, and without:
As coms into my memory,
disspearsed round about
Such needful things, as they should have
here left now unto thee:
When I am gone, with consience.
let them dispearced he.
And though I nothing named have,
to bury mae withal:
Consider that above the ground,
annoyance be I shall.
And let me have a shrowding Sheet
to cover me from shame:
And in obliuyon bury me
and never more me name.
Ringings nor other Ceremonies,
use you not for cost:
Nor at my burial, make no feast,
your money were but lost.
Rejoice in God that I am gone,
out of this vale to vile.
And that of each thing, left such store,
as may your wants exile.
I make thee sole executor, because
I lou'de thee best.
And thee I put in trust, to give
the goods unto the rest.
Because thou shall a helper need,
In this so great a chardge,
I wysh good Fortune, be thy guide, least
thou should run at lardge.
The happy days and quiet times,
they both her Servants be.
Which well will serve to fetch and bring,
such things as need to thee.
Wherefore (good London) not refuse,
for helper her to take:
Thus being weak and weary both
an end here will I make.
To all that ask what end I made,
and how I went away:
Thou answer may like those which here,
no longer tarry may.
And unto all that wysh me well,
or rue that I am gone:
Do me comend, and bid them cease
my absence for to moan.
And tell them further, if they would,
my presence still have had:
They should have sought to mend my luck;
which ever was too bad.
So fare thou well a thousand times,
God sheelde thee from thy foe:
And still make thee victorious,
of those that seek thy woe.
And (though I am persuade) that I
shall never more thee see:
Yet to the ^^^^^not cease
to wish m^o thee
This, xx. of O^^ober I,
in ANNO DOMIN^^
A Thousand: v. hundred ^^^^^^
as Alminacks de^^^^
Did write this (...)ne hand
and it to London gave:
In witness of the standers by,
whose names if you will have
Paper, Pen and Standish were
at that same present by:
With Time, who promised to reveal,
so fast as she could by^
The same: least of my ^,
for anything should vary:
So finally I make an end
no longer can I tarry.
