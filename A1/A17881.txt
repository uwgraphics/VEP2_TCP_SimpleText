LONDON: Printed by Tho. Snodham, for Matthew Low^^^, and I. Brow^^ Cum
Priuilegio.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, BOTH in Birth and Virtue, FRANCIS, Earl of
CVMBERLAND.
WHat Patron could I choose, great Lord, but you?
Grave words your years may challenge as their own,
And every note of Music is your due,
Whose House the Muses palace I have known.
To love and cherish them, though it descends
With many honors more on you, in vain
Preceding fame herein with you contends,
Who have both fed the Muses, and their train.
These Leaves I offer you, Devotion might
Her self lay open, read them, or else hear
How gravely with their tunes they yield delight
To any virtuous, and not curious ear.
Such as they are accept them Noble Lord;
If better, better could my zeal afford.
Your Honors, THOMAS CAMPIAN.

TO THE READER.
OVT of many Songs which partly at the request of friends, partly for my own
recreation were by me long since composed, I have now enfranchised a few,
sending them forth divided according to their different subject into several
Books. The first are grave and pious; the second amorous and light. For he
that in publishing any work, has a desire to content all palates, must cater
for them accordingly.

-- Non omnibus vnum est
Quod placet, hic Spinas colligit, ille Rosas.
These Airs were for the most part framed at first for one voice with the
Lute, or Violl, but upon occasion, they have since been filled with more
parts, which who so please may use, who like not may leave. Yet do we daily
observe, that when any shall sing a Treble to an Instrument, the standers by
will be offering at an inward part out of their own nature; and true or false,
out it must, though to the perverting of the whole harmony. Also, if we
consider well, the Treble tunes, which are with us commonly called Airs, are
but Tenors mounted eight Notes higher, and therefore an inward part must needs
well become them, such as may take up the whole distance of the Diapason, and
fill up the gaping between the two extreme parts; whereby though they are not
three parts in perfection, yet they yield a sweetness and content both to the
ear and mind, which is the aim and perfection of Music. Short Airs if
they be skilfully framed, and naturally expressed, are like quick and good
Epigrammes in Poesy, many of them showing as much artifice, and breeding as
great difficulty as a larger Poem. Non omnia possumus omnes, said the Roman
Epick Poet. But some there are who admit only French or Italian Airs, as if
every Country had not his proper Air, which the people thereof naturally
usurp in their Music. Others taste nothing that comes forth in Print, as if
Catullus or Martials Epigrammes were the worse for being published. In these
English Airs I have chiefly aimed to couple my Words and Notes lovingly
together, which will be much for him to do that has not power over both. The
light of this will best appear to him who has pays'd our Monasyllables and
Syllables combined, both which are so loaded with Consonants as that they will
hardly keep company with swift Notes, or give the Vowell convenient liberty.
To conclude; mine own opinion of these Songs I deliver thus: Omnia nec nostris
bona sunt, sed nec mala libris;
Si placet hac cantes, hac quoque lege legas.


Farewell.

Sweet showers of pity rain, wash my uncleanness pure.

The faint and ^ading heart can raise, and in joys bosom place.
Sin and Death, Hell and tempting Fiends may rage;
But God his own will guard, and their sharp pains and grief in time assuage.

1
The man of life upright,
Whose cheerful mind is free
From weight of impious deeds,
and yoke of vanitee.
2
The man whose silent days
In harm^lesse joys are spent:
Whom hopes cannot delude,
Nor sorrows discontent.
3
That man needs neither towers,
Nor armor for defense:
Nor vaults his guilt to shroud
From thunders violence.
4
He only can behold
With vnaffrighted eyes
The horrors of the deep,
And terrors of the Skies.
5
Thus scorning all the cares,
That fate or fortune brings:
His Book the Heavens he makes
His wisdom heavenly things.
6
Good thoughts his sur^st friends,
His wealth a well-spent age,
The earth his sober Inn,
And quiet pilgrimage.

Where are all thy beauties now all hearts enchayning?
Whither are thy flatt'rers gone with all their fayning?
All fled, and thou alone still here remaining.

Thy rich state of twisted gold to Bays is turned;
Cold as thou art are thy loves that so much burned:
Who dye in flatt'rers arms are seldom mourned.
3
Yet in spite of en^ie, this be still proclaimed,
That none worthyer then thy self thy worth has blamed:
When their poor names are lost thou shall li^e fa^ed.

When thy story long time hence shall be perused,
Let the blemish of thy rule be thus excused,
None ever lived more just, none more abused.

Their sinne-sicke souls by him shall be recured.

Cleanse me Lord that I may kneel
At thine Altar pure and white,
They that once thy Mercies feel,
Gaze no more on earths delight.

Worldly joys like shadows fade,
When the heavenly light appears,
But the cou'nants thou have made
Endless, know no^ days, nor years.

To thy mercies fast I fly,
Though I am but clay and dust,
Yet thy grace can lift me high.

Bravely decked come forth bright day,
Thine hours with Roses strew thy way,
As they well remember.
Thou received shall be with feasts,
Come chiefest of the British ghests,
Thou fifth of November.
Thou with triumph shall exceed
In the strictest ember;
For by thy return the Lord records his blessed deed.
2
Britains frolic at your bourd,
But first sing praises to the Lord
In your Congregations.
He preserved your state alone,
His loving grace has made you one
Of his chosen Nations.
But this light must hallowed be
With your best Oblations;
Praise the Lord, for only great and merciful is he.
3
Death had entered in the gate,
And ruin was crept near the State;
But heaven all revealed.
^^ry Powder hell did make,
Which ready long the flame to take,
Lay in shade concealed.
God us helped of his free grace,
None to him appea^ed;
For none was so bad to fear the treason or the place.
4
God his peaceful Monarch chose,
To him the mist he did disclose,
To him, and none other;
This he did O King for thee,
That thou thine own ^enowne might see,
Which no time can smother:
May blessed Charles thy comfort be
Firmer then his Brother,
May his heart the love of peace, and wisdom learn from thee.

2
All earthly pomp or beauty to express,

Our silent Harps we pensive hung:

To be profaned in foreign land?
O Salem thee when I forget
Forget his skill may my right hand!

Fast to the roof cleave may my tongue
If mindelesse I of thee be found:
Or if when all my joys are sung
Jerusalem be not the ground.

Remember Lord how Edems race
Cried in Ierusalems sad day,
Hurl down her walls, her towers deface,

Just ruin yet for thee remains:
Blessed shall they be thy babes that take,

First who taught the day
From the East to rise:
Whom does the Sun obey
When in the Seas his glory dies?
4
He the Stars directs,
That in order stand:
Who heaven and earth protects,
But he that framed them with his hand?
5
Angels round attend,
Waiting on his will:
Armed millions he does send,
To aid the good, or plague the ill.
6
All that dread his Name,
And his Hests observe,
His arm will shield from shame,
Their steps from truth shall never swer^e.
7
Let us then rejoice,
Sounding loud his praise:
So will he hear our voice,
And bless on earth our peaceful days.

His youth was like an April flower,
Adorned with beauty, love, and power,
Glory strow'd his way,
Whose wreaths gay
Now are all turned to decay.

None feel more cause then we.

No more may his wished sight return,
His golden Lamp no more can burn;
Quenched is all his flame,
His hoped fame
Now has left him naught but name.
For him all weep with me,
Since more him none shall see.
TO THE RIGHT NOBLE, AND VIRTUOUS, HENRY Lord CLIFFORD, Son and Heir to the
Right Honorable, FRANCIS, Earl of CVMBERLAND.
SVch days as wear the badge of holy red,
Are for devotion marked, and sage delight;
The vulgar Low-dayes vndistinguished,
Are left for labor, games, and sportfull sights.
This seu'rall and so differing use of Time,
Within th'enclosure of one week we find,
Which I resemble in my Notes and Rhyme,
Expressing both in their peculiar kind.
Pure Hymns, such as the seventh day loves, do lead,
Grave age did justly challenge those of me:
These weeke-day works in order that succeed,
Your youth best fits, and yours young Lord they be:
As he is, who to them their being gave,
If the one, the other you of force must have:
Your Honors, THOMAS CAMPIAN.

To the READER.
THat holy Hymns with Lovers cares are knit
Both in one Quire here, thou may think it unfit;
Why do not blame the Stationer as well,
Who in the same Shop sets all sorts to sell?
Divine with styles profane, grave shelu'd with vain;
And some matched worse, yet none of him complain.

How rich of golden hope, and gay delight?
What heart cannot a modest beauty move?
Who seeing clear day once will dream of night?
She seemed a Saint that brake her faith with me,
But proved a woman as all other be.

Unhappy men in them may never find,
Ah but without them none; both must consent,
Else uncouth are they joys of either kind.

All th'attempts that beauty moves:

It Is but her due to be desired:

If their deserts were not admired?

Want often what their will embraced.

When true thieves use falsehood well,
As they are wise they will be caught.

Some hope yet remains for me:
Prayer or sacrifice may gain
From her implored grace relief,
To release me of my pain,
Or at the least to ease my grief.

Young am I, and far from guile,
The more is my woe the while:
Falsehood with a smooth disguise
My simple meaning has abused,
Casting mists before mine eyes,
By which my senses are confused.

Fair he is who vowed to me,
That he only mine would be:
But alas, his mind is caught
With every gaudie bait he sees.
And too late my flame is taught
That too much kindness makes men freese.
5
From me all my friends are gone,
While I pine for him alone,
And not one will rue my case,
But rather my distress deride,
That I think there is no place
Where pity ever yet did bide.
