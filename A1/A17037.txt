A TRVE AND SHORT DECLARATION, BOTH OF THE GATHERING AND JOINING TOGETHER OF
CERTAIN PERSONS: AND ALSO OF THE LAMENTABLE BREACH AND DIVISION WHICH FELL
AMONGST THEM.
THERE Were certain persons in England, of which, some were brought up in
schools, and in the University of Cambridge, and some in families and
houshouldes, as is the manner of that co^ntrie. Some of these which had lived
and studied in Cambrige, were there known and counted forvvard in religion,
and others also both there and in the contrie were more careful and zealous,
then their froward enemies could suffer. They in Cambrige were scattered from
thense, so^e to one tra^e of life, and some to an other: as Robert Broune,
Robert Harrison, William Harrison, Philip Broune, Robert Barker. Some of of
these applied the^ selves to teach scholars: to the vvh^ch labor, R. Broune
also gave hi^ self* for the space of three years. He having a special care to
teach religion with other learning* did thereby keep his sch^llers in such
(...) and good order, as all the Tounseme^ where he taught gave him witness.
Yet the world being so corrupt as it is, and the times so perilous he greatly
misliked the wants and defaultes, which he savve every where, and marcked
plai^ly that without red^esse, nether the parents could long reioise in their
children, nor the children profit so much ^n religion, as that their other
studies and learning might be blessed thereby Hereuppon he fell into great
care, and was soar greened while he long considered m^nie things amiss,
and the cause of all, to be the woeful and lamentable state off the church.
Wherefore he labored much to know his duty in such things, and because
the church of God is his kingdom, and his name especially is thereby magn^fied*
he wholy bent him self to searh and find out the matters of the church: as
how it was to be guided and ordered, and what abuses there were in the
ecclesiastical government then used. These things, he had long before debated
in him self, and with others, and suffered also some trouble about the^ at
Ca^brige* yet now on fresh he set his mind on these things, and night and
day did consult with him self and others about the^, least he should be
ignorant, or mistake any off those matters. What so ever things he ff^und
b^longing to the church, and to his calling as a member off the church, he did
put it in p^^ctis For eu^n l^tle children are off the church and kingdom off
God yea off such says Christ does his kingdom consist: and therefore both in
his schole he labored that the kingdom off God might appear, and also in
those of the town with whom he kept company. So by word and practisse he
tried out all thigs, that he might be stayed both in judgment and counsel, and
also in enterprising matters, as his duty should lead him. But this his
dealr^g got hi^ much envy of the preacher and so^e others where he taught,
and much trouble also when he broke ^is mi^d more plainly unto the^.
Prese^tlie after this he was dischargeed of his schole by the grudge of his
enemies. Yet he taught still, with great good Will and favor of the
Tounseme^, till such time as the pl^gue increased in the Town and he was
sent for avvai by his fre^des. Therefore because his scholars, th^ugh never so
Well plied and profited by him, were notvvithstanding, either flitting away
Upon such occasions, or to bast^lie sent to the University, or because of
their misguiding there, to some occupations, by thought th^^ the fruict of his
labor Was toe much uncertain, and took counsel if by so^e better way h^
might profit the church. Then he gave warning to the Town and departed to
come home, as his rather willed him. So might h^ have lived with his father,
b^ing a man of some countenance, and have vvanted noethinge, if he hadd been
so disposed but his care as alvvayes before. so then especially being set on
the church of God, he asked leave of his father, and took his Journey to
Ca^bridge from vvhe^se a fevv years before he had departed. He there had
deali^g with M. Gree^ha^ of dreito^, vvho^e of all others he hard fai was
most forwards, and thought that With him and by him he should have some stai
of his care and hope of his purpo^e. Wherefore, as those which in old time
were called the prophets and children of the prophets and lived to gether,
because of corruptions among others, so came he unto him. He was suffered, as
others also in his his house, to speak of that part of scripture, Which was
used to be red after m^ales. And although he said, that without leave and
special word from the bishop, he was to s^ff^r none to teach openly in his
parish* yet Without any such leave he suffered R. B. Notvvithstanding, when
R. B. savve, that the dishops feet were to much set in every place, and that
spiritual infectio^ to much spread eue^ to the best reformed places, he took
that occasion vvh^^h the Lord did first give him for redress, and when
certain in Cambr^g^ h^d boa^h ^oue^ hi^, and also with consent of the Mayor
and Vicechancelar, called him to preach among them, he dealt in this manner.

He first considered the state of Cambrige, how the church of God was
planted therein. For he judged that the church was to call and receive him, if
he should be there chosen and appointed to prea^h. Then did he thinck on this,
who should be ch^^fest, or have charge before others, to look to such
matters. For the bishops take upon them the chieftie, but to be called and
a^thorised by them, he thought it vnlavvefull. And why he was of this mind,
he had these and such like vvarrantes: namely they should be chiefest, which
partake unto us the chiefest gr^^es, and use of their callinges. And that does
Christ, as it is written, of his fullnes have all we re^e^ued, and grace for
grace. Ioh. 1. 16. And to him has God made all things subject sa^e^h Pa^l,
Ephesians. 1. 22. eue^ under his feet, and has appointed him over all things, to
be the head of the church, which is his body, even the fullnes of him, which
fills all in all things. Now next under Christ, is not the bishop of the
dioces, by vvho^e so many mischiefs are wrought, nether any one which has
but single authority, but first they that have their authority together: as
first the church, which Christ also teaches, where he says, If he will
not vouchsafe to hear them tell it unto the church, and if he refuse to hear
the church also, let him be unto the, as an heathen man and a publican. Mat 18
17. Therefore is the church called the pillar and ground of truth. 1. Tim. 3.
15. and the voice of the Whole people, g^ided bie the elders and forvvard^st,
is said to be the voice of God And that 149. p^alme does sh^vne this great
honor, Vvhi^h is to all the saints Therefore the meetinges together of many
churches, also of every Vvh^le church, and of the ^lders therein, is ab^ue the
Apostle, above the Prophet, the E^ang^list, the Pastor, the Tea^h^r* and every
particul^^ ^lder. For the ^oining and partaking of ^anie churches tog^^h^r* and
of the authority Which many have, must needs be greater and more Vvaighti^,
^h^n the authority of any si^gle person. And this al^oe meant Pa^l Where he
says* 1. Cor 2. 22. We are yours, and you are Christ's, and Christ is Go^es.
So that the Apostle is inferior to the church* and the church is infer^or to
Christ* and Christ concerning his manhood and offi^e in the church, is inferior
to God. This he iudg^d, not only toe be against the Vvicked^e^ of the
b^sh^pes, but al^o against their Whole power and authority. For if the
authority of the church, and of the forvva^dest breethren or elders therein,
be above the bishopes, how should it not follovue* but that the bishopes may
be commanded, accused and charged bie the church* yea also discharged and
separated as is their desert? But now because of their popish power and
canon laws, they have lift up their authority more high, the^ the church
can take accountes of them: and not only by force do thrust out and trouble
Whom they list, but also reign as Lords and Dukes in their dioces, their
authority must needs be usurped. For the Apostles did give accou^tes to the
church of all their doings, as We read in the Act. 11. 4. Act 15. 2. 3. and
Romans 15, 31. But these being got above the Apostles, Will sit in the throne of
Christ, and as Christ is not inferior to the church, no more Will they be. For
Christ has chose^ us, says the scripture, and not We him, Ioh. 15, 16. and
therefore he is greater the^ us all. And sei^g the church can not chose the
bishopes, nor those hirelinges, Whom the bishopes thurst upon them,
therefore the^ also Will be greater then the church, and With Whom then do
they compare them selves in degree, but With Christ? and so make them selves
antichrists. Nai they presume further then Christ Which vvould^ not thrust
his Apostles voo^ any congrega^io^, nor suffer them to take charge of any
Which did not Willingly receive the^* Lu^. 10. 10. But these do force upon
the people every Where, and in sundry places against their vvilles, not
only ministers vnknovu^e, but also such as are knovue^ to be blind busserdes,
Wicked f^llo^ves and idol sh^pherdes. Likewise Christ has al rule in his
hand; as it is Written that we a^e complete in him, Which is the head of
all pri^cipalitie and power Col. 2. and he can not sin, nor offend the law
of God, nor be accused by the same. For ^o the ^cripture testifi^th* that none
could reprove him of sin, though he off^red him self to them to ac^use him
^f ^h^i could Ioh 8. And he is that high priest, as again it is Vv^itten Heb.
7 which is holy, harmless* Undefiled, separate from sinners, and made high^r
th^^ the heavens How* h^g^ then ^o the^ lift ^h^m selves, Which W^ll rule
alone a^ lords over the sto^k, though the word has said i^ shall not be so?
Lu^. 22. 26. ^. Pet. 5. 3. Which will be R^^bi^s, Doctors and reueren^
^^^hers, though We have b^t one docto^ and Father as (...) h^gh (...). ^at.

vv^ll ^ot (...) ra^g^ ^o ^et the^ L^c. 19 14. For the^ have refused his
government, and ch^^en their own pop^^h ^^scipl^^e in stea^ thereof.

This appears, because they enter and tak^ on them their offi^e^ in pop^sh
wise, and as ^ha^ ^^vve praescribeth the^, and also do misg^id the people by
th^^ ^op^sh tyra^nie. For who knovveth not, but that they vv^tch for the
living or bysh^p ^^ke, when it shall fall, and then se^^e and p^ye well for
the same, if they obtain it ^o are they ravenous and wicked persons, as says
the c^pture, Z^c. 3. They are mak^ sh^ftes and troublers, seeing they rule
rath^r because they seek their own advantage, or glory, or ^^sh^henous
p^rpose, then the vvelfare and benef^ of the church Yea they all look to their
own way as sai^th ^he Prophet, Esa. 56. 11. every one for his a^ua^tage
and for his own p^rpose Who knovve^h not also, but that they vvhi^h are not
duly ^eceaued and called to guide, and that by due consent and agreement, they
are either Antichrists in the church, or Tyrants in the common wealth, because
they vs^rp in the church or commo^vvelth Such are they of whom Paul speaks*
2 Cor. 11. 20 that the cori^thians did suffer them to much. For they did suffer
if a man brought them into bondage, if a man devoured, if a ma^n took, if a
man exalted him self, if a man smote them on the face. For in deed the people
do suffer the bishops, though they take from them their l^bertie ^f chosing
good pastors and refusing evil, yea they suffer them selves to be robbed and
beaten by those spiritual courts, they suffer the great unto vvardnes and
wickedness of the bishops to be colored and hidden by their outvvard brag
and countenance, as by their pomp, authority, tytls, and power, and some
times by their fair flattering sermons and pleasings. For they rule by three
sorts of laws, as by the civil, the cano^, the common law, which are
three kingdoms unto them, or as the Popes triple crown, and by pretending
the fourth law, which is the word of God, they ouerrule totoe much: they
spare not to come upon the people with force and power, and they care not to
bridle them with new and yearly injunctions and al^o with the old laws
and penalties of the court of Rome. While R. B. thought these things ^n him
self, he moved the matter diverse times unto others. Some did gainsay and those
of the ^orvvardest, affirming that the bishops authority is tolerable, and he
might take license and ^^^horitie of them. Others of them said they vvoulde
not counsel nor meddle for an other ma^^ conscience in that matter* but they
them selves judged, that the bishops preached the vvo^d of God, and therefore
ought not lightly to be rejected. Also they said, that seeing they had the
word and the sacraments, they must needs have vvithall the church and people
of God: and seeing this was under the government of the bishops and by means of
the^, they could not wholy condem the bishops, but rather judge them faulty
in some part. Then did R. B. again and again discuss these matters, as he
had often before, as whether the byshopes could be said to preach the word
of God and minister the sacraments or no. For if that were true, then also
might they call and place ministers: and seeing they them selves did minister so
great ^ thing as is the word and the sacraments, they might also minister
their help in other things not so great. Therefore to know whether they
preached the word of God, he searched and found by the scriptures, what it is
to preach the word: namely to do the Lords message as i^ is written in
Jeremy 23. 22 in teaching the people those things, whereby they might turn
them from their evil ways and from the wickedness of their inventions.
Therefore excep^ they have a due message, they can not preach the word off
message. For I sent them not saie^^ the Lord in that place, nor commanded
them, therefore they bring no profit unto this people. Again except they
preach those things first, ffor vvhi^h first and chiefly they were sen^
namely what so^uer is to reclame ^he people, first from some especial
wickedness, vvherin they sin, and s^ ff^^m all other d^ff^^l^es, they can not
be said to preach the word. Therefore seeing the b^sh^pes calling and
authority vuas shevved before for to be vnlavvefull, and seeing also they call
not the people from the ^h^if^st abominations, Which are the cause of the
rest, but rathe^ vvi^f^lly and with cruelty do lead them in the same, as
will afterward appear* they can not preach the word of God. For to make a
sermon is not to preach the word of God, no, nor yet to make a true sermon.
For the servant that tells a true tale has not done his masters mess^ge,
nor the arraunt for the which he was sent, except he tell and speak that for
the which his master sent him. Therefore though the byshopes teach the
people, and give them laws, and make many iniunct^ons, yea though they be
laws of Christ, yet if they abuse the obedience of the people, to houl^e and
follow with some laws of Christ their own laws ^speciallie, what are
they but antichrists? And how can they then but only in name and in shevve,
preach the laws of Ch^^st? For example while they pervert the law of God
in this, they can not be said to preach his law: namely whereas God
commands to plant and to build his church, by gathering the vvorthie and
refusing the unworthy. Mat. 10. 11. Act. 19 9. Ezr. 6. 21. they book by
their contrary laws both papists and careless worldlings, as crooked trees
to b^il^ the lords sanctuary, and force the vvretched to their vvorshippings
and service, as if dogs might be thurst upon God for svveet sacrifice. Proud
forceing is meek building with them and devotion compelled is their right
religion. Thus herein they pollute the Lords sanctuary and wrest his law,
how much more by a thousand more abominatio^s whereof afterward we breiflie
touch some. For by the^ do they feed them selves and the people with the bread
of uncleanness, in stead of the puer word of God. They make it ready with the
dongue that comes of man, even with their traditions, tolerations, and
falsifiinges. And if the Pharisees made the word of God ofnone effect or
authority by their traditions, as it is vvritte^. Mark. 7 13. much more these.
They by their corbans or offering of guiftes, gave occasion to children to
dishonor their parents and these by their spiritual courts, by their s^ond
excommunications, dispensations, absolutio^s, etc. yea by their taking of
bribes and fees, do let so many lose to all misrule and filthiness They taught
the gould of the Temple to be greater then the temple, which sanctifies the
gould: Mat. 23. 17. and these teach that to sin is damnable: but to pollute
the Lords spiritual Temple by mingling the clean and vvretched together
which is the cause of all sin, is noe matter of damnation: forsooth it is a
thing tolerable because they can not remedy it. They taught that the offering
on the altar was greater then the altar, though it sanctify the offering and
these teach that to want the sacraments, that is lamentable, but to want the
kingdom of God, and the visible shevve of his rule in his church, whereby the
sacrament is sanctified that they make no matter. If then for such doctrine
they were called blind guides and fools by Christ him self, Mat. 23. 16, 17.
yea and though they sat in Moses seat, that is at first were lavvefullie
called to teach the people, yet the people were charged by Christ toe let
alone such blind guides, and not to be guided by them. Mat 15, 14. how much
more should we le^ these blind guides alone, which never were lavvfully
called and also sit in the seat of Anticbrist. ^or what is the seat of
Antichrist but that Popish Government and lordship in the communion of such
Romish offices, and horrible abuses by them. And while they sit in the temple
of God. ^ Thessalonians. ^. 4. and exalt their traditions above Gods, what are theie
but antichri^^* Do th^ie then preach the Lords word of message? or is not
h^s word a fire, and like an hammer that breaks the stone? lere. 23, 29 But
all their preaching can not break and bring men from any smaller or greater
disorders, which vnicked church laws or church Prelates co^maun^ them. Thus
was he se^led not to seek any approueing or authorizing off the b^shopes.
B^t because he knev^e the trouble that would follovue, (...) he so proceeded,
he sought means off quietness so much has was lavueffull: and for dealing
wi^h the b^shopes, he was of this judgment, that men may now deal with
them, as before ^he^ might with the pharisees: that is, so far as we nether
sin against God, no^ g^ue offense unto men. Thereffore if Christ did his
Fathers will, when he sat in the mid^es off the doctors, h^a^eing them, and
asking them quaestio^s* Luc. 2. 46 and ^ff Paul did his duty, when he sat
down in the synagogue, as it were offering him self, and seekeimg leave to
speak to the people* Act 13. 14. ^^ he also did lavueffullie apply him self
to their ceremonies, Act. 21 26 then thus far allo^ there meddling with the
bishopes, to try and prove them, or to be tried off them, as we see the like
did fall out in Christ, also to yield to their power, so that wherein we
yield, it be not against the truth, and we do not establish it: as we knovue
Paul did to the power off the priests, off the pharisees, and off the chief
off the synagogue. Th^^efore he thought it lavueful first to be tried off the
bishops, then also to suffer their pouver, though it were vnlauveffull if in
any thing it did not hinder the truth. But to be authorized of them, to be
sworn, toe subscribe, to be ordained and receive their licensing, he utterly
misl^ked and kept himself clear in those matters. How be it the bishopes
seals were gotten him by his brother, Which he both refused beffore the
officers, and being written for him vvuold not pay for them, and also being
afterward paid for by his brother, he lost one, and burnt an other in the
fire, and an other being sent him to Cambridge, he kept it by him, till in his
trouble it was delivered to a lustisse off peace, and so from him, as is
supposed, to the bishop off Norwich. Yet least his deali^g on this manner
should encourage others to deal in worse manner, he openly preached against
the calling and authorizing of preachers by bishops, and spoke it offten also
openly in Cambrige, that he taught among them not as caring for, or leaning
upon the bishopes authority, but one lie to s^ti^fie his duty and
conscience. And this his duty he said was, first to discharg his message
before God, and deserve no reproof of them, and then also, either toe find
them vvorthie, or else, if they refused such reformation, as the Lord did
now call for, to leave them, as his duty did bi^d hi^ For he did not take
charg^ off them, as he often gave them warning, and also did oft^n sh^vve the
cause, namely for that he ^avve the parishes in such spiritual bond^ge, that
Who soever Would take charge ^ff them, must also come into that bondage With
them Therefore he fi^d^^g ^he p^^^sh^s to^ much addicted, and pliabl^ to that
lamentable st^te, he ^u^ged, that the king^om off God Was not to be b^g^^ by
whole pa^^shes, but ^a^h^r off he vv^r^hie^^, Were the^ neu^^ ^o ^^^ve. For it
is as a g^a^^e off ^^ster see^, ^a^e^h ^h^ist, at the fir^^, M^t. 13. and as a
little l^au^^ hiddin three pe^kes of mea^e. So h^ h^^ing ^ri^d about half a
ye^re, both by op^n pr^a^hi^g, and by da^ ^e exhortation in sundri^ h^use, that
^ther bie bon^a^e (...), o^ o^ the Colleg^^s, or of vvi^k^d ministers and rea^
(...) to like of that bondage, no redress could be Wa^^ed for, h^ k^^vv^ that
the Lord had appointed him theree to be occupied, one lie to try and prepare
him to a further, and more effectual message, and to be a witness of that
woeful state of Cambrige, whereinto those wicked prelates and doctors of
divinity have brought it. This he foresavve before he preached among the^ and
therefore when they gathered him a stipend, and would have had him take
charge, he ref^sed, and did both send back the money they would have given
him, and also gave them warning of his departure. So he continued preaching a
while, till he fell soar si^ke: and in his sickness while he ceased his
labor, he was forbidden to preach bie a letter sh^vved him from the counsel
For in deed he had dealt boul llie in his duty, and provoked the enemies. The
bishops officer named Bancraft, did read the letter before him, but he nothing
moved there with did answer, that if he had taken charge in that place, he
vvoulde no vvhitt less cease preaching for that, but as he Was he took not
on hi^ he said, though the letter Were not, to preach there any longer.

OF R. B. COMING TO NORWICH and how the company there ^oined together.
After these things, When he Was recovered of his sickness, and had gotten
his strength he took counsel still and had no rest, What he might do for the
name and kingdom of God. He often complained of these eu^ll days and With
many tears sought Where to find the righteous, Which glorified God, With
whom he might live and re^o^se together, that they putt away abominations.

While he thus Was careful, and besought the Lord to shevue him more comfort
of his kingdom and church, then he savue in Cambrige, he remembered some in
Norfolk, Whom he hard say were very forvvard. Therefore he examined the
matter, and thought it his duty to take his voyage to them First because he
considered, that if there were, not only faults but also open and
abominable wickedness, in any parish or company, and they would not or could
not redress them, but were held in bondage, bie antichristian power, as
were those parishes in Camb^ige by the bishops, then every true christian
was to leave such parishes, and to seek the church of God wheresoever. For
where open wickedness is incurable, and popish prelates do reign vphouldig
the same, there is not the church and Kingdom of God* as it is written, 2.
Chro 1^. 4. for a long season, I^rael has been without the true God, and
without priest to teach, and without law. So that though there be a name of
priests, and of preaching, and of God amongst any, yet if there be set over
them idol shepherdes, popish prelates, and hireling preachers worse then they,
that vphoulde antichristian abominatio^s, there God does not reign in his
kingdom, nether are they his church, nether is there his word of message. For
no man can serve tvvoe contrary masters, says Christ. Mat 6. nether can
they be the Lords people without his staff of beutie and bands. Zac. 11. 7.
that is, without the Lords government. For his covenant is disanulled as it
follovveth in the 10 verse. Now his government and scepter ca^ not be there,
where much open wickedness is i^cu^^ble. For if open wickedness must needs be
suff^red, it is suffered in those which are without. as Paul says what
have I to do to judge those which are without?. 1. Cor. 5. 12

And again he says even of these latter times, that men shall be lovers of
them selves, covetous, boasters, proud, cursed speakers, disobedient to
patents, vntha^ckfull, ^n holy, without natural affection, truce breakers,
false accusers, intemperate, feirce, dispifers of the^ which are good,
traiters, headie, highmided, lovers of pleasures, more then lovers of God,
haueing ^ shevve of godliness, but having denied the power there of. From such
we mu^^ turn away as Paul vv^rneth 2. Tim. 3. 5. that is, we must count
them none of the church and leave them, whether in all these, or in some of
them, theie be openly so faulty, as that they be incurable. Also if any be
forced by laws, penalties, and persecution, as in those pa^ishes, to ^o^ne
with any such persons, either in the sacraments, or in the service and
worship of God, they ought utterly to forsake the^, and avoid such
wickedness. For the abomination is set up, antichrist is got into his throne,
and who ought to abide it. Yea who ought not to ^eeke from sea to sea* and
From land to land as it is written, Amos* 8. 12. to have the word and the
sacraments better ministered, and his service and worship in better manner. So
while he thought on these things, and was purposed to try also in Norfolk
the Forvuardnes of the people, it fell out that R. H. one whom he pirtlie vuas
acquainted vuith before, ca^e to Cambridge What vuas his purpose in coming, and
hovue he thought to have entered the ministry, and did use some means to that
end, it is needles to rehearse* only this I shev^^ that he seemed to be very
careful in that matter, and though he leaned to much upon me^ for that matter,
as upon M. Greneham, M. Robardes and others, and vuas careful amiss for the
bishops authorizing* yet his mind and purpose might be judged to be good, and
no othervuise but vuell did R. B judge of him. When he had ^alcked vuith R. B.
and shevued him the matter vuhereaboute he vuent, he received this ansvuere at
his hands, that it vuas vnlau^^full to use either master Greenhams help, or
any man's else for the bishops authorizing. So he shevued him hovue before he
had dealt concerning the bishop, and vuas novue so far from seeking license,
ordainig or authorizing at his hands, that though he never had the^, yet for
that he k^evue of them, he abhorred such trash and pollutions, as the marckes
and poison of Antichrist Notvuithstanding he said that if his conscience led
him, to deal as before ^e had dealt, he vuould do for him vuhat he might. For
he had before requested his help. But R. H. either chau^ging his mind, or
disappointed of his purpose, returned to Norwich, Vuhether also a short time
after R. B. took his journey. He came to R H*. house, Vuhoe then Vu^s Master
in the Hospital at Nor Which. He there finding room enough, and R. H.
VVillingee. nough that he should abide Vuith him, agreed for his board, and
kept in his house. They often had tal^ke together, of the lamentable abuses,
dilorders, and sins, Vuich no VVeraigne every Vuhere. At the first they
agreed Vuell together, but yet so as that in some things R. H. doubted:
notVVithstanding he came on more and more and at last Wholy yielded to the
truth, When he sauue it began to prevail and prosper.

THE TALK AND COUNSEL WHICH R. B and R H. had together, about matters of the
church and Kingdom of God.
Their commoning about such matters Vuas much and often, as of the state of the
church wherein it was then: and What was both their duties to do in such
matters. Their talck did fall out much after this manner. For When they were
vvalcking alone R B. said I was glad M. H. that God did keep you at Cambrige,
at your last being there, and disposed your way not to have any meddling With
those bishops, but to give them over. Whereto R. H. ansvvered, that he asked it
off God, and God hard his prayer, that if it was not meet for him so to enter
the ministry, he would let and disappoint him off his purpose. Then after
this at sundry ti^es, there grevve other tal^k: as of the Lordsh^p, offices
and discipline off Antichrist in stead of the Lordship and government of
Christ. Then fell out these questions between them, Whether those preachers
that submitt them selves unto such popish power, or any Way so iustefie or
tolerate it, as lavvefull in some part, or partly to be liked and used, can
the^ selves be liked off, or do their duty as lavuefull pastors and
preachers. Hereat R. H. did stick, because off M. Robardes, M. More, M.
Deering, and others, whom he the^ ^^d greatly like off. But more he doubted
and as it were drew back, when he should give over such preachers, or else
forsake and sh^incke from our own good purpose. For he would have the
consent of such preachers in the matters that were determined, and also vuould
have them to io^ne, though it was made plain unto him, that they nether
Vvoulde, nether could join, taking that course Which they did. And as for
chan^ging of their course there Was no hope or likelihood, that they Would do
it. For their living, their glory, and credit With the people, stood on it:
and they had sought out many fetches, and got an eue^ way on both sides.
They have their tolerations, mitigations, and other trim distinctio^s, as of
things partly lavvefull and partly vnlavvefull, necessary and less
needful, matters of faith and matters besides faith, ordinary and
extraordinary, with a number such like. Thus they both please the people, and
the bishops also: and so are praised and mantained bie the people, and also
suffered off the bishops, because forsooth they are somevvhat conformable. Then
from this talek they fell into other, namely of the parishes, guided either bie
such preachers, or by the bishopes and their officers. Off this it did
follow, that if the guides and their guiding Was vnlavvefull then also the
parishes so guided Were vnlavueful, and so could not be the churches of God.
For they that sh^t up the kingdom of heaven before men, Mat. 23. 13. can not
belong to the Lord, no more can they, to whom it is manifestly shat up
because they follov^e and praise such guides. This being thus it Was debated,
What profi^ ^hei had bie the preachers, and what good they had reaped bie the
pa^ishes: as whether faith might be wrought bie their preaching, and men
called to goodness, and what use there was off the blind reading off service
and the chapters bie the ministers. Then they both told how faieth Was first
Vvrough and bred in the^. But herein they agreed not, because R. H. said that
says might be bred and f^r^t wrought in some, only bie reading the
scriptures* and R. B. said, no. For though it might be nou^ished and increased
bie such reading yet the first Vvorcking thereof, is by hearing the word
preached: as Paul says, Romans 10. 14. how shall We bele^e on him on Whom
We have not hard, and how shall We hear Without a preacher. And least
reading should be taken for preaching, it is said, how shall they preach
except they be sent. So also least hearing the Word, should be taken for
hearing it read, Paul says afterward, that faith comes by hearing and
hearing by the word of God: meaning by the Word of God the Word of^ message
in his mouth whom God sends. So then faith is not Wrought by reading,
nether by that hi^ (...) but by (...) th^^ is, (...) can come. (...) was on
(...) the (...) faith, and (...) of the spirit (...) as (...) the (...) and
faith (...) be as we know not says h^ the reason of the vvind, ho^^, fr^^
vvhense, and vv^^ther it blovveth, no more can we casl^^ know, h^^ve a man
is bo^^ off ^h^ sp^it of God: that is how he is first renewed and called to
goodness by faith, and the spirit of God For this is the ^ifference of faith and
the sp^^it, because the spirit is an (...) Working off the h^l^ ghost in our
hearts, Which st^reth and prepa^^^^ us unto all goodness, and (...) faith comes,
it (...) th^s much more in goodness. B^t faith is a conscience of our redemption
and happiness in Christ, where b^evve (...) in ^ll nevvnes of life. So then
faith can not be excert ^^e he so renewed, that no open gro^^^ Wickedness be
in us: as James teach^th us, that faith Without VVoreks is dead. Iam. 2, 17,
10 and that We are but vain men (...) We say We have faith When We have
no Worckes. And faith may be vvhol^e Wanting for a time, till the Lord do call
us, and dravve us unto him* but the spirit is given to the elect even Vvh^le
the^ are infantes. And this spirit, though for a time it may be hidden and
covered, yet can it not clean be put out and q^enshed. Th^rfore by it We are
said to be sealed off God, and it is called in the scripture, the earnest off
the spirit, the earnest off our inheritance. 2. Cor. 1, 25. Ephesians. 1, 13, 14.
Whereb^e is meant that that spirit shall never Vvhol^ cease so Vvorck little or
much tovvard our salvation. Noe more can it be that faith being once thorovve^e
Wrought should Wholy fa^le, as Christ says, he that comes to me shall not
h^nger and be thatt believes in me shall never thirst. Ioh 6. 35. For though
the^ sin never so greuous^^e, yet ^ff they be elect, her have (...) some
conscience of their Vvelfare in Christ, or forevvaining of some grace which is
toward them. They had f^rth^r this talck* how men are called now a
days: how some are troubled in conscience: What (...) of the ha^^ there is:
and What tokens and assurance there is of our salvation. All which matters
(...) p^rtie did apply to him self. Therefore for our calling and how faith
is wrought now a days, it Was said before to be bie the preaching of the
word, b^t b^e what and whose preaching, that remaneth to ^nevve: for that
also was skanned between them. R B. was of this judgment, that every
Christian having faith and knowledge, and speaking the word of God unto
others, might vvinn others* This R. H. consirmedd ^a^ (...) found it true,
because bie h^s means ce^ta^ne sisters off his, when he taught and ex^^^ted
them, were called and vvonne. But h^vve far they and others were Vvo^^e, it
is afterward declared. Now (...) be thus vvonne, how is faith said to be
Vvro^ght by preachi^g of the word. B^saied that preaching is not oneli the
public teaching in the pu^pit, but it is rather that duty of speaking and
teaching the truth, as it ought to be taught and that in what place so ever.
For so it is Written in Deuteronomy. 6, ^. where parents are commanded to teach
the word, yea to beat it into their children and to vv^et them on therein,
both ^^^ing in the house, and as they vvalek b^e the way, and When the^ly
down, and vvh^n they ^se up Therefore prea^hing is not tied to the p^l^it,

preacher, when they took (...) an^ (...) Vntoe ^im the doctrine of the
ghospel more plainly. A^^ 1^, 26. Yet is there a difference of preaching,
because some ar^ called and received to that off^^e and charge, in public
manner, but others are bound only as all other c^ristians, to edify and
instruct one an other^ and th^s also i^ preaching, but not with publiqu^

that woman of (...), Io^ 4, 41* For whose words many b^leued, b^t (...)
the text, (...) the Words of Christ him self. For they confessed pl^nly th^^
he was the Christ the ^auiour of the world. And if the Words of all
christians ought to be such, as may minister grace to the hearers, says Paul
Ephesians 4. then if some hear vvh^^^ yet have not F^^th, they may also h^^e that
grace of faith Wrought in them by their hearing. Thus was it agreed on that
faith comes bie hearing and hearing b^e the word preached, and the word is
preached bie those which are sent, and this sending is both of those which
have public message and authority over others, and also of every christian*
vvh^ch is called and commanded (...) all occasions to edify others. For
where ^vvoe or three are gathered in mie name says Christ, there am (...) the

therefore can doubt, but that one or tvvoe mai^ win others to the Lord, and

WHAT GOOD THE PVBLICK PREACHING DOES now a days in England.
But this matter was not wholy agreed on What good was done by the
preachers and what fruict follovved their doctrine. For R. H. made great
accountes of some preachers, and said that much good was done by them. Whereto
it was ansvvered, that some preachers while they were forvvard, and did
(...) for reformation, so, long they did good* but When they ^^^^ted, and
fell to mitigitions and tolerating, they, did not so much good before, but th^n
they did tvvile so (...). ^uen as the Scribes and ^^harises vvhi^h compassed
s^a and land, to make one o^ them pros^ssion, and when he was made, they made
him (...) fould mo^^ the child of h^ll, then they themselves. M^t. 23. So these
when they were gone a little forvvard, and had brought others after them, they
then turned aside, and made their followers more careless of goodness then ever
they Were, yea and not only careless, but also dispightfull and most bitter
persecuters, if any went beyond the, or were more tovveard then th^i
Therefore well may that vvo in Mat. 23 13. be pronounced against such evil
preachers* because they sh^t up the kingdom of heaven before men, for they them
selves go not in, n^ther suffer they those that would enter, to come in. Woe
to them hypocrites, which say they desire reformation and yet they them
selves are most unreformed. They sai they mourn and pray for amendment, and
behold they are fed of the rich and Vpheld bie great men, they live in
pleasure and have courtly honor, and no man is the better but all are worse
and worse. Yea others also do rightly learn their hypocrisy: for as they
will streine and make much a do at some things, as at the capp and the
surplisse and crossing in baptism etc. and so will shev^e their zeal and
devotion in smaller things, and let greater ouerpasse: so also their
followers Will seem godly, yea touched in heart and humbled, yet are they
openly defiled with grievous offenses and wickedness. So have they a shevve of
godliness, as Paul says, but have denied the power thereof. 2. Tim. 3. 5.

HOW AND WHEREFORE THE COMPANY left the preachers and their followers: and
of the ignorance and sin in the preachers and people.
But because R. H. named such and such often times, which he said, feared God,
and were sorouefull for their sins, it Was made plain unto him both bie
word and vvriting, that he had small cause to say so. First for the
preachers, though R. B. did judge the best of some, as of M. Robardes, M. Moare
and some others, whose dealing at the first he did not thoroughly know, yet
afterward be found them to be like their fellows, and from them he said
plainly that wickedness went forth into all the land. lere. 23. Their
ignorance and vvretched dealing was often declared: as how they being
teachers of others are the^ selves untaught, even in some grounds of religion,
and in the chief parts of their callings. Th^^ will afterward appear as
likewise their foolish distinctio^s and shiftinges, which they have parthe
invented them selves, and parthe taken from others, that as it were an other
Antichrist is begotten* borne and made strong off them, and a nevve persecution
practissed. They Vvilfully tolerate the things Which are against Christ* yea
and with persecution and outrage vphoulde them, and how then are they ^ot
against Christ, that is how are they not antichrists? And these things
against Christ, are not only lamentable wants among them, but also mo^^
grievous wickedness and horrible abominations. Therefore both to R. H. and to
the company that aftervva^d joined, were such things spoken as follow, and
also set down in Vvriting: namely that we are to forsake and deny all
ungodliness and vvi^ked fellovveship, and to refuse all ungodly communion with
Wicked persons. For this is it that is most and first of all needful: because
God vvil receive none to communion and covenant With him, Which as yet are at
one with the Wicked, or do openly them selves transgress his
commandments. Novue it was shevued the^, that the foundation of that state,
is the popes canon law: the head stones in the building, is the power and
authority of canon officers, and that therefore they could not join with
them, as in one spiritual building. For so is it written Ezr. 4. 2. 3.
lik^vvise other scriptures were alleged to this end, as Ezr. 6, 21. Act. 2,
40. Ephe. ^. 3. Romans 16, 17 Ioh 10, 5 2 Thessalonians. 3, 14. 2 Cor. 6, 17. But
because the enemies sought it out deeply, hovue to justify all such
antichristian offices he taught them herein also to take heed of their leaven.
For th^^ b^ing for their vvar^ant the Qu^enes commaun^ement. She appointed
them say they, and they are not novue antichristian but civil orders, and if
you Will not have them to be callinges in the church, yet let them be offi^es
in the common Wealth. For ansvuere hereof it Was said, that in deed in the
parlaments, the bishopes had set down their traditions and orders, and the
Queen With the Counsel did agree and grant unto them. But such traditions,
except they were Warranted bie the Word off God, are but the precepts and
doctrine off ^en. And the scripture says plainly, Ho^. 5. 11. that Israel is
oppressed and broken in judgment, because he Willingl^ vvalcked affter the
commandment: that is, because men's commandments Were so much made off, and
the Will off the Lord not regarded. Therefore says the Lord in Esa 29, 13.
because this people come near unto me with their mouths, and honor me with
their lips, but have removed their heart ffrom me, and their f^eare tovvard me
is taught by the precept off men, therefore the wisdoms off the wise men
shall perish, and the understanding off the prudent shall be hid. Therefore
though they be nobles or bishopes, or vuho so ever, yet if they reject the
law off the Lord, for their own traditions, what wisdom is in them? Now
whereas they mingle civil and church offices, it was ansvvered by the word
off God that such mingling was flatt antichristianitie. For Christ him self
refused to be a ciuiliudge and diuider of lands. Luc 12, 14. and forbad his
apostles to meddle in such manner. Luc. 22, 25. Again it is written, no man
that goes on warfare, intangleth him self with the affairs of this life.
2. Tim. 2, 4. For if once ecclesiastical persons, as they call them, get civil
offices, they become that second beast which is antichrist Revel. 13, 15. For
they get the image off the first beast, which is the power and authority off
wicked magistrates, that confirm their authority: so they give a spirit to
the image, that it should speak, that is their church laws and orders,
having got civil power, both to deceive men b^ sh^vve of religion, and to
force them with threats and penalties, the kingdom of^ antichrist does
mightily vvorck and lift up it self. But because they again did strive that
they were protestants, and did but as the martyrs had done before them. They
had sought the Lord sense the time of the martyrs: It was ansvuered that so
said the adversaries of Judah and benjamin, and added further that they had
sacrificed a long time unto the true god, Ezr. 4, 2. as these also sai, they
have the word and the sacame^tes. So said the scribes and phraises, which
builded the tombs of the prophets, and garnished the sepul^heres of the
righteous, Mat. 23. 29, as these also have written and make much of the book
of martyrs, and say, if they hadd been in the days of their fathers, they
would not have been partners with the^ in the blood of the martyrs. But now
sense the Lord has called unto the^* and they refuse to be reformed in so
many and grievous pollutions, and also pursue, imprison and persecute those
which call for redress, even all the blood of the righteous shed upon the
earth until this day shall come upon them. Again whereas they underprop
wickedness by regard off times, or examples, of authorities: first for their
times, it was thus ansvvered, as it is in Hagg 1, 2. This people say, the
time is not yet come to build the Lords house: but is it time for you says
the Lord to dvv^ll in your seiled houses, and this house ly vva^^ and again in
Esa. 5^, 6. ^ have set vva^chmen upon thy vvalis Oserusile^. which all the day
and ^^ the night co^tinuall^^ shall not cease: ye that are ^in of ^ll or the
Lord keep not sil nce, and give him no rest, till he repair, and v^til he set
up ^erusalem the praise of the vvo^ld. ^lso for their examples and authorities
of men, it Was ansvuered as in E^od. 23, 2 tho^ sh^l^ not follow a multi^u
^e to do evil* But further they alleged the scripture for the^ selves: as
where it is written of Paul ^. Cor. 3 If ^ man buil (...) st^bble, and this
his vvorck ^ur^e, be shall lose, but he shall be safe him self: likewise th^^
sai, that they may build though ^^perfectlie, and yet help fo^vvard the house
of God. An^ ^gaine they a ^^ that Paul reio^^ed ^f Christ was preached, though
it were of ^unie and ^^^fe. Phil. ^. Thus by (...) sh^ft ^ges and exc^les,
they h^de as in a nest their ^ato vva^^nes and (...). T^ei (...) v^^estle such
pa^king^, and let them stee when they list, and ag^i^e they can co^er them by
such deep devises. For when Paul speaks of building hai^ and st^bble, he
rebukes their va^^e ^heto^^ck and cloquence, and this he says shall burn
vv^th the fire, but they shall be safe, i^ the^ cease to be va^^, and buil ^
rightly upon the foundation* wherefore for ansvuere of the enemies, ^^ was
said, that if Christ the foundation were vvanting how should either the
builder him self be safe, or his vvorck stand and abide* Fat Christ is the
foundation being duel^ preached and duly received, and so held. 1. Cor. 3. 11.
B^t none can hold him which open^^ sh^vv them s^^ues to be the children of
b^lial. And such are they vvh^ch ca^l so man^e gross corrupt^o^^, to be that
haie and stubble laid upon the foundation. For thus do they justify their
popish kind of parish^s which though they ouerthroe the true planted churches
yet forsooth they are b^^lt upon Christ the foundation. Behold their vvortlue
building* it is made of stravves, the b^ames be stubble, and the vvalss be hai
and vv^thered grass: naitathe^ those their v^^e and popish dec^ees and
traditions, are ^he sy^evves, and veins of that mo^ster A^^christ^ their
concl^^tous and laws made in popish ^onuocations likevvi^e their yearl^
in^unctio^s made to persecute the forvvardest, be the blood and marro^ or
rather the strength and po^^son of that monsle. Their stinted service is a
popish beadro^^ full of vain rep^ticions as if ^eauen paternosters did please
the Lord better then sy^: and as if the ^^^ttering of a pie or a parate were
much more the better, because it is much more the^ enough. Their tossing to and
fro of psalms and sente^^es, is like tenisse pla^e vvhereto God is called a
ludg^ who can do best and be most g^llant in his vvo^shipp* as bie organs,
solfaing, p^^cksong chaut^^g, b^ssing and mumling very roundly, on diverse
hands. Th^s they have a shevve of religion* but in deed they turn it to
gaming, and plai^ mockholidaie with the vvorsh^p of God. For the minister and
people are b^^dled like horses and every thing appointed unto them like
pupp^es: as to hear, tead, ansvue^, k^ele, sit, stand, beginn, break of, and
that by number, measure, and course, and only after ^ne order of antichrist.
The^ whole ser^^ce is broken, d^^ordered, catched, taken out of the mass
book, and a dum and ^^le min^sterie manteined thereb^e yea a va^^e vvorsh^p
without knovvelege and feeling.

And what difference is there between pr^^ng on b^^des, and the ^umbling up
of so many Lords pra^ers, so man^e bab^inges b^e the priest, and so ^^a^^e
an^vueres by the cla^k and people? For no part of the service must be left out
by the bishops ^^unctions.

Against such prayers, was the company also strengthened bie the word of God.
first because they are redd, and not applied to the word preached: which is
ag^^n^t the custom. ^F the church under the o^^ ^lavve: and also sense the
co^^ng of Christ. For When the s^crifices With prayer and ^^en: Were offered:
the Word a^^o Was preached. Therefore it ^s W^^tten in Eccles^as^^. 4. 7 Take
^eed to thy foot* When thou entrest in^^ the house off God* and be more (...)
to h^^re, th^n to grue the sacrifice off ffoo^es: for th^i know not that th^i
do evil. So then to babble ^uer prayers, When the people ^^ now not nether
are taught their sins, is an ^^ommation. Proue^^. 15, 8. and 21, 27. And to
seu^r the offices off the pastor, Which God b^th ^ined, it is iniquity. For
to preach, to pray, and minister the sac^aments, are so put tog^th^r in the
scriptures, that in the pastor d^d prai or minister the s^c^amentes, be Was
also to preach, as it is Written Deuteronomy. 33. ^0. Likewise in Ma^ac. 2* 6 7. Also
the Apostles did not publiqueli prai and minister the sacraments, except the
Word Were preached vvithall. Act 2. 42. Act. 10. 3^. Act 6 4. Also because
such prayers are off custom^ and course, they can not be With true feeling and
touch off heart. Therefore in vain they Vvorsh^p me, says the Lord, because
they come near unto me With their mo^thes, and honor me with their ^^pes,
but have ^enoued their heart from me. Esa. 29, 13 Now then ^ff it be the
offi^e off the pastor and preacher, and part off his calling, toe pray, then
must he be able off him self to do it: Wh^e then should a service, or reading
off prayers be stinted unto him? For if his lips keep not knowledge Malac.
2. 7. if he can not min^ster the vvo^d With prayer: Act. 6, 4. he is not meet
to be a pastor or vvatch m^^ouer the people. But whereas the prayers are set
devvne by number and course, it is altogether a popish superstition, or rather
an heathnish folly. For to What purpose are such fond repeticions, and vain
babli^g*s forbidden bie Christ Mat. 6, 7 And if all things ought to be done
in due order 1. Cor. 14, 40. Col. 2, 5. then where is that order in so chief
a thing as is the vvo^ship off God? Suerlie such a seru^^e and worship off God
is to build upon the foundation, as he that builds a dunghill upon the
sands, and when the tempest off vengeance shall come, it shall take him
aware, With the dong^e he has gathered. But they object that a le^tu^gie
may be appointed and red, and that most off their service is good, and the
rest, if any be evil may be left of them that hear, though the minister
must needs read it all. To this it was ansvvered, that it is a shame for them
to come into such bondage as either to suffer the incense of Nadab and Ab^h^
(for such is their service and abstractes from the mass^booke) Leuit, 10, 1. or
else to be servants to men to hinder their I bertie: which is forbidden 1.
Cor. 7, 23. 2. Cor. 11, 20. For bie the capp and the surplisse and the bishops
dischargings, with other their traditions, the Word is in bondage, and
likewise their Worshipping off God ^ie such stinted service, so that they can
nether pray, nor preach as they should, but as it pleases the bishopes.

Nether let them account off the feeling, which some say they have when they
hear the service red. For even in vvo shipping Idols, there is a strong
feeling, or ^a: her a strong delusion: and though there might be good motions
in an evil thing, yet that did not vvariant the evil, no more then Paul's
zeal did justify his persecuting of the saints: nor the tear^s vvhi^h come
from a troubled heart do iust^fie the ^inne for the which it is troubled. And
What is it to Vveep before an Idol, or to sh^d tears in a false and ^aine
vvorshipp? And what should they boast of some good prayers and some good
words which are in their common service? For witches and coniurers will
Use good words and good prayers, vvhe they conjure and charm the devil. And
whi halt they betvuene good and evil? For if they do many things well and
yet in one thing be open and grievous transgressors, all is made naught. And
how should any thing be partli good as they sai, and partli evil? For the
evil that is does make it vvholi evil, as it is written, Iam. 2. 10. 2. Sam.
15, 23. So then such traditions and orders, are so far from building upon
Christ the foundation, as the Lords house and temple can not be the synagogue
of satan, nor his builders the open and knovve^ balamits and masters of
iniquity. For Balaam blessed Israel but counseled to make an agreement and
partakeing together of Israel and amalek: So these do bless the cause, and
prai for discipline, but they tolerat and dispense with abominations, to make
Christ and belial agree. Yea sai they, Paul teacheh us to preach Christ by all
manner of ways, Phil. 1. and also reioiseth there i^. So th^i vvil preach
Christ after the manner of Balaam: and as by their prayers they hold still the
mediation and intercession of antichrist, so by their tolerating and dispensing
with wickedness, they hold st^ll his priesthood, and by their counsel,
decrees and traditions, they hold still his propbecie. Wheref^ore, to answer
them, it was said, that Paul re^o^sed, not that Balamits should be preachers
in the church, but that abundance of all sorts of preachers should be, so they
vve^e lavuefull. And though they Were hypocrites, and had their envy and
strife, yet that fo^thvvith did not make them vnlavueful preachers. For if they
brast not forth into open contention, toe make a division, nor did vvilfulli
tolerate open abuses, nor frovaroli justify false doctrine and heresies, Paul
Would not reject them. But if it Were otherwise, Paul is so far from
reioising in them, that he Wishes they were even cut of^ which disquiet the
church. Galat. 5. and again he says, that he shall bear h^s condemnation,
who so ever he be that troubles them. And to the Romans 16, 17. be says,
now I besee^h you brethren, mar^k the^ diligently which cause divisions and
offenses, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them. And
if Paul re^oised in all manner of preaching, whi do not they re^oise in the
Pope and in the frears and monckes For they would preach Christ, and v^ithall
the laws and traditions of antichrist: as these also will seem to preach
Christ, and yet preach a toleration of the ki^gdom of antichrist: as of the
power of lordlib shops, of their sending forth of Warrants, of sitting in
civil judgment, off imprisoning and persecuting in shamful manner: likewise
off their spiritual courts and officers, which ouerrule, threaten,
excommunicate, and poule the people with force and penalties. In deed Would
Paul reioise in such preachers, which allow and teach others to allow, or
vvilfulli tolerate that their profane babtisme with godfathers and godmothers,
With crossing and confirming off children, and other foolish tounges. off
these it was said, that they being superst^ous ceremonies, are not one lie the
precepts of men, and so make vain the vvo^sh^p of God. Mat. 15. but also are
popish superstitions and ^ miserable yoke laid upon us by antichrist. For by
them, and other such like, is the word of God made of none authority Ma^k. 7.
13. because his message by his servants is stopped, except they yield and
subscribe to such trash. Yet the word commands, that we should not be
servants to men, 1. Cor. 7. 23. that is they must lose no whit of their
liberty which they have in Christ. And this liberty they have, not to do
any thing affter men's traditions, but only to do what the Lord commands.
Therefore to teach and tolerate the ch^r^hing of vveomen was shevved to be
vnlavvefull: because they are churched, which either can be none of the church
and people of God, or else which never were put out of the church: and why
then should they be so solemnly again received to the church? For the levvish
vveomen were solemnly pur^fied, because of their outvvard uncleanness: but that
being then but a ceremony, can not be now held without great superstition.
And why should there be an open tha^ckesgeueing for that which is no
blessi^g, but a curse? For at their travail, and while they are in childbed,
it is known well enough what vanity is among them. So from their cursed
life at home they come to the church to have the priests blessing, and the
vvoeman is safely delivered to live the more wickedly. As for the babtisme of
the child, if it be rightly done, and either of the parents be godl^e, that is
a blessing, and in the publik sacrament there should be a publik thanksegeuing.
But the churching of vveomen can be no sacrame^^: nether is their bodelie
deliverance a public blessing: nai rather it is a curse if they be
vnthankf^ll and wicked. Therefore for their private blessing let them priuatlie
give tha^ckes. But if they be vntha^ckfull, why should the church meet
together to be thanckfull for the or why should the^ b^ hono^ed to that manner
and strengthened in their sin, while they are so vainlie comforted for their
bodelie deliverance? For how profanelie is that 91 psalm. applied to ^omfort
them, as if that p^i^ate and worldly blessing were all in all? or as if for
that worldly blessing there should be open meetings, and none for the
spiritual and greater blessings A for a man to teach his hous^hould, to reb^ke
sin in his friend, to acknouledge his fa^lt to his neighbor With amendment
thereoff etc. these are spiritual blessings, and if for these particularly
there can not be p^blique meetings, because that were a troubleso^e disorder,
why then should there be a d^sordered meeting for the churching of vveomen?
But as in this point, so in many such like popish delusions, the pomp,
superstition, and vanity of antichrist was shevved* as in their fa^^inges,
feastinges, saints euens, holy days, funerals, manner of marriing, popish
^ttire, with other such like. Further it was declared how ungodly the
bishops do auth^^ise, and the preachers do suffer and tolerate those vvretched
blind ministers to minster the sacraments, and sare service, and also dispense
with the people to hear them, and to receive the sacraments of the^. Also
how vvickedlie they allow those vvoefull conuocations of bish^ps in stead
of church lyno^es, and pu^t their university degrees, disputations, and common
places in stead of church prophecy, and despite and gainsaie the true exercise
thereof. L^kevvise sundry other wants in the church and vvoefull defaultes of
the preachers were sh^vved, the disproofe vvherof is now to long to rehearse:
as in how vile and abominable ma^^er they are made preachers and ministers.
They give their necks to the yoke of disordered and popish attire, the marckes
of antichrist, as the horned capp, the maidenlie surplsse, the g^^ue and
flo^^shing ^ppe^, the hoodes, g^unes, ch^me^s, rochets, coapes etc. and that
according to vain degrees: as for the lordly b^sh^ps, their attire, and for
the doctors, bachelars of divinity, ministers and priests, their att^^^: all
vvh^ch is more vain and ridiculous then the pharisaical phylacte^^es and
fringes. For the f^^nges were commanded bie the law but yet of them
supe^stitio^sly abused. But these their garments, and also their offices, are
flat against the law, and yet of them most proudly abused. As chiefly when
the Beadle and the t^pstaff^ do go before them to bring them into the pulpitt.
How sh^^efull^e do th^i ^a^e for the magistrates as if they hindered and
let them to do their full (...). How lik^ hireling^ do they leave the
^^ock when the bishops o^ the magestrats do unjustly discharge th^^ and hang
their authority and calling on their sleue, but vvil ^ot hold it of the Lord
their God? How parcial are they, could, and servile in suffering grievous
corr^ptio^s to the overthrow off religion and government? What running^ make
they from town to town, to preach for their prais, and leave their flock
destitute a long time for their pleasure, and to seck more gain and honor?
How do they sever preaching from governing, doctrine from discipline, as if
they could be severed and were parts divided? How many non residents are
there and gredie d^uourers off benefices, s^ipendes and other popish livings,
Which are utterly vnlavvefull, because they are bie tythings, which are now
no more to be given to the ministry, or bi^ laws and customs which hinder
the due placing and displacing off minist^rs, and the right and liberty off
the church therein. These and a thousand mo abominations have they amongst the^
and confess t^^m selves, that they can not redress them. So th^i hold one
communion with hoggs and dogs, eu^n open ungodly persons, and have no
remedy. Behold, do these men preach Christ, vvh^ch thus do p^ruert the
ghospel of Christ? For this is the sum of the gospel, and of Paul's
preaching, as he him self vvittnesseth, Act. 20. R^pentance toward God* and
faieth toward our Lord Jesus Christ. This repentance and faith is d^nied and
^o also Christ and his ghospel is cast under foot, where such grievous
corruptions do reign and nether his government and prophecy can ouersee and
try out such f^lth^nes, nor make separation of-cleane and vncleanne, not yet
by his preisthood any such ^ncleannes can be cleansed away Therefore we say
that these men can not preach Christ truly, but only in ^h^vve, nether can
build upon Christ the foundation* for it is not for you said the lords people,
but for us to build the house unto our god. for we our selves together will
build it unto the lord god of Israel. Therefore not all builders or preachers
are to be received or rejoiced in, but such as in deed do hold the foundation
and preach Christ aright. for the envy and strife vvhereof^ Paul speaks,
was seacret, or when it appeared, yet it could not and was not menifestlye
proved, and therefore such preachinge was not against the foundation, But if
any do vv^l fully and presumptuouslye stand in any open sin, ^de same can
not hold the foundation* for whether the sin be small or great, Mat. 18. if
it become open and be duly brought be fore the church, and the offe^der will
not hear the church, let him be unto the, faieth Christ, as an heathen man and
a publican. and again it is written, that that man which shall do
presumptuouslie, against the voice of the high priest) which figured the
voice of Christ Jesus at this day in his chuch, that man shall die. dut. 17.
And Saul king of Israel, though he said he had sinned, yet because he excused
it and repented not, Samuel would not return to him, till agaie^ he had said
I have sinned without excuse. 1. Sam. 1^. So that plainly it appears, that
Samuel Judged Saul not to hold the foundation, while he openly excused his
sinne^ for else he would not hau^ forsaken his fellovvshipp and left him to
the shame of the people But Semuels words before do plainly de^lare that all
open sin unrepented and stoud in, is the overthrow of the foundation* for
Rebellion is as the sin of vvitch craft, and transgres from is wickedness and
Idolatry. verse. 23. if then witches and Idolaterrs hold not the foundacio^
suerli noe more do they, which by ane sin reb^ll and transgress against
god and vvittingli^ excuse it, as did Saul or vvil^fullie and presumptu^^^l^e
Justify it. Now let it be Judged, hov ^ther they build upon the foundation,
or hold (...) ^^undacion, or preach Christ as they sai they do* for this is
to lay the foundation Acts. 8. 12. to preach the thengs that concren
th^-kingdome of God, and the na^^ of Jesus Christ. and this is to overthrow
the fou^dacion, which vvilfullie they or with persecution and outrage. they
vphould the abominations of a contrary kingdom. This is to lay the
foundacio^, Mat 28. to preach and Babtise in the name of the Faster teachinge
to observe and do, what so ever says Christ, I have commanded you. and
th^s is to overthrow the foundation to teach a toleration and practissing of
things, which a^e co^traie to the whole government and kingdom of Christ.
Now to hold the foundacio^, is to believe, and also receive that doctrine of
Christ in profession and practice of life. for as soon as they believed they
were babtised says the text* they continued in the apotles doctrine,
fellowship and co^mun^o^ of pra^ers and sacram^ts Act. ^. yea they sh^vved
their. works and their love, and the singlenes of their hearts verse. 46. Act.
19. and were seprat from that froward generation. and it is written that if
a^ie man shall break of the least commaundeme^ts, and teach men so, that is
shall do it openly and ge^e evil example, and hold and Iust^fie it in
doctraine and words, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of God, Mat.
5. that is h^ shall be excludede and sh^t out off ^is kingdom. And if any man
shall ad or diminish of the word of God, either by doctrine or by practisse,
and that vvitingli and stubburnlie, he can not hold the foundation for Go^
shall add unto hi^ the plagues that are written. Revel. 22. Pro. 30. Therefore
s^ie noe more, ye wicked preachers, that ye hold the fou^dacion, or that ye
preach* for what is it vvorth to say unto Christ, hail King of the Jews,
and bow the knee be fore him, vvh^ you cast your filthy disorders and popish
government as dougne on his face you have not yet gathered the people from the
Popish parishes and wicked fellovvsh^p. nether ^aue planted the church by
layinge the foundation thereof. ^or here by is the foundation ^ried, when We
make and hold the covenant with the Lord to be under h^s government. when
we have the power of the Lord, as it is written, Cor. 1. 5. amongst us, and
the s^pter of Christ Jesus amongst us. But these do hold the vvhep and the
svvord of Popish excomu^ication. They are without the Lords covenant, and
without his government, They have altogether. corrupted their ways, they
have broken the yoke and Burste the bands in sunder. for even those which can
be none of Christ church, abidnge in such wickedness, are chief in their
churches. and so far are they from bu^ldinge of gould and tymbere, together
with hay and stubble, that they put fire to the better timber and tu^ble
down the better stones to ouerth^vve the Lords buildinge. Thus have they an
answer of those places, of the. 1. Phil and. 1* Cor. 3. which is this that
^hir vvi^kednes and abominacion is more grievous then that can be counted the
Infirmity of speaking toe eloquently, or of envy which is secrett, or of a
con^e^tious mind.

THE ORDER AGREED ON FOR THE GIVDING and establishing of the company in all
Godliness, and such like This doctrine before being shevved to the company, and
openly preached a mong them
^^uie did agree th^reto. and though much trouble and persecution did follow,
yet some did cleave fast to the truth but some F^ll avv^i^. ^^o when trial
by pu^suites, losses, and imprisonment ca^e, and further increa^ed (...)
Robert* B^rker, N^colas vvo^^ovves, Tats^l, Bond and so^e others, for sooke us
also and h^l^ ba^k, ^ were afraied at the first There was a day appointed,
and an order taken, ffo^ ^edr^sse off ^h^ former ab^ses, and for cleaning to
the Lord ^^ greater obedience ^o a covenant was made and there mutual consent
was given to ^ould to gether

There were certain ^h^ef po^ntes proved unto them by the scriptures, all
which being particul^lie rehearsed unto them vv^^h exhortation, the^ agreed
upon them, and pronounced their agreement to each thing p^^ti^ularl^^, s^iing, to
this vv^ g^ue our consent. First therefore they give their consent, to ^oine
them selves to the Lord, in one covenant and fellovvesh^pp tog^^her, and to
keep and seek agreement under his laws and government: and therefore did
v^terlie flee and a^oide such like disorders, and wickedness, as was mentioned
before. Further they agreed off th^se which should tea^h them, and vvatch for
the salvation of their souls, whom they allowed and did chose as able and
meet ffor that charge. For they had sufficient trial and testimony thereoff
by that which they hard and savve by them, and had received of others. So they
prayed for their vvatchfulnes and diligence, and promised their obedience

Likewise an order was agreed on ffor their meetinges together, ffor their
exercises therein, as for prayer, thanckes giving, reading of the scriptures,
for exhortation and ed^f^ing, either by all men which ^^d the gift or by those
which had a special charge before others. And for the lavvefulnes off putting
forth questions, to learn the truth, as if any thing seemed doubtful and
hard, to req^ire some to shevve it more plainly, or for any to shevve it him
self and to cause the rest to understand it. Fu^th^r for noting o^t ^nie
special matter of edifiing at the meeting or for ^alcki^g severally thereon,
with some particulars, ^ff ^one ^i^ require public audience, or if no
vvaightier and more necessary matter were ^a^^^led of others. Again it was
agreed that any might protest, appeal, complain, exhort, disput^, repro^e
etc. as he bad occasion, but yet in due order, which Was the^ also declared.
Also that al should further the kingdom off God in them selves, and especially
in their charge and hous^hould, if they bad any, or in their freindes and
companions and whosoever Was Vvorthie. Furthermore they particularly agreed
off the manner, how to Vvatch to disorders, and reform abuses, and for
assembling the company, for teaching priuatlie, and for warning and rebukeing
both privately and openly, for appointing public humbling in more rare
judgments, and publ^k thankesgeuing in stranger blessings, for gathering
and testifiing voices in debating matters, and propounding them in the name off
the rest that agree, for an order of chosing teachers, guides, and releeuers,
when they want, for separating clean from unclean, for receiving any into
the fellovveship, for prese^ting the daily success of the church, and the
wants thereof, for seeking to other ch^rches to have their help, being better
reformed, or to bring them to reformation, for taking an order that none
contend openly, no^ persecute, nor trouble disorderedly, nor bring false
doctrine, nor evil cause after once or twice Warning or rebuke.

Thus all things were handled, set in order, and agreed on to the comfort off
all, and so the matter wrought and prospered by the good hand of God. But
last of all was this thing determi^ed, Wh^^h^r God did call them to leave
their contrie, and to depart out of England.

^ome had decre^d i^ to be gone into Scotland, and by vvriting, sending, and
ridi^g to and froe di^ labor in the matter, and seemed to b^ ^eluouse lea^^
their counsel should not take place. B^^ R. B. being ^he^ he^^ as prisoner a^
London, did s^nd down his answer bie vvriti^g to he co^tr^r^e For he ^u^^e^
(...) i^ was against du^tie, and ^o vvrote unto them* if ^hei first sh^^^^
agree^^g (...) Sco^l^n^ (...) as yet they had not ^^f^ed v^h^th^r they were to
l^aue ^^gl^nd. Also (...) unto them, that they were to do that good in England
vv^i^h possibly they ^ight ^o (...) ought not to remove, before they had yet
further testified the truth and the Lord had with ^^rong hand delivered them
from th^se. And ^a^h^r in deed vvoul^ h^ have it to be a deliverance by the
Lord, then a covveardly fleei^g off be^^ own d^u^si^g F^^^h^^ (...) them his
reasons, v^hy Scotland could not be meet for them, seeing it f^a^ed it s^lff^ in
those matters to please England toe much. We ^nevve also that we could not
there be suffered, (...) because some corrupt^o^ should come upon us from their
pa^^shes, which we ough^ to avoid, o^ because we there should have great
trouble wrought us from E^gland, as if we kept still in England. So when
some were better advised they changed their minds for going into Scotland.
Notvvihstandi^g again they would be gone into G^rsey or Garnsey and had the
consent as they said of diverse others, that ^ho^ght it meet they should learn
the state off those contries. R. B. said he was not against their going to
that purpose But yet he told them there was no such have to be gone out of
England, and that further delay and deliberation should be had in that matter.
But at last, when diverse of them were again imprisoned, and the rest in
great trouble and bondage out of prison, they all agreed, and were f^llie
persuaded that the Lord did call the out of England.

OF THE BREACH AND DIVISION which fell amongst the company.
But we come to the breach and falling out of these parties. First the laws
were broken, whereby the church of Christ should be k^pt in good order. There
fell out questions, offenses; and taking of parts, as we know it has
alvvaies and shall come to pass in the church of God. But for remedy of such
things the Lords ordinance was rejected and greater presumption further
increased, as shall appear. The minds in a manner of all were estraunged
from the pastor, or their consciencies vvou^ded, and they disquieted by foolish
doubts, accusations, slanders and quarrels moved and cast abroad bie the
chief est of them. Yet was there noething in controversy which was not
generalie agreed on by all at the first, and openly debated with mutual
consent, though diverse afterward fell away, and some also secretly were at
variance in their hearts. For the end did declare their hypocrisy and what
enu^e and grudg lay hidd in their breasts. Notvvithstanding their disposition
was perceived of some, and some stirring and disquietnes they began to make
was stopped and cut of for the tim^ But when the pastor f^ll sick and could
not be present at the exercises, nor visit them priuatlie in houses, the
stirring did freshly beginn again. They made a do secretly and tal^ked many
matters among them selves, but never ^ould them to the pastor, nor asked
counsel for them of the church by admonish^e^^, doubt, o^ question in
prophecy, before they had troubled the whole church about them. Hereby the
contention grevve so far, that some f^ll from questions to e^ill speeches and
slanders, and from slanders to open def^aunce and railinge^.

The matters in controversy were many, all which, though ^h^i v^ere often
times thorovvlie d^bated, yet therein were soo^e perverted them selves, and
did also corrupt and h^^^ others the stirring and business was after this
manner. There were fundrie meetings procured against R. B. By. R. H. and his
Partkers. for certain tales and slanders were brought. to R. H. vvhi^h he
stra^ght way received, and (...) against R. B. The accusations in the first
mietting^ Were, that R B. condemned his Sister Allen^ as a reprobate. also he
said* she had not repen^^^ of her abominations in England also that he said,
except she repented of her abomiati^^^ that night she should never enter into
the kingdom of God, to these it was a^svvered and vvitnesses taken first that
he nether did call nor Judge his sister for a reprobate, and that he had to
hastlie harckned to tales, in that matter, also witness ^^me in that he said
not to his sister, she had not at all repented of these abominations in
England, But that nether she not we all were sufficiently mortified, for them
for these matters, because R. B* did first priuatli rebuke R. H* as for that he
bid believed and received such things with out all proof and vvitnesses: and
also for that he said he knevv more aganst him, but would not speak of them
he took the matter very h^inouslie Straight vvsy he went forth, and sent
others to admonish R. B. for he could not so suffer the matter to pass, but
he cast of that charge which he had taken upon him, a little before, and would
not meddle any further, except there were some remidie procured. Then did he
put forth his, accusation in writing, which was red and received of others,
but not shevved to the party whom he accused for this vvriting and handling
of matters so privily he was blamed. and therefore when R. B sent unto him
to see the writing he refused, and kept it back* then he procured Chatles
mo^ema^, John Cha^ler, Tobie hen^on, and others to meet about the matter. at
which meeting because diverse things before were disorderedlie handled, R. B.
did then in^^antlie call for au order, that thnges might be rightly debated.
as first that noe accusation might be openly brought against him without
tvvoe or three vvittnesses, for this he said was the word of God, 1. Tim. 5.
19. Deuteronomy. 19. 1^. But R. H. which before had dealt without vvittnesses, did
this shift of the matte^, that he Needed noe vvittnesses to accuse R. B.
Because the mrtters could not bedenied, vvherevvith he ch^rged him, Answer
was made that they had been denied. and were not yet proved and therefore
such dealing was vtterli ungodly, Then in tvvoe other things did Robert. B.
call vppo the^ for ane order amongst them the first was that their might be
no fused brablinge But that the accuser and ansvverer having both told their
tales, then matters might be judged by the church, and they not suffered to
make contention, by gainsaing on an other so offt as they list. But herein
also did R. H. Charles Mu^nema^, and their partakers both deny and break
o^der contrary to the scripture alleged ^. Cor. 14. ver, 33, and. 1. Cor. 11.
So likewise did they in the other point which was that R. B. would have
one matter first and then an other to be debated and Judged, and not one
accusation, to pass, before the truteth thereof were thorovvli fou^^ out
the^e things were denied him, and could not be grannted, because of the
frovvardnes and contention of some then did R. B. co^pla^ne that he had great
injury do^^ him, and would depart from the meetinge if they proced in that
ma^ne^: which words when they hard, they were furthr out of order, so
that eihter twice or thrice he was forced to ^ys up and leave them th^^ was
he cond^mned as an vnlavvfvll Pastor, and it was said unto him that he was
not to keep the exercises* also that he was to c^^^^sse his faults before they
would Io^ne With ^^, the meeting being ^^ R. B chamber, he ^a^^ in ag^i^ and
^ould the^, that he was vnvvillinge thi^ should vees their meetings in his
chamber after that manner. So afterward they held their meetings in another
place: where again they condemned R. B. but nor as before ffor he sent unto
them, that they would send him in vvitinge the matters vvherevvith they
charged him, and dele in that manner against him, But the former slanndres they
h^d thou given over, and had got up three new matters against him, which then
sent him avvai one was that Robert B. with his vvittneses had falsely
accused R H. of Notable appare^t wickedness, to this it was ansVvred, that he
nether had taken Vvittnes nor made accosation in any matter save o^lie that in
defense off him self he h^d called for vvittn^s to clear hi^ self, as that
when the adversary did accuse him without vvittnes* l^kevvise h^ rebukedd
To. H. off open wickedness, and when he made that also a public accusation, he
was feign op^li to sh^vv wherein he was wicked* namely in that be openly
b^ake the order and government of the church in that he had receued false
accusations, and report against his brother, and him self also did falsely.
accuse him and trouble the church in that manner: en other accusation Was,
about the pavvning off a silver spoone, wherein R. B. was condemned as an
unlawful surmiser. But straight way they were found by their own
vvittnesses, to be wicked slannderers, and that ^. B. had just cause to
admonish one as beig cause off offense to her mother in that matter ^be third
accusation was, for Rebuking R. H. off murmuringe, and this vvrs Judged a
slander* thus when R. B. perceived how that diverse times privily, and now
also openli they cast him off, he also openli pronounced it, that he had noe
charge off them, if they so continued to withdraw them selves then did R.
H. took upon him charge. for his conscience he said could not suffer him, to
let them be without teachinge. yet afterward. belike their co^siencos did
trouble them for casting off Robe. Brov. in such order, So in an open meetinge
every on confessed their ffaultes. RoBe. H. both openly in the church and
particulerlie from man to man, and From house to house did acknowledge, that he
had dealt unadvisedly against R B. in sundry things. So in all things was
Robert Brown, cleared, and acknowledged noe ffaulte at all as being innocent
in those things where with they had charged him, But yet ffor all this the
grudge lay hid in the hearts of diverse* and new meetings were had against R.
B, where in again accusations were had without Vvittnesses, R, Har, again
received sundry tales and slanders and nethr shame which before came on him,
nor the Judgment of God by the death of his children, nor sundry warnings
otherwise could* cause him to lay dou^ his malice and troublesome mind. he had
diverse partakers that claue fast Unto him, because he Taught Them that They
might Lavvfully Return IN TO ENGLAND AND there have their dvvellinge, Their
DOCTRINE they liked Because they Were VVearied, of the hardness of that cont^^:
So And So did hold in With Robert, H. THEN WAS Robert. BROWN. the tbird*

Time condemned, and forsaken off Them

The faults They Laid Against him Were, For rebukinge, Rob, H, Sister of
Want of Love AND off abhorring The Pastar: Which They Counted A Slander.
Likewise FOR RE ^^king her, oF Ivdgeing VVrong Fully on The Printer, Which
Was also made a slannder But yet again after this rec^cilemet was made, and
the accusers confessed their ffaultes: ^^ no ffault as yet Was found and
proved agai^^t R. B. Thus agai^e the^ all took him for th^^r lav^^ full pastor
and made a faier show, that ^he^ would deal no more so ffool shly against
^i^. No^ vvithsta^ ^i^g such was their e^^^e, and stuma^k and d^fire to be

R B. to accuse^ trouble him a^ the meet^gs as b^ffore the^ had done very

vv^th him in publik prayer and th^k^gi^i^g being at o^ disagreme^t and not

And for that he charged son b^^sie bodies vvh^ch were also bla^ he^ers, not
to come^ the meetings, n^t^er to his c^^^er i^ that ma^^er, he was gr^no^sly
taken up and miscalled ^^ diverse. Likewise for h^s vv^fe there was much a

th^s latter a d^e R. H. was ^^ck and came not abroad^ bath h^d tale, c^ovve

and ^hale^g^^ for an here^ick, and condemned as vvo^se the^ the pope and

children must not be counted forth with, to be of ^^ church, with the pa^e^ts
believing and received to the church. Also because he said, that n^^ can be the
people of God, and ourvvardly so taken, which ethe^ did not offer and give up
