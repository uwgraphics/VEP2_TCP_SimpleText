Churchyardes farewell.
AS wit is never good
till it be dearly bought:
So friends until their truth be tried,
may pass for things of naught.
For freendship all in words,
a kind of flattringe is.
And if I think my woorthiest freende
may be abusde by this,
I ought in plain flat terms
to show him what I think,
And blaze the meaning of my mind
by paper, pen, and Ink.
Because the doors be barde,
where my good will should pas:
And buzzinge Bees do creep in place,
where Churcheyards credit was.
The fowlers merry pype
betraies the careless bird:
And fleeringe fawners lie in wait,
to geeue their friends a gyrde.
When fortune turns her face,
beware the Syrenes song:
Beware the busy Clawbackes fine
whose freendship lastes not long.
Think you the flies do flock
about the fleashe in vain?
Does not the Be seek out the flower
some honey there to gain?
Do courtiers all for love,
approach the princes gates?
Does plainness in these double days,
repair to great estates?
No sure in maskinge robes
goes mischief muffled now:
And subtle sleightes with snakish stings,
do lodge in smilinge browe.
And your affections blind,
has you bewitched so,
Ye have no power to find your friends,
nor to descerne your fo.
Ye fill the fleesinge fistes,
and let the needy lack:
And sharp their teeth whose crafty tungs
can byte behind your back.
I pray you tell me now,
if hap would let you slide,
How many would through thick and thin
for love with you abide?
Perhaps a heap of such
could hungry hangers on,
Whose nature geues the court a fygge
when worldly hap is gone.
Can you not see the cause,
that bringes them swarminge in?
And where the wheel of Fortune swayes,
the world favor win?
Had not your elders wise,
good trial of such trashe?
Did you not see what worthy wits
at length were left in lashe:
By trustinge some to far,
and heapinge hope in those
That seemed friends to outward sight,
and yet were secret foes?
O let me license have
to painte these pecocks out,
Whose feathers wauereth with the wind
and so turns tail about:
Yet flicker with their wings,
to faune the face awhile,
Until their sudden flight they take,
and so their friends beguile.
What should we judge of them,
that stare in faces still:
Where lo, for all their curtsie great,
they bear but small good will.
And where they seldom come,
but when some suit they have:
They make a sign to see my Lord,
yet seek by sleight to crave.
What makes them watch their hours,
and thrust in thickest priest.
It is for freendship that they bear
unto a certain lease.
My Lord must help to get,
now crowche and kneel they all:
Now stand they up like saints in shrine,
or nayld against a wall?
Now fig they here and there,
as thorns were in their heels
Now trudge about these whirlegigges,
as world did run on wheels.
Now cast they freendly looks,
all over the chambers gaye.
Now give they place as God were there,
now turn they every way.
Now talk they trim in printe,
and prate of Robin hood:
Much like the knights of Arthers court,
that knew full well their good.
Some through a finer mean,
do creep in credites lap:
And vale their bonettes by devise,
as favor followed cappe.
Such Iuglers bleare your eyes,
and smile within their sleeue:
When honor in his harmles mood
Does best of them believe.
Were you but once a day,
in simple servants place,
And like a looker on ye stood,
to pry upon this case:
Then should ye thoroughly see,
who plays the wily fox:
And how the Wolf can frame himself,
to draw in yoke like ox.
Then should the mufled men,
show forth their faces bare
And thereby noble hearts should learn
to know what flatterers are.
The glory of your state,
heaues up your head so hie:
That many things do escape your vewe,
which we see full with eye.
And who is now so bold,
that dare flat warninge give,
To such as in top of pomp,
or princely plasures live.
I muse what new found chance,
has so disguisde the state
That men often times for speaking plain,
do purchase endless hate.
Whilst fraud and fained cheer
does evil honor feed:
And noman dare a plaster give,
to heal the wound in deed:
Full fickle shall you walk,
and never want disease.
They should be banished from your court
that are so glad to please
With twittell twatlyng tales.
The truth like larm bell.
Should shortly sound in tender ears
and learn you to do well.
But sure the sweetest nuttes
do noorishe woormes apace,
And flatterers of the finest stamp,
in court have finest place.
I am to plain therefore,
my pen has drunk to much?
An alie head makes idle hand,
the quick to near to touch.
Nay, nay, some one must speak,
although the vice it be:
Or else the play were done ye wot,
then Lordinges pardon me.
For free of every Hance
I thank the gods I am,
And serves no turn but for a vice,
since first to court I came.
To make the Ladies laugh,
that leads the retchles lives
Who late, or never woodcocke like
at later Lammas thriues.
Yet if the fool had got,
at his departinge thence
A night cap, or a motley coat,
or else some spendinge pence.
It had been well enough:
but nothing there I found
For nothing from their budgets fell
they were so straightly bound.
Ye lie sir Daw in deed,
can thou so long be there
But needs must fall into thy hands,
some paringe of the pear?
A hungry paringe Lord
he has that there does weight:
He watches like a greedy hounde
that stands at receight:
That often for lack of g^me,
runs home his panche to fill
Or sterues in forest or in park,
at least at kepers will.
Look what to court he brought
it is consumed and gone
And there the fleash of every iointe,
is worn unto the bone.
The carraine crows of Cheap
in steyng bones so bare
Would clap the fell in counter too,
to breed him further care.
Nay fie on such good hap,
on Soldiers faith I swear:
To sell the Courts and City both,
and he that takes me there.
Let him cut of mine cares,
and slitte my nose aright
And make a curtoll of the beast,
that has a head so light.
To linger out my years
for moon shine in the well
A hood, a hood, for such a fool,
a babble and a bell.
A coxcombe is to good
for such a calfe I trow.
As of my Lord my leave I take,
so now again I go.
Where fortune shall assign,
my staff to light or fall.
And thus I know a truer freende,
was not among them all.
Then to my power I was,
to you and all your race
Nor unto whom I daily wish,
more bless hap and grace.
quod Churchyard.

FINIS.
