A LEGENDARIE, CONTAINING AN AMPLE DISCOVRSE OF THE life and behavior of
Charles Cardinal of Lorraine, and of his brethren, of the house of Guise.

Written in French by Francis de L'isle.

Imprinted. 1577.

Francis de L'isle unto the Reader.
THE most reverend Cardinal of Lorraine, friendly reader, did in his life time
long feed us with a vain hope of a view of the Legend of the life of his
brother the Duke of Guise, who was slain before Orleans, the which we have
with great devotion diligently waited for, in full assurance that among so many
learned men, as the said Cardinal had always at commandment, he would choose
out one of the quickest wit and capacity, who might frame some work worthy
the sight of our France, which long time has seen few devises pleasant unto
the eye, or delectable in the ear: We know also that the Cardinal was not
destitute of sufficient store of remembrances, requisite for the beautifying of
such a labor. But after much attendance, we finally have found our selves
frustrate of our expectation, through the deceasse of the said Cardinal, who
has left unto us the making of the Legendarie as well of his own person, as
also of the aforesaid Duke of Guise, and the rest of the brethren: whereby
diverse have been occasioned to think evil of this his said promise, and to
suppose that himself was fully resolved to feed them in hope, through doubt
least his flower pot should have been discovered, the filthiness and
abomination whereof, would have yielded him and al his progeny, most stinking
and abominable in the sight of our whole nation. Not wasting any longer time
therefore in the disputation, or arguing upon the causes which have moved him
thus to cast dust in our eyes, neither making any account of his lies and
glosings, it is requisite that my self should yield a reckoning of mine own
doings, and display the causes which have moved me to undertake to ease the
said Cardinals heirs (if so be he has any, for my self neither am, neither
will be counted in their number) of such their labors, as they should have
sustained by writing this Legende, comprehending the lives not only of the
Duke of Guise, and of the Cardinal of Lorraine, but also of all the rest of the
brethren, which nevertheless are not displayed at full, but only in part.

Some years therefore are passed; since that thinking upon the miserable
calamities of our France, which I did see daily to increase, not that I was so
blind, as not to behold how God being provoked through the iniquities of the
French Nation, did stretch forth his arm against them, yet marking with what
stones and weapons he endeavored to humble us and assuage our pride, I found
that the house of Guise, among others were as his chiefest instruments, whose
crafts and cruelties exercised over both great and small, and therefore already
published in sundry pamphlets, ought not still to lie scattered abroad, in
hazard of perishing in the pit of silence, or by being never detected unto the
posterity. This was therefore one of the causes, that moved me by little and
little to begin to search among my writings and papers, for some books and
remembrances correspondent unto such as the Cardinal in his life time made so
great account of, as to lay them for the most part upon his table, and then to
say, (as he did in the time of Francis the second, at an assembly of the
chiefest estates of the realm at Fontainebleau) that the same were the crowns
of his life which should yield him immortal: Out of the which I began to
collect certain places and notable matters, hopinge thereby somewhat to
assiste a certain friend of mine, who began happily with this piece of work:
But when he gave wholly over this labor to the intent the better to tend unto
things of greater importance, which one day I hope shall come to light, also
that the murders of S. Bartlemew so bloodily celebrated had even lighted in the
neck of their other driftes (for therein the said Lords of Guise were in manner
chief doers) I thought it not amiss to set forth before such as are thereof
ignorant, part of their life and manners, seeing that them selves do delight in
the continuation of the same, and that the wicked man must both hear and see
things which he would not, because himself commits such as he ought not.

Now am I so far of, through these remembrances collected here and there, (as
any who have read or perused such discourses as within these fiftene years
have been published, may at the first blush perceive) from restraining the
desires and pens of such as have in their hands other more large, ample, or
exact Legends of the race of the Guisians, that contrariwise I do most heartily
desire them no longer to defraude our France the common mother of us al, of
such remembrances and warnings as ought often to be set before her eyes, the
which the house of Guise both have, and yet do endeavor to pluck out of her
head, whereby them selves may afterward conduct and order al things after
their own pleasures and ambitious appetites.

Many times have I wondered at the dullness of diverse French men who otherwise
do profess but over much knowledge and understanding, and yet in the mean
time do seek to persuade us that whatsoever commodity we have, does proceed
only of these men, from whom in deed most of our inconveniences do arise:
For had not private affection bleared the eyes of their understanding, I dare
say they would be of an other mind, and that whenever it shall please God to
take out of their sight the looking glass of ambition, revenge, and such other
pretenses as do dazel their sight, themselves will willingly eschew and detest
that filthiness which now they do cherish and worship.

In respect of those who daily with me do behold these evils, them do I wish to
consider how or in what manner they may be able to procure any remedy
thereunto, and to the same earnestly to set their hands, as the law of Nature
binds them.

As for such matters as herein my self have entreated upon, at the first I
supposed I might have reduced into ten or twelve leaves of paper all that I
minded thereof to publish: but being once shipped I was suddenly carried away
into so marvelous a sea of affairs, that before that I can recover any haven,
I shall be constrained through innumerable rocks and perilous goulfes, to make a
long and tedious navigations: And as those who having once forsaken land, can
hardely in a great while recover the same, although both with oars and sails
they do what so lies in them, even so I being entered so far into this
Guisian sea, must and will now endeavor my self to come to as speedy a haven as
possibly I may, and yet after such manner as I hope your selves, though that I
take not land so soon as you would wish, will nevertheless hold me excused: For
the tractes and trauerses are so long and diverse, with so many waves one in an
others neck, and such contrariety of winds puffing and tossing the course of
my little bark diverse ways, that many times I am ready to begin again, and
do still find new occasions of further travail: howbeit with Gods help I
will recover land with all possible speed, setting before your eyes the rest
of this Legende.

The style is such as you see, namely simple and naked after the manner of
remembrances and collections. For, for the most part I am content to use only
the terms and phrases of such other writers as before me have delte herin:
and notwithstanding that I have set forth most of them at large, yet have I not
done it to the end to fill up paper, but only in respect that in my opinion
it seemed necessary for the explaning of such points as in that place were to
be handled. For I doubt not but that the time may come when we shall see a full
history, wherein these homely and simple beginnings or descriptions of the
deeds of the house of Guise shall be set forth in such terms as the matter
requires: and unto me it is enough if my rude and silly discourse may serve
some of our french men as a light wherewith to behold and feel the fire which
has already consumed many, and yet does overmuch smoke still in purpose to
wast the remnant, unless a mightier then man do take in hand to provide a
remedy.

It might be demanded wherefore I have so long deferred the bringing of this
into light: but I may answer that it is yet time enough, also that it were to
be wished that this Legend might be an ample discourse of all mischiefs fully
ended and past, whereby we should be exempt of all cause of fear in time to
come. But the spirit of the Cardinal of Lorraine lives still in France, nothing
desisting from all means to bring the estate into like stay as in his life
time he pretended, which in case many cannot comprehend or perceive, I would
be very glad if also in time they might not feel it unto their own
confusions. For my part I can not possibly betraye her of whom I do hold my
life, and therefore do begin to warn her of such fraudulent embushments as
are laid to devour her, under pretense of her maintenance, wherein I would
that my brethren and fellow countrymen should, (if they lust) reap the
commodity of my good will toward them, the which I mind more plainly to set
before their eyes, if God lend me life, not permitting any other to be more
affectionate to resist by lawful means the driftes and practices of foreyne
tyrants, then my self. And notwithstanding I have not so good opportunity so
to do as many others, yet will I so effectually endeavor it, that the tokens of
my good will shall not be to seek. I could have wished that I had some other
matter to deal in, nothing doubting but that all men do know that I were able
to write of other affairs, which indede is true: but I trust they can not
deny but that it is both time and labor well bestowed, when a man discloseth
unto the posterity, yea and to such as yet do live, such things as are most
necessary for their instruction.

Moreover in deducting of these matters, I have not prescribed unto any the end
whereunto he ought to apply them, neither what commodity he may reap by the
knowledge thereof, seeing that it will be easy for every one to comprehend the
same, considering also that both the things which be passed, and those which
are contained in this book, together with such as shall be disclosed in others
that shall follow, are so clear and evident unto al men, that I should even
do open wrong to their memory and judgment, if I should make any long
discourse thereupon. My only request therefore is, that it would please all
Frenchmen to call to mind their ancient generosity and liberty, and to
withstand al slavish bondage, whereinto through the factions of the Guisians
they have been drawn, who abusing the simplicity of our Kings, have reduced
the whole estate of our realm into such danger as al men may evidently
perceive.

I am no otherwise persuaded, but that diverse courtiers and servants of the
house of Guise in reading in this legendary such things as are written in
their own consciences, will shake their heads and bend their brows against
me, contrarying this thing or that thing, whom I am to request patiently to
bear with me, until they see the rest of the books which shall shortly
follow this, if God permit: For then peradventure they will power water into
their wine. Otherwise if they be desirous to publish any other Legendes in
their masters behalf, so that it be with better consciences then them selves
have served the^, I am therewithal very well content. But in case they seek to
wrong the truth, let them be assured that their flatteries and falshodes
shall be reueiled to all the world, to the end men may beware of them, and that
in time to come none may unwittingly be deceived.

The Cardinal had continually one principle in his mouth touching the
advancement of his enterprises, which was, that a lie faced out three hours, or
as many days at the least, was much worth, practicing therein the saying of an
ancient philosopher, which was, that a liar ought to be utterly deuoide of
shame: which rule his servants and partakers do still observe, thinking that in
stoutly denying the thing which is more manifest then even day light, the time
will wear away and for that most of them do little or nothing at all regard
any religion, it is not to be marueiled, though they tread under their feet
al equity and honesty, which are the two pillars and stays of man's life, so
that long to contend with them were but lost labor: wherefore we are to refer
them unto the judgment seat of almighty God, before whom they shall at length
appear, notwithstanding they endeavor to persuade both them selves and other
men of the contrary.

If any man ask me wherefore I do now publish but one book of this legend,
seeing that I have promised more in the title, I do in deed confess that I am
in possession of the remembrances of the whole work, but being surprised, and
as it were manieled with an inevitable let, and the printer also being
importunate to publish so much as I had already done, has wrested out of my
hands this first part, wherein finding any faults escaped through the said
printers negligence, I trust you will nevertheless excuse me, as wanting
opportunity to remain at his press, and leisure to write over again that
which I had but scribled before, hoping that the next books shall be better
corrected, also that if in any part of this book you miss any particular
matter, you shall find the same in some other more convenient place hereafter.
Howbeit if so be that such of the race of Guise as do remain, might obtain so
much favor of God as that it would please him to turn their hearts, so that
they would suffer our realm to be in quiet, and that contenting them selves
with that which is past, and so through courteous and faithful behauiours would
blot out the remembrance of their former mischiefs, I would be glad to break
promise, and would endeavor to be the first that should cast the remembrance
thereof into the pit of oblivion: but in continuing the race which hitherto
they have run, they shall find both brains and hands enough to resist the^.
And although that through crafts and treason they and their semblables have
hitherto, rather then by force of arms so highly adua^ced them selves, yet will
the truth in the end overcome and have his course, so that they shall get
nothing by following the steps of their auncesters, save only they shall
become so much the more odious both unto God and men. Yea they shall build
their pinnacle so high that finally it shall fall upon their own heads, and
ensnare them selves. If therefore they will prevent this danger, and assubiect
them selves unto their duty, it is the thing whereof I should be very glad:
neither can I deny but that the house of Guise containing them selves within
their limits, might have done good service to the crown of France: but of
servants seeking to become masters they have marred all, and overthrown both
themselves and others. Thus loath to be in this matter over tedious, I beseech
you friendly readers, to show a good countenance unto this first book, until
the coming forth of the rest which shortly shall be presented unto your view:
This do I assuredly trust that you will do, in case you be natural French men,
that is to say, affectionate unto the service of God, the commodity of your
country, and the conservation of your ancient and noble liberty.

Fare well.
THE LEGENDE of Charles Cardinal of Lorraine, and of his brethren, of the house
of Guise.
IN the year of our Lord 1362, The genealogy of the house of Guise.
after the deceasse of John Duke of Lorraine, succeeded his eldest son
Charles the first, who by Margaret daughter unto Robert of Bauieres, Countye
Palatine, had issue three sons, and as many daughters. The sons named
Charles, Robert and Federic dyed without issue: But of the daughters, the
eldest named Marie was married unto Enguerand Earl of Coucy, who also died
without heirs: The second called Katherine was given to James Marquise of
Baden, with the dowrye of three preuostshipps, namely S. Dier, Arches, and
Bruettes, besides a good sum of money, in consideration whereof, the said
Marquise renounced his whole title unto the succession in the Duchye of
Lorraine: The third daughter Isabell was married unto Rene of Anjou the son of
Jews of Anjou, the second son to John King of France. This Rene the first
succeeded his father in law Charles in the Duchye of Lorraine, seeking also
the possession of the Duchye of Bar, in the right of his mother Yoland of
Arragon: wherein Anthony Earl of Vaudemont, son of Ferry Duke Charles
brother withstood him, and challenged the said Duchye, whereunto he was assisted
by Philippe Duke of Burgundye, who was offended with the marriage of the said
Rene of Anjou unto Isabell of Lorraine. Hereupon in a conflicte near unto
Bulainuille, the said Rene was taken prisoner, and thence conveyed unto Dijon
under the custody of the Duke of Burgundye aforesaid, where he was detained
fifteen years at the petition of the Englishmen and Burgundions, under whom at
the same time Ferry of Vaudemont, son to this Earl Anthony, did serve:
howbeit finally it was agreed that Duke Rene the prisoner should give his
eldest daughter Yoland in marriage unto this Ferry of Vaudemont, with the sum
of two hundred thousand crowns in the name of a ransom. In the mean time
Jews of Anjou Duke Rene his eldest brother, intending the conquest of Naples,
whereof Pope Clemente had crowned him King, dyed without issue, whereof so
soon as Duke Rene was advertised, he purposed the possession of the same
Realm, but notwithstanding the aid of most states of Italy, as Genes, Milan
and other Potentates, he was by the Spanierdes finally expelled Naples, and
forced to retire into France unto his brother in law King Charles the seventh,
whereas after some war against the city of Metz, having knowledge of the
death of his wife Isabell, he resigned the whole government of Lorraine unto
his eldest son John, in full intent to live the rest of his time quietly
and peaceably within his dominions of Prouence and Anjou.

John surnamed of Calabre, after he had governed Lorraine eighteen years dyed,
leaving a son named John of Anjou, who in the time of his grandfather Rene
aforesaid, fianced Anne the daughter of King Jews the eleventh, albeit
afterward breaking of with his said father in law through the persuasions of
the Duke of Burgundye, and entending by repudiating the daughter of France, to
conclude a marriage with Marie the said Duke of Burgundyes daughter, being even
at the very point so to do, he dyed. By means whereof Rene the second of
that name, son of Ferrye of Vaudemont brother unto Duke Rene of Anjou, and of
Yoland sister unto Duke John, succeeded in the said Duchyes of Lorraine and Bar
in the year 1473. for want of other heirs, during the life of his grandfather
on the mothers side Rene of Anjou, and of his mother Yoland, whom the
inhabitants of the country would not accept for governor. This Duke waged
continual war against the Duke of Burgundye, whom finally he ouerthrewe
before Nancy, in whose time lived his great grandfather Rene of Anjou, termed
King of Sicill, who rested his old bones within his Duchyes of Prouence and
Anjou: him did King Jews the eleventh, greatly cherish and quietly
entertain, fearing his association with the Duke of Burgundye and the English
men, who greatly thereunto solicited him. This King Rene sent word to his
nephew Rene, that in case he intended to be his heir, he should wholly take
upon him the full arms of Anjou, which proffer he refused, well was he content
to quarter together the arms of Anjou, Sicill, Prouence, and Lorraine. howbeit
upon his other refusal, his grandfather King Rene instituted Charles Earl of
Maine his nephew by his brother Charles also Earl of Maine, for his inheritor,
whereof Rene being certifyed, he hasted toward his grandfather, but all being
done and past he returned back again in a great heat, and King Rene died in
the year 1482. Shortly after also dyed Charles of Maine his competitor, whereby
Jews the eleventh King of France, remained lord of the countries of Prouence,
Anjou, and Maine, by the gift of the last will of the said Charles, who also
left unto him the Duchye of Bar.

After the death of King Jews the eleventh, Rene of Lorraine, who through the
persuasion of Pope Sixtus was gone into Italy to seek the conquest of the
realms of Naples and Sicill, and there had continued in wages with the
Venitians a certain space, did now return into France, there to challenge his
right in the Countyes of Prouence and Anjou, with the Dutchye of Bar. This
Duchy was granted unto him, conditionally that he and his successors should
for the same do ho^mage unto the King of France, who thereby remained
sovereign lord over the same but as for the Countyes of Prouence and Anjou, it
was answered, that they being parcel of the demaynes of the crown, might not
fall unto the distaffe: so that finally by consent of King Charles the eight
and this Duke Rene, the controversy was referred unto the arbitrament of three
vmpiers, whiles in the mean time the King committed unto the Duke a regiment
of an hundred men of arms, with the enterteinment of six and thirty thousand
frankes of yerly pension. Now in the year of our Lord 1489, the Neopolitanes
detesting the tyranny of young Alphonsus, required the aid of this Duke Rene,
who thereunto prepared him self: but duringe his preparation, the three
vmpiers aforesaid pronounced their arreste, wherein it was found tha^ not only
Anjou and Prouence, but also Sicill and Naples did apperteine unto the King of
France, upon which occasion Charles the eight undertook that voyage him self.
Howbeit notwithstanding this arrest, Yoland mother unto this Duke Rene, even
after the deceasse of her father Rene the great, did still retain the title of
Queen of Sicill: yea this Rene the second challenged the title of King of
Sicill and Jerusalem in the name of the conquestes o^ his ancesters, causinge
his eldest son Anthony to be called Duke of Calabre, still quarteringe the
arms of Anjou with his own, for which his presumption, together with diverse
other his practices, King Jews the twelueth stomaking him, expelled him out
of France, and took away all his pensions: but he found means to be
reconciled, and afterward dyed as he rode on huntinge, having remained Duke
five and thirty years. This man had by his second wife named Philippe, the
sister unto the Duke of Guelderland, twelve children, of whom seven dyed in
their youth, whereby he left only five, who all were sons, named Anthony,
Claude, John, Jews and Francis.

Anthony succeeded his father in the Duchyes of Lorraine and Bar, also in the
Countye of Vaudemont and Marquisat of Ponte: and by the death of this Charles
Duke of Guelderlande his mothers brother, in the said Duchye of Guelderlande,
and in the Countye of Zutphan, leaving behind him three children: Francis who
succeeded in his dominions, Anne married unto the prince of Orange, and Nicolas,
first bishop of Verdun, and afterward of Metz, and finally (as presently he
is) earl of Vaudemont, and at this present father in law unto Henrye the third
King of France.

Francis the successor of his father Anthony, had by Christian the daughter
unto the King of Denmarck, issue, one son named Charles, and two daughters.

Charles the second, and son unto Francis, succeeded his father in the year
1545. and presently lives, having to wife Claude the daughter of King Henrye
the second by whom he has diverse children now living.

Claude, the second son of Rene Duke of Guise and Baron of Ginuille, repaired
unto the French court, where in short space he obtained the government of
Champagne and Burgundye, and marying Anthoynet of Bourbon aunt unto the late
King of Navarre he had by her, issue six sons, namely Francis, Charles,
Claude, Jews, Rene, and the great Prior of France: of whom, but especially of
Francis, who after his father was Duke of Guise, and finally slain by Poltrot
at the siege of Orleans, and of Charles afterward Cardinal of Lorraine, we will
hereafter speak more largelye, not omitting what so may be incident touching
the other brethren, of whom Claude obtained the Dutchye of Aumale, and was
slain at the siege of Rochel, Rene enjoyed the Marquisat of Allebeufe, Jews
was created Cardinal of Guise, and the youngest was made great Prior of France.

John the third son of Rene, and bishop of Metz, was through great suit unto
Leo the tenth elect Cardinal in the year 1518, and afterward being ordinarily
resident in the French court, obtained great favor with King Francis the
first, for he never meddled with matters of estate, but passed over his time in
pleasure.

The other two sons, namely Jews and Francis dyed in the wars, the one in
the realm of Naples, and the other at the battle of Pauie.

Duke Anthony the first son, was of a reasonable good disposition, and
voluntarily came unto Dijon unto King Francis, and there did him hommage for
the Duchye of Bar, showing him self very sorye for his offense which he had
committed in seeking to defraude the same King Francis of the Duchye of
Guelderlande, which he pretended to fall to him by succession in the right of
his mother. For he had practiced by one James Canis the Borowmaster of Nemegue,
to raise the commons, and keep the said King out of his possession: but then
seeing that the people would not accept him, but had submitted them selves unto
the Duke of Cleuelande, he fought all means possible to be reconciled, and to
cure this skarre, which through the help and favor of his brother John,
Cardinal of Lorraine, he soon brought to pass, and King Francis did clearly
pardon, and forgive him.

This Cardinal John was the iollyest encrocher of benefices alive, as might
plainly be perceived by the estate where into he brought the whole French
Church: but because he otherwise was of a reasonable courteous disposition, a
great spender, and therewithal very liberal, all was taken in meetly good
part.

The third brother who was Duke of Guise, and father unto this Duke of Guise
and Cardinal of Lorraine with the rest, was never put in any great credit,
neither had the charge of any weighty affairs committed unto him. For his
leading of the Kings power without his love or leave into Lorraine to the
succor of his brother Duke Anthony, who, as the talk went, was sore ouerlayed
with Anabaptists, was taken in very evil part, and him self (had not the
Constable at that time great master and Marshal of France entreated for him)
would King Francis have committed unto prison and hardely dealt withal: For
King Francis was such an one as would not permit those who without his own
liberality were of them selves of no reputation, so far to encroche upon his
authority, as appeared at another time, when the said Lord of Guise being
governor of Burgundye, sought to enter into the castle of Aussonne, which at
that time was a several charge, and in the custody of a french gentleman of
the retinewe of the Marquise of Rotelin, named the Lord of Rouueray, who
withstoode him and forbade him the entry therinto, which the said de Rouueray
durst not have done, in case the said Lord of Guise had been a prince, who for
that cause complained unto King Francis, but he for that deed greatly
commended the said gentleman, and laughed to scorn him, who undertook the
person of a prince of his blood. This Duke pinched to the quick, and did
extremely persecute diverse marchantes of the best towns of France, but finally
beginning with the merchants of Paris, who hitherto were not accustomed unto
the rasor, the whole city took upon them the matter, and caused his
commissions to be revoked, imprisoning some of his promoters, whereat the rest
vanished away like snow against the sun: for which cause he conceived so
grievous an hatred against the inhabitants thereof, that neither for dearth or
plenty, what abundance of corn, wine, or other victuals so ever there were
within the country of Champagne or Bourgundy, during his government of either
of them, the said city of Paris could ever come by any, either for money or
love without plenty of letters of mart, which were sweetly paid for and
dearly bought. howbeit by that means he never after durst deal with any
whole estate or communalty, not that he therefore quite quayled, but still
hauked after confiscations here and there, and so lightely met with one or
other: wherefore his whole rigourous force he executed over the inhabitants of
his own jurisdiction, whom he even flaied with all extremity, which was the
cause, that King Henry through his fathers advice, would never after commit
unto him any matter of weight, although his two eldest sons the Duke of Guise
and the Cardinal of Lorraine did bear great sway, for he was at that stay,
that co^ducting his children unto the court gate, he there left them, and so
returned back again, whereof I doubt whether the father or children ought
most to have been ashamed: Finally this man dyed through poison, and as became
a good Christian, pardoned those persons who mistaking him for an other, had
hastened the course of his days.

^e pre^ment of (...) house of ^ise.
His children did his brother Cardinal John advance, who seeing him self
furnished with many benefices, chose Charles to be his successor, whom a few
years he maintained in the college of Navarre, from whence he was preferred to
the government of the Dauphine. For although in France were no want of men
far more meet to undertake such a charge, and execute that function, yet did
the credit of his uncle John procure this favor at the hands of the great
King Francis, together with some tokens of his quick wit and capacity herein, al
which notwithstanding, during ye reign of the said great King Francis, they
were not of any estimation: For this Charles was simply named lord of Reims,
and his brother Francis, Earl of Aumale, their father being yet living, and
the rest of the brethren were forced to prefer and thrust the^ selves forward
with might and maine. Again, King Francis was not ignorant that these men might
stir up coals and procure some broiles, under pretense of the counties of
Prouence and Anjou, and so trouble the state, upon which causes he credited
them no further then needs he must. In deed he so highly honored the beauty
of their eldest sister, as that he permitted her at the entry of Queen
Eleanor to be attired, in Princess array, although afterward perceiving these
strangers to prevail as if they had already been Princes of France, he denied
the wife of the Marquise of Maine of the mantel royal. It is not also unknown
how the same King, toward his end made but small account of the Constable, who
therefore withdrew him self unto his own house, the chief occasion of which
displeasure arose of that, that through the commendation of the said Constable,
his son the Dauphine Henry had retained into his favor the said Lords of
Guise, the consequence whereof he doubted. Their allia^ce also unto the
daughter of the great Seneschal of Normandy, whom all that time the said
Dauphin kept, caused that the same King Francis who before had highly favored
her, did now also disdain and mislike her. This Lady who was called the great
Seneschal, was daughter unto the late lord of S. Valliers, and with her own
maydenhead redeemed her fathers life, but afterward to the great reproach and
slander of our France, after she was half spent, was given to the Dauphine
Henry, whose heart she so steadfastly won, as that finally she was created
Duchess of Valentinois, and in effect became Queen of France. Whereupon the
house of Guise accompting her as a convenient bridge, by the which they might
pass over into France, did think it meet to take hold of so good an
occasion, although it were in effect but an homely shift, and therefore
procured the marriage of their third brother, afterward Duke of Aumale, unto
the youngest daughter of this said Seneschal, by whose means, they the further
insinuated them selves into King Henry's favor, upon whom in the mean time
they practiced two several drifts, wherein we may as in a glass behold the
rest of their behauiours toward the estate of France.

First by means of this Seneschal they presumed so far, as to attempt to
wrest from the Dauphine Henry a promise of restoration unto the counties of
Prouence and Anjou, as part of a dowry toward this their brothers marriage:
Howbeit as God does for the most part, even by the simplest persons abate the
pride and cruelty of the mightiest, so likewise did he now cause the only
countenance of the Lord de la Chesnay to force the^ most shamefully, and even
as it were in despite of their hearts, to release this grant, being in this
only respect to be accounted happy, that through the throwing of the same into
the fire, they did also therewithal consume and reduce into ashes the assured
proof and manifest detection of their traiterous fellonie, considering that in
case King Francis had but once had any inckling of the same, it would have
been the utter extirpation and undoing not only of them selves, but of the
great Seneschal also.

Let us now therefore proceed unto the second point which was this. On the one
side King Francis not long before his deceasse was much accompanied with two
persons of whom he made great account: The one was the Cardinal of Tournon
chanceler of the order, and Master of his chapel: The other was the Lord
Annebaut Marshal and Admiral of France, and besides both these there was the
Constable also, who notwithstanding he came not to the court, yet did he
retain the office of great Master of France. On the other side the Dauphine
was entangled with the Lady great Seneschal, upon whom two of the brethren of
Guise did continually attend, namely Francis Earl of Aumale, and Charles Lord
of Reims because of the alliance aforesaid, al which notwithstanding, yet was
he most addicted unto the Lord of S. Andrews, whose father had been his
governor. Now then seeing that the sickness, whereof the late King Francis the
first died, was long and in most of the physicians opinions in manner incurable,
the Lords of Guise persuaded the aforesaid Dauphine that so sone as he had
gotten possession of the crown, he should set forth an edict, the contents
whereof were, that no man should from thence forth retain in his hands two
offices, by means of the which they promised unto them selves the spoil of
the noble men aforesaid, besides that under color thereof they might have free
access unto the handling of the whole estate, and so in time atteine unto
their aspiring drifts and purposes, and that the rather, because they perceived
none of the Princes of the blood over hasty to intrude them selves thereinto.

Howbeit now before we go any further, we have to consider two other notable
cha^ces which happened presently at the death of King Francis before named.
(...) Fran^ ^ateth ^ouse of ^e.
This King lying on his death bed, called for his son the Dauphine to the end
familiarly to talk with him. In which communication like as the soul
approaching unto his departure, is for the most part more free and deuoyde of
worldly cares, earthly burdens and al other transitory affairs, and so
consequently less tied unto the body, also that in manner al men in that
extremity, time and place do entreat upon more mystical and heavenly matter,
then before time they are wont, yea diverse through a certain prescience of
things to come, which surpasses man's natural understanding and reason, do
prognosticate of that that is most likely to happen: even so now among diverse
other aduertisements and notable instructions which this King gave unto his
son, one was, that he desired, yea and charged him not to deal with the
Children of Guise, neither to permit them to have any rule in the affairs of
the estate: For says he, I have manifestly perceived and am well assured that
the whole stock of the^ is naught, also that in case you transgress this my
precept, they are to strip you into your doublet and your subjects into their
shirtes. This admonition deserved both to be marked and put in excution, but
the simplicity of the Dauphine being bewitched by this Seneschal together with
Gods heavy displeasure against France, would not permit the child to follow
his fathers counsel, which in this case proved but over true, for his
affirming the whole race of them to be naught, did shortly after prove it
self certain. The same day that this great King Francis let his life at
Rambouillet, whereas the Dauphine for very sorrow and grief, seeing his father
lie in such extremity, and therewithal being in a manner overcome, was laid
down upon his wives bed, who the whiles sat upon the floor showing great
tokens of anguish and heaviness, the great Seneschal and the Duke of Guise who
yet was but Earl of Aumale walked there also, although contraryly affected,
for she was very pleasant and joyful, seeing the time of her triumph draw on,
and he still from time to time walked to the door to hearken after news, using
always at his return this phrase, Now the yonker goes his ways, but had not
that yonker, (seeing it pleased him so to term him) been, both he and the rest
of his whole family had been but simple underlings in Lorraine still.

But now to our former matter, let us mark the execution of the forenamed
edict, concerning retaining of sundry offices. The same being concluded upon,
and King Francis dead, (...) house ^uise do ^le the ^dinal of ^rnon.
was put in practice before it was either seen or published. For presently the
Lord of Reims displaced ye Cardinal of Tournon of his office of Chanceler of
the order, who in displeasure resigned to the^ his mastership of the chapel
also: The Admiral d' Annebaut lost his office of Marshalship: likewise now
therefore I will proceed to the Great Mastership, for the obteining whereof the
Guisians were importunate, moving King Henry to write unto the Constable that
before his coming to the court, he should by proxy resign one of his offices,
either the Co^stableship or else the great mastership, for they supposed that he
would still keep the Constableship as being of great auctority and credit. But
were it that the King was at that time determined to exempt his gossippe from
their ambition, or else that he sought through the others voluntary resignation
to co^ferre the said office unto the Marshal of S. Andrews, to whom he had
already broken his mind, to the end by such ordinary means to suppress some
part of the furious attemptes of the Earl of Aumale and his brother, or what
other occasion soever there were yet certain it is that he wrote to the said
Constable with all speed to repair to him, but not to resign any of his
estates, referring that unto their own private communication at their next
meeting. After his coming the King who before even burned with earnest zeal
and desire to see the said Constable, who so long had been absent out of his
sight, was now so far from taking from him any of his estates, that
contrariwise at their first embrasings he professed him self to be ashamed that
he had in his hands no office worthy his person, and therefore in respect of
such default, the more to honor his welco^ming, he yielded and presented unto
his said gossip his own person. Now the Lord of Reims had gotten the great
seal, and the Earl of Aumale had seized upon the keys of the castle, as a
seasine fallen to him even by succession: But hearing the King call to the one
to render the keys, and command the other to carry the seal unto the great
master, whereby they should be driven necessarily to sleep under the lock of
the said great Master, walk at the commandment of the Constable, and not in
any wise to deal in matters of estate without the said gossips permission, it
may be easy for each man to comprehend into what part the affections of these
brethren were bent: Seeing also at the same instant an other estate of Marshal
of France erected to the behoof of James of Albon lord of S. Andrews, which
was even the last office that remained in the Kings hands, upon the which as
upon his last refuge, the Earl of Aumale had fixed his whole hope and trust.

This therefore has been one of the fou^dations and roots of their quarrel
against the Constable and his progeny, Their gratitu^ toward Consta^
wherein besides their manifest injury offered unto their own persons, in
this respect, they have also showed them selves very unthankful toward the
said Constable: For it is not unknown unto all those, who duringe the reign
of the great King Francis had any dealings in matters of estate, that as well
the father as also the uncles of the said Lords of Guise, had never any more
assured or faithful friend in France then the said Constable, who long before
their coming into that country was already in great creditte and estimation
with his Prince, and afterward with incredible favor did succeed two great
masters of France, the one the Lord of Boisy his cousin german, the other the
Duke of Sauoy his Father in Law, and finally atteined unto the hiest degree
next under the Princes of the kings blood, that ever any man (of what estate,
country, or condition so ever he were) might clime unto in France. To him
only above al other (I say) is the whole generation of Guise bound and
beholding for their descent from a Princess of France and daughter of
Vendosme, because that he the said constable was the motioner of the marriage
between their father and mother, who already nothing hoping or once thinking
upon any so good hap, had begone to cast his eye toward another Lady of
far meaner estate and calling. Again, the only request and peticion of the
Constable were of sufficient force in their behalf, at the return of King
Francis out of Spain to keep free their father out of prison, for his leading
of the Kings power and forces into Lorraine without the said Kings love or
leave, yea, and to restore him again into favor. Again, after the deceasse of
the Kings daughter, who was Queen of Scots, and that the King of Scots was
desirous to take another wife in France, the Constable was the only preferrer
of the said Lords of Guises sister, the late Queen, mother unto Marie Stuard
how Queen, who by his means was preferred before many other both more
marriageable and meet for such a man then her self. Howbeit I can not deny
but that it was necessary to send her into places unknown, for that whiles
she remained at Nancy she endeavored to have forsaken the court of Lorraine,
and have yielded her person unto the Abbot of Beaulieu great uncle unto the late
Duke of Bouillon, yea had not the Countess of Lignanges warned the Lady Rene
of Bourbon of her determination, she had assuredly departed with the said Abbot
into his cloister of Beaulieu. For the which practice the before named Abbot was
rewarded with the natural courtesies of this race: for after that upon their
fidelities he had yielded him self into their claws, and that it seemed they
had forgotten the wantonness of their said sister, they procured his murder at
unawares, accompanying their cruelty both with perjury and great ingratitude:
For notwithstanding the house of Sedan has always stood the race of Lorraine
in great stead, yet have the Lords of Guise in diverse wise since persecuted
the same.

Now therefore to return unto their ingratitude toward the Constable. King
Henry the second coming unto the crown in the year 1546, and having, as is
aforesaid, committed the whole regiment thereof unto his good gossippe the
Constable, did shortly after take the Earl of Aumale, his brother the Lord of
Reims, and the Lords of Sedan and of S. Andrews, and present them unto the
said Constable with these words. Gossippe, these scholars do I give unto you,
to the end they may learn of you, and obey you as my self: I pray you train
them up in my affairs, so that under you during your life they may do me
service. And then turning unto them he said, I do give you this man for your
father and Scholemaster: him love and honor, doing whatsoever he shall command,
for my self do account him my father, and the most dear friend and faithful
servant which ever my father had, or my self may have.

Afterward the said Lords of Guises father at his next meeting with the
Constable said unto his sons. Behold your father, for my self has he also
created: him honor and serve, for we al be bound so to do.

The testimony also of ye late Cardinal their uncle, which he gave in the
presence of the Cardinal of Lenoncourt describes more plainly their duties
unto the Constable, for it was pronounced in his absence, and they practicing
some conspiracy against him. Take heed, said he, of displeasing that man, for
had not he been, both your father and whole kindred had had enough to do,
neither should your selves have ever atteined unto that estate wherein you are
now placed, nor your sister neither: even my self am in his debt for mine own
promotion, and for whatsoever favor, commodity or credit that I have reaped
at the hands of the late King. Al which admonitions were nevertheless not of
sufficient force to restrain them from practicing as well openly as privately
the overthrow of the said Constable, notwithstanding that so long as King
Henry lived, their driftes came but to small purpose, in deed during the
reign of Francis the second they were even with him, and paid for their
scholing, as hereafter more at large will appear.

The original of the malice of the Guisi^ns against ^he Admi^al of Chastillon.
We have already spoken of the marriage of their brother the Marquise of Maine
unto the great Seneschals daughter, which was the first root of their hatred
against the Lord of Chastillon, afterward Admiral of France, the which through
new occurrences has since so increased, that finally they have brought both
him and al his brethren unto their ends, not yet ceasing from practicing the
utter extirpation of al his race and family, unless them selves may first be
dispatched and made away. To begin therefore at the foundation of al these
evils, which since have almost subverted the whole estate of France: we are to
understand that the Constable seeking the preferme^t of his nephues, did about
eightene years since procure unto the eldest brother of the house of Chastillon
the degree of a Cardinal, which in that time through ignorance and
superstitious zeal was greatly desired among al estates, and afterward did by all convenient means advance as it were step by step the other two brethren
Jasper and Francis, into al commissions and offices of warfare both by sea and
land, by means whereof they having obtained great credit among the whole
nobility, it was an easy matter for the Admiral then but Lord of Chastillon,
as well through the support of his said uncle the Constable, as also in respect
of the debates and quarrels that then were prosecuted between the Lords of
Dampierre and S. Andrews, to insinuate him self into the especial favor of
King Henry then Dauphine. This the Earl of Aumale perceiving, who in those
days was in least reputation with King Francis, he thought it meet for the
atteining of the said Dauphines good will, to join in familiarity and straight
league with the said Lord of Chastillon, which familiarity each of them so
firmly observed for the space of four or five years, that these two Lords
could not live one without an other, but as a token of their more mutual
agreement, did for the most part apparel them selves daily in like suits of
raime^t. In the mean time it so fell out yt the father of these Lords of Guise,
purposing the preferment of his family by all means possible, sought to join
his third son the Marquise of Maine in marriage unto the youngest daughter of
the great Seneschal, the mother being as then the Dauphines harlot. Of this
marriage the Earl of Aumale could in no wise like, and for that cause fearing
to provoke the Dauphine against him self he brake the matter unto his
companion the Lord of Chastillon, desiring him, as his especial friend, to give
him some good counsel how he might herein behave him self, affirming, and
that even with tears, that whatsoever might happen, he could never give his
consent thereunto. The Lord of Chastillon seeking to comfort him, endeavored to
appease him, and after diverse debating of the matter between them, their
resolute determination was, that better were an inche of authority with
honor, then a whole fathom with shame. Howbeit after this resolution, the
Earl of Aumale did so far stray from following the advice wherein before he
had so obstinately persisted, that now to the end to displace the said Lord of
Chastillo^ out of al favor with the Dauphine, he showed the Marshal of Vieille
ville their common friend, how that he could hardly have believed that the Lord
of Chastillon had so envied his honor and advancement, as thus to have
encouraged him to withstand the aforesaid marriage. This therefore was one
occasion of their displeasure, of the rest we will speak more in place
convenient.

Through this marriage one of the brethren is now provided for, The practices of
the Duke of Guise for getting of a wife.
let us therefore proceed to the preferment of the rest. Duke Rene their
gra^dfather married Margaret the daughter and only heir of William Duke of
Tancaruille of the house of Harcourt in Normandy, by whom they do enjoy the
County d' Aumale, the Marquisate d' Albeufe and al other their possessions in
France, except Ginuille: But because this lady was crouchbacked and found
barren, he forsook her, and as is aforesaid, married the Duke of Guelderlands
sister, by whom he had issue the Duke Anthony, the Duke of Guise their father,
and the Cardinal John their uncle. Duke Anthony (as they pretend) was borne
during the life of his first wife, and left a son named Francis who was
father to Charles at this present Duke of Lorraine, whom at his decease he left
very young, as having scarce atteined the third year of his age. Then (as for
the most part it still chances, that widows and orphans are commonly
entangled in the snares of the wicked and covetous) the Earl of Aumale began
to bestirre him seeking to have found a door open into the Duchy, by
publishing Duke Anthony to be a bastard: But seeing that he could not well bring
his purpose to pass before he had gotten at the least one foot into the said
Duchy, he sought by all means possible the marriage of Christian the widow of
the late Duke Francis. Howbeit she being both wise and of good capacity,
according to the nature of a good mother entending the preservation and
maintenace both of the country and orphane, aspired unto the custody of the
one through the wardship of the other, and therefore kept this hasty wooer in
breath, who through her marriage assured him self of the same wardship, which
afterward might yield unto him a favorable and honest entrye unto the
possession of this desired Duchy. And therefore presently upon the marriage of
their brother the Marquise of Maine, al these Lords of Guise in triumphant wise
hasted into Lorraine there to put the widow in full possession of the wardship
of her son. But so sone as she had gotten her desired pray, she gave them a
rosemarie wipe, dismissing them and sending them away with fleas in their
ears, utterly disapointed of their purpose.

Having therefore thus missed of their intent against their cousin german,
(for the Duke of Lorraines father and they were brothers children) they cast
forth their nets to entrappe their other kinsefolke on the mother side, (for
likewise the King of Navarre and they were brothers and sisters children.) They
therefore endeavored to stop the marriage between Jane d' Albret princess of
Navarre and Anthony of Bourbon Duke of Vendosme afterward king of Navarre: But
as a widow standing in some need of their help, could closely despise them,
even so could a Kings daughter, who regarded not their aid, openly disdain
them: For (said she to King Henry who motioned the matter unto her) would you
my Lord wish that of her, who by duty ought even to carry up my train, I
should make my sister in Law? either that the daughter of the Duchess of
Valentinois should go cheek by ioule with me? with which answer the King
found him self satisfied, and therefore never communed any further with her in
that respect, which caused the Guisians from that time forward to bend their
whole driftes against him self, making him finally to pay for their marriage in
manner and form following.

Hercules d'Este Duke of Ferrara, had a daughter whom he loved better then his
own wife: For it is not unknown to all the world after what manner in her
life time he entreated the noble Lady Rene, the daughter of King Jews the
twelfth, commonly called ye father of the people: neither is any man who had to
deal in those days in matters of estate, ignorant upon what consideratio^s
she was denied unto so many noble persons who sued for her marriage, and then
finally placed in so base estate as was Ferrara. This Duke had I wot not what
share in certain poulders, boulets and munition, with such other like trash
which he had bestowed to his own behoof, and yet now sought to make our King
to pay for the same, which in the time of King Francis he could not do, for
he knew over well what iugling had therein been practiced against him. To be
brief, his right herein did this Duke give in marriage with his daughter, and
King Henry paid for it, whose lenity made them to way down to much on that
side, and boldly to undertake greater matters, whereunto they added yet an
other drifte, which was, that acco^modating themselves unto al kind of
pleasures, or delights correspondent unto the age of the King, they used him
as a foundered horse, or stale, over whom they might the farther cast their
sight. I need not here rehearse their infamous dealings, for the very walls,
beds and candlestickes of their house of Reims and other their Manours can
bear more then sufficient record thereof, in that they have (as we may say)
even blushed at such whoredoms, fornications, and baudries as the Guisians
have been ministers and assistants of.

The Guisians sought to expel Katherine de Medicis.
Thence have they proceeded forward: For they were so maleperte as to counsel
King Henry to send his wife Katherine de Medicis home into Italy, whereupon had
not the Constable and Cardinal of Chastillon withstoode their determinatio^s,
she had assuredly repassed the Alps: howbeit afterward trusting that she
should have remained barren (which was their whole desire) they yet lived in
hope of recovering the Counties of Prouence and Anjou, yea and peradventure of
the crown of France it self which was one cause of their allia^ce unto the
daughter of that great Seneschal and manifest harlot, through whose means they
sought to drink up as with a sponge all the substance of this poor kingdom,
Their great ^es grounded upon an ^arlot.
for the atteining whereunto they first procured to her the custom commonly
called, Tilletage (which is as much to say, as an incredible sum of money
rising of the renewing of the offices of the whole realm, which sum, if all
at once it should be disboursed, would surpass the prodigality of al Princes
that ever were) hoping after her to enjoy the same them selves.

During these matters, the Lord of Reims gaping after more promotions, whereby
he might the better order his intents, through the means of the aforesaid
Seneschall obtained favorable letters from King Henry to Pope Paul the third,
who in that time curryed favor with all Christian princes, to the end through
their aid to be revenged of the Emperor Charles the fifth, for the death of
his abominable son Peter Jews, whereby also the Lord of Reims (whom the
Seneschal called but master Charles) filled his own bags with the sale of his
masters favor. By means therefore of these letters, Charles made Cardinal.
about the end of Iulie in the year 1547 he was created Cardinal, upon
occasion whereof under pretense as well of the Council of Boulogne, as also of
many other affairs which him self devised, he undertook a voyage into
Italy, through other two principal motions. The first was for the concluding
of the marriage aforesaid of his brother unto the Duke of Ferara his daughter.
The other to the end to show his person, and so be known in Rome, whereby he
might in time to come the better order his driftes and devises. Being there he
took upon him the title of Cardinal of Anjou, but into what peril, through
that presumptuous folly, he brought him self, most men do know. For had not
the great Seneschal stood his friend, he never durst have showed his face in
France any more, albeit howsoever it came to pass, he was compelled to leave
his title of Anjou beyond the Alps, and at his return to accept the surname
of his ancestors and country, whereupon we shall hereafter call him (as him
self has especially after his uncles deceasse done) the Cardinal of Lorraine.

At his coming home to ye court he so labored king Henry, The Guisians
dealing with Cardinal John their uncle
that ye Earldom of Aumale was erected into a Duchy thereby to hasten the
marriage of his brother Francis unto the aforenamed Duke of Ferraras daughter,
which shortly after was consummate. After this time began they to procure their
own aduancements, and to lay the foundation of their tyranny over al men both
rich and poor in France. We will therefore begin with their uncle Cardinal
John, who was the instrument to translate master Charles from the College of
Navarre unto the Court. Not forbearing until that through his decease he might
enriche them with his benefices, they never left (especially master Charles) to
pluck from under his elbow all that possibly they could, through a kind of
importunatenes not far different from mere violence. This good nephue found
means to make his uncle desirous to forsake the court, procuring unto him
such servants as pleased him, and frustrating him of those which were the most
faithful under whatsoever color he thought best, and dealt with him in such
manner as that to his power, he stripped him even into his shirt: in so much
that shortly a soden death (for he lived over long for his nephues commodity)
carried him away, at his return from the election of Pope Julius the third in
the year 1550. At that time did his nephue become famous in Rome procuring a
Cardinals hat for his brother the Cardinal of Guise, the ouerliuer of all the
six brethren, at which time also was ended and consummate the aforesaid
marriage of the eldest brother unto the daughter of Ferrara.

Having thus unclothed their uncle before he were ready to go to bed, let us
consider how they handled him after his death. This man dyed indetted unto many
merchants, but especially of Paris, leaving such wealth in moveable goods as was
great, yea and more then sufficient to have discharged al. After his deceasse,
his creditors drew toward his nephue the Cardinal of Lorrain, who together with
the Cardinal of Guise had raked up al his livings, but himself alone had
seized upon all the moueables, to whom he answered that he was not his heir:
For such men do never account him heir, who seaseth upon the goods, and, as
the practitioners do term it, do meddle with the inheritance, but him only,
who says, I am he. But now no man spoke that word, for the Cardinal of
Lorraine meant to have the goods of free cost, and as for his brethren, they
would not pay because they had not the goods. Again it is not unknown that
benefices by a certain rigor of Law are not chargeable with the dettes: If
therefore the said Cardinal of Lorraine had at the first willed most of them to
look for nothing, yet in losing of their dettes, they should have been good
gainers, for then should they have saved both their time and cost, which they
wasted in waiting almost two whole years, to know the end of this fetch which
he caused one of his men to play, to whom he gave commission to peruse the
dettes of the party deceased, and the same to verify, and set in order as he
termed it, with other such like terms of practice which still were in this
commissioners mouth. In the mean time they do make an inuentory says one, a
description says an other, a remembrance says another, but whatsoever it
were, among all the dead man's mouables, was to be found in the end, nothing by
the report and conscience of his nephue save a few old stools and settles,
with a little rotten tapestrye good to make sport with all, which to be brief,
was the whole inue^tory of all that, that the Cardinal would not have: But the
sport was to hear his talk hereupon. Whenever the merchants of Paris came
in his presence Me thinks (would he say) these fleas do bite me an other
time, Tush they be Englishmen, Saluters, or giuers of good morowes. Again
coming to the particulars, To one, he is an vserer of Paris, to an other, he
has not yet delivered his wares, to an other, he sold it for six times more
then it was worth, to another, he has received some money in part of payment,
to another, Nothing is dew, signifying you get nothing, which title
comprehended the greatest number. But unto those to whom he showed greatest
favor, he used to say, Help to pay your selves, not meaning Hold forth your
hands and take, but give and acquit: For when a man had forgiven half, or two
third parts, yea three quarters and more, yet looking upon his book, he
should find no more received, then that which he had acquitted and forgiven.
And for the rest, Ask would he say some composition, some right or privilege,
or some other thing of the King, and I will healpe you unto it, which was as
good as if he should have said to the mercha^ts, Go every one of you kill one or
two, and I will procure your pardons, for the sale of the settels, stools and
tapestry was put of until the day after domes day. Whereupon two notable
merchants among other, beholding this shameful dealing, did after diverse
motions finally offer, to acquit the party deceased of al his dettes for one
quarter, or at the most, a third part of the yearly revenue of al his
benefices, and yet could come to no end: part of them nevertheless did finally
obtain, some a quarter, others a fifth part, others a tenth part, some more,
some less, but the greatest number could get nothing at al. And yet for so
much as each one did acquitte, al, or at the least the most part, were driven to
give acquittance as for money received, to what end each one may sone perceive:
namely to defraud the creditors of their honor, and the Cardinal of the
remembrance and thinking upon their liberality. Thus by little and little, he
dispatched away the Merchants of Paris and such others, to the end the more
easily to fight against the mightiest, and generally against all the estates of
the realm, whom he and his brethren must necessarily subdue, before they can
attain to touch the white whereat they do leuel their shot.

their qua^ for the ^uchie of ^niou.
They had wrested a promise from King Henry whiles he was Dauphine, whereby
when he were King, the County of Prouence and Duchy of Anjou should return
into their hands: But because the General de la Chesnay had therefore clawed
them to the quick, that matter lay still until the Kings entry into Angers,
for then they begun afresh to quarrel this Duchy, desiring the only title
thereof for one of them: Howbeit one only frowning look of the Constable did
quite so overthrow them, that from that time they never durst once open their
mouths any more for that matter.

^hey ^ught to ^come the ^rinces fe^wes.
In the mean time therefore, they went another way to work, which was, by
seeking openly to become princes, and both openly and secretly to suppress the
princes: To which effect their practices have been of long continuance, and as
strange as possibly might be, as by the only historye of the late Prince of
Conde is most evident, and our selves will here and there show by diverse
particularities worthy to be remembered.

First, in as much as neither the worthiness of their blood neither their family
could prefer them before diverse french gentlemen, but only the prerogative of
their lands: therefore to cover the default of their race, they have caused to
erect their simple baronages into Duchies, pri^cipalities, Marquisates and
Counties, which is the thing that hitherto has blinded the eyes of the
commons, who are utterly ignorant of matters of estate.

Secondly, they have endeavored to make the estate of the Peers (for the
Cardinal was one) equal unto the Princes, yea, even to prefer the said Peers
before the Princes, whereupon happened in the year 1551 a notable matter, as
thus. The court of Parliament of Paris, had sent six of the chiefest members of
their body unto King Henry, to understand his will and pleasure concerning
certain articles, whereof one was.

The second point is to enquire of the King, whether it be his pleasure that my
Lords the princes of the blood, with other great Lords entering into the said
Court, may wear their swords. For time out of mind that has been lawful for
the King only, as an especial prerogative of his Royal dignity, who has the
hand of justice, as being justice himself, and mainteyning in assured safety
the ministers of the same. And notwithstanding sundry times some princes or
lords have entered with their swords, that has been only when coming suddenly
they have found the door open, or else by entering at unawares: either have so
done by the Kings express commandment, at such time as he has been
displeased, or provoked to wrath against his said Court, upon some other
occasions, whereof nevertheless no rule or custom ought to take place: For
contrariwise ye late King Francis, when he was Dauphin, together with the Lord
Charles of Bourbon coming in, left their swords at the door, which order King
Jews the twelfth caused still to be observed. This judgment of that court,
which according unto right and equity prefers the princes before al lords
whomsoever, together with the sitting to this day observed in the same, and the
arrest pronounced against their father, did so grievously move the Lords of
Guise, that to the end to breed some debate and contrariety, between the
judgment of the King and of his said Court of Parliament, also to augment
their own credit, and so by little and little to exalt them selves above the
Princes, they closely practiced that whereas the secretary, acco^modating
himself unto the request of the court and the order in the same observed, had
in his roll (as himself has since testified) named the princes first, they
were nevertheless in the Kings answer placed after the Peers in manner
following. The Kings pleasure is that when soever in his absence the Peers of
France, the princes of the blood, the Constables and Marshals of France shall
come and enter into his Court of Parliament, and into the chamber of Audience,
whether the doors be open or shut, they shall nevertheless still wear their
swords, the which the said King means not that any other of what estate or
calling soever he be shall do. Given at Fountainebleau the last day of August
in the year. 1551. signed Henry, and contresigned Du Their.

Thirdly, they practiced a wonderful subtlety, whereby with the time to yield
a kind of prescription unto such principality as they sought to usurp. which
was in seeking to allye themselves on al sides, in the most high and rich
manner that possibly they could, and so to slide in among the princes, and bear
the like port as they. As also at the entry of King Henry into the town of
Suse, Francis Duke of Guise presumed to march cheek by ioule with the King of
Navarre the first prince of the crown. Also at king Francis the second his
first coming forth of his chamber in his mourning weed, the said Lord of Guise
intruded him self between two princes of the blood, to the end with them to
bear up his train. Again, during the reigns of Henry the second, Francis
the second and Charles the ninth, and even at this present also every man both
has seen and plainly may behold, with what presumption the house of Guise
both have and still do encroche above the said princes of the blood, whom they
have oppressed and trodden under foot, as we will more plainly declare, after
that we have yet touched a few matters more, tending unto the discovery of
their raging ambition in this respect.

Fourthly, the house of Guise being thus advanced, grew very suspicious and
jealous of their honor, stoutly opposing the^ selves against al such as
withstode their atte^pts, as is manifest in this. The Frenchmen do so highly
reverence their princes, that as they are not to be accounted wronged, or in
their honors diffamed for any thing that their said princes either do or say
unto them, so do they also never set hand to their sword against the said
princes, notwithstanding that any other of what estate or calling so ever he
be, stranger or Frenchman, ought to take heed of misusing the person of any
French ge^tleman, unless he presently be minded to receive at the hands of
the party misused, as much, or rather more then he has done or said unto him.
Now the more that the lords of Guise have sought to become as Princes of
France, the more resistance have they found, especially duringe the reigns of
Francis the second, and Charles the ninthe, neither being as yet quite free
from the same, as in place shall be showed. Let us therefore consider some
examples of the time of Henry. The lord of Rochefort, youngest son of the
house of la Roche-guyon, was on a time challenged man to man in the Kings garden
at Fountainbleau, by Francis Duke of Guise, whereas in their talk he showed
the said Duke, that he accounted him not as a prince of France, whereof he also
afterward made him more plain demonstration, when as at the only countenance,
that the Duke of Guise made to set his hand upon his dagger, he the said lord
of Rochefort, who was no knight of the order, as now he is, set as sone his
hand to his sword, and thereby made him to be quiet: which deed both the
King and Princes did well allow of. This resistance caused that the same Duke
of Guise (who thought that the lord of Montmorency, against whom he had a
quarrel, notwithstanding he were not as yet Marshall, would do no less then
the other) on a time suborned his great companion the Duke of Nemours, and the
prince of Ferrara, at a place near unto the castle of saint Germain, shortly
after the Constables return out of imprisonment, and then went and plucked the
said lord of Montmorency by the cape in the Queens chamber (the meaning
whereof is not unknown unto the gentlemen) who presently without speaking unto
any man, arose and followed him out of the castle to the place appointed, where
he made him an answer correspondent unto his demand, accompting him therein
no otherwise for a Prince then before time: which afterward he showed him more
evidently at Paris (King Charles the ninthe being there the same time that the
meeting was about the edicte of Iulye) in a controversy concerning an ayrie of
hawks of the forest of Compiegne, which the said lord of Guise challenged by
prerogative: but the said ayrie finally remained unto the lord of Montmorency.
It is not unknown again how the President Liset in this point diverse times
withstood them: for once in the full audience at the Parliament of Paris, he
caused to correct ye quality of ye Prince, which the Duke of Guise in a
certain cause had taken upon him. An other time in the presence of King Henry,
he affirmed unto the Cardinal of Lorraine that he was no Prince, neither ought
to take place among Princes. Again at another journey before the said King, in
a foolish brablinge which the Cardinal made, the same President Liset used
unto him these words. My son and friend, you are yet to young to understand
those matters, which are no usual speches to be said to any Prince of France,
yea he added moreover these words, You are no Prince, neither equal with
Princes, if therefore you be determined to take upon you that title, show us
also the places of your Principality. This young son was above five and
twenty years old, and already both Peer and Cardinal. The aforesaid court
of Parliament did also an other time by sentence definitive, expulse the Duke
of Guise these men's father from his fore sitting, which by reason of his
Peereshippe he challenged above a prince of France. All which notwithstanding
their hautinesse in this point, brake out openly in diverse wise during
sixteen or seventeen months, whilst King Francis the second reigned,
whereof we must necessarily here note also some particularities.

Immediately after that King Henry was deceased, the Duke of Guise and the
Cardinal of Lorraine conveyed King Francis the second, his brethren, and the
two Queens into the Louure, leaving the Princes of the blood, and the rest of
the great lords of the Realm, which were not of their faction, behind to
keep the dead corpse: whiles in the mean time, them selves permitted no man to
come near the said Francis, or to speak unto him, unless at the least one of
them were still in presence, and that so diligently, that they never let him
go out their sightes. Then did they also drive away the Constable, and
displaced all such as they liked not of, causing the King to say whatsoever
them selves listed. They found honest pretenses to dispatch away the Princes of
the blood, by sending one into Flanders, another into Spain, and so of the
rest, having continually secret servants and privy spies about them. They
changed the estates and officers of the Kings householde, orderinge them selves
with such violence, that a man might (as it were at hie noone) perceive their
intentes. We will now therefore orderly show you what people withstood them,
and in what manner: For such particular resistance was to small purpose, in
respect of that which followed.

We must now therefore consider, to what estate their ambition have brought the
affairs of France, being accompanied with covetousness, cruelty, ungodliness
and manifest villanye. I say therefore, that since the time that they were
exalted by means of the Seneschall, considering also that their children be of
a troublesome and perverse disposition even to the end, they never desisted
from persecuting all sorts of people high and low in this Kingdom, whereby to
satisfy their aforenamed passions: yea for want of means and opportunity to
persecute them whom they do hate, they have bent their whole rage against them
selves, in so much as it is doubtful to whom they have done most displeasure,
whether to their friends or enemies.

We will therefore begin with such mischiefs as they have practiced, first
against our Kings, then against the Princes of the blood, afterward against
the great lords of the Realm, and so consequently we will proceed to the
estates, namely the Nobility, the officers of Justice, the people, the
Clergy, their favorites and friends, and finally unto their own injuries
among them selves: setting forth the whole in as brief manner as possibly we
may, desiring the readers to quote down in their books, whatsoever they
perceive that we have omitted, to the end to participate the same unto the
posterity, which thereby shall be occasioned for to abhor the misery of
France, which has suffered and borne so much, with over great respect many
times of such dangerous monsters. After the same manner also, according as shall
be incident in the continuation of our discourse, we will somewhat touch their
virtues, to the end each one may know by what tokens to remember them.

^mea^ of the (...) of (...) to^ ^he (...) of (...).
Notwithstanding that at the first they were not over busy, neither kept to
great a stir, yet afterward persuading them selves that they had some right
unto the Crown, they endeavored to make thereunto by all means possible,
whereof one was by assubiecting all the world under their feet, whereby
although they were no Kings in name, yet tarying the time they were so many
times in effect. In the time of Francis the first, who was sufficiently
acquainted with their humors, they profited not greatly. Afterward in the time
of Henry the second, their horns began to shoot out: for he was of a mild
disposition, but of small forecaste, and very easy to be led about by the
nose: and so was he afterward rewarded. For the ambitious covetousness of the
house of Guise replenished Germany, Italy, France, and Flanders with blood,
it set to sale to the most giver the laws of justice, and with infinite
exactions it soked the purses both of rich and poor. With their insolences
and cursed conspiracies, they have also defiled the Kings house, wherein they
have erected the scaffolde, whereupon they have brought in the horrible
tragedies of the destruction of France, and there have heaped up the stacke of
wood, which them selves did afterward so sore kindle, that the flames and coals
thereof do yet remain. But this we must by little and little ouerlooke, wherein
we are to recite word for word, the lamentations that have been made and
published long since.

The great King Francis had left France in reasonable good estate: but the
house of Guise, smelling out a thousand commodities arising unto them selves by
the wars, could not suffer the Realm to continue quiet. It was unto them a
gate to advancement, as was evident by the heat and violence of the eldest and
third brother, whom the Cardinal never doubted to hazard, knowing that
howsoever things chanced, his enterprise would counteruayle them: again, in
case they were more happy then wise, it were an assured means to exalte him
self even to the hiest place that might be: but if they chanced to be slain,
their death should serve as a bridge for the rest to pass over further, so him
self moreover, having the chief superintendence over the treasures of the
Realm, it was more easy for to fish in pudle then in clear water. Besides all
this, the Cardinal perceived that by one kind of means, he might both
obtain the favor of those, of whose quarrel he intended the commodity of his
own race, at the cost of the poor commons, and also should diminishe the
Kings forces, whose crown he wished to behold upon his brothers head, with
the triple Papal crown upon his own. Finally, this was also the assured
mean whereby he might hazard the King, the Princes of the blood, and all
other of whose destruction depended the increasing of his honor and power.

These were therefore the goodly occasions of this long and cursed war, which
has been dispersed over the whole Realm, whereunto it was no mastery for them
to frame the Kings mind, being of him self but of small experience, and at
his atteining to the crown, desirous of new honor and conquest over the
sworn enemy of France, who at that time having (as it was thought) subdued
Germany, seemed terrible to this Realm, unless such his driftes, as he might
have practiced there against, were speedily cut of, to which end there were
three especial occasions offered which greatly might hinder him.

The first was the breaking of of the Council of Tridente, whose authority the
Emperor used, in the uniting of all Germany unto his devotion, whereby he
might afterward both in Italy, and other where do what him self thought
best.

The second was the undertaking of the restoration of the house of Farneses,
whom the Emperor had expulsed out of Plaisance.

The third was the practicing of the Elector Maurice and the Marquise of
Bra^debourges army, who lying at the siege of Maydenbourg, were greatly moved
against the said Emperor, for the detaining of the Landgraue of Hesse, witn
whom there was some likelihood that the son of the said Landgraue and other
Germane Princes would easily join. And notwithstanding that all these three
devises were utterly repugnant to the Cardinals former profession, which was to
be accounted as an assured pillar of the Catholic faith: seeing that by the
first, he hazarded the King and whole Realm into danger of the Popes curse and
excommunication, and so manifestly did withstand the magnificence of the
Apostolic seat, whereof he counterfeited so earnest a defender: by the
second, he troubled the quiet of all Europe: and by the third, did openly
join the King in league with the Lutherans, who by that means should have
better opportunity to multiply and strengthen them selves then ever before: all
which notwithstanding, this fatal enemy both of God and man, would not
therefore quayle, or give over his purpose in any of them all, but motioned
King Henry, over whom he in effect reigned, to practice them all one after an
other. This was the original root of the protestation against the Council,
and of the war of Parma undertaken against the Pope, for the appetite of this
proppe of the Papaltie, and at the excessive charges of our poor Realm, all
for the commodity of a bastard child, who since has given us a reward
correspondent to the expectation of all wise men. Hereof proceeded the first
causes of all the most woeful and lamentable calamities, that ever our poor
Realm of France did endure: for it was finally expedient that this impostume
should have an issue, and that these furies should raise a civil war in
Germany, by the which notwithstanding that God has chastised the iniquities of
many, yet have there thereof proceeded so many mischiefs and murders, that it
is to be marueiled, that the Turk has not yet taken hold of this occasion,
and so passed over the bridge which the house of Guise have builded, and so
come even into our bosoms. From this root proceeded their voyage into
Germanye, whereas they missed of their purpose, for God would not permit that
country to come in their claws: howbeit such was their cruelty, that their
own country of Lorraine was the first that felt the force of their rage,
receiving therein a meet reward for bringing forth such children into the
world. Their first enterprise there was so to be revenged upon the Duchess
the widow of Francis, and mother unto Charles now Duke, who had disdayned them,
that thereby they hoped to have intrapped the whole Duchye. To which end they
dispersed abroad a thousand slanders against the said widow, bringing her
finally into displeasure with King Henry, never ceasing until that under
pretense of protection (for the most notable mischiefs do still bear the
fairest show) the said King had taken the young Duke into his hands, in full hope
that having the King favorable unto them, and the Duke and Duchye, as it were,
in their own hands, they might in time hit the marcke, whereat on that side
they leueled. But as God in all his works is wonderful, so has he brought to
pass, that the Duke and Duchy of Lorraine never found surer or more steadfast
foundations, then the same which their cousins of Guise had laid in intent to
overthrow them. For King Henry took charge of the child, and afterward made
him his son in law, committing his Duchy into the hands of his uncle the
Earl of Vaudemont. Hereunto adding their practices against the town of Metz,
what farther testimony shall we need? For what mischief is there which this
poor town has not suffered within these few years, both within and without,
being under color of protection, bereaved of her liberty, dismembered from the
Empire, for the most part destroyed, and as a fullness of al miseries reduced
into the bondage of the Cardinal? who under a borrowed name, has yearly wrested
therout at the least a hundred thousand francks, leaving unto our King nothing
but the dishonor of surprising the same under pretense of defense, the charge
of keeping of it with inestimable expenses, the loss of great numbers of
Frenchmen, and the hatred of the Empire, which yearly renews the decree of
the recovery of the towns of Metz, Thoul and Verdun, expressing therein their
desire at the first opportunity to restore the same to their former liberties.
For soon after ensued the siege of Metz aforesaid, whereas the Cardinal
fearing his brothers skin, and seeking to exalte him above al men, procured
to be sent unto him most part of the Princes and great Lords of France, for his
more assurance, and at the price of their bloods to raise him as it were unto
the shoulders of Victory it self: But what need we to purchase the triumph
with the offense both of God and man? or at the charge of the Kings honor and
treasure? Also, how sweetly have we paid for this so valiant defense of a
foreign town, which never offended us, unless it be an offense to give over
hasty credence unto the words of a Cardinal therein brought up, whom she
accompteth as her bishop and pastor? yea to speak truly, the Frenchmen have
dearly bought the exchange thereof, through the burning and spoil of Picardie
even unto Noyon: when as under the conduct of the third brother of this race,
and son in law unto the great Seneschal Duchess of Valentinois, the French
nobility received the sorest wound that ever it had since the battle of
Pauie, because that without any reasonable cause they were trained thereunto,
as to a butcherie rather then a battle: For in the same conflict, wherein the
said harebrained Duke of Aumale the third brother was through his own default
taken prisoner, there were slain about two hundred French gentlemen, among
whom were sundry great Lords, as the Lords of Rohan, S. Forgeu, Nancay, la
Motte, Dusseau, the Baron of Couches, and of Castres, beside diverse other Lords
of name. Had our whole realm sustained that only loss through the conduct of
these men, yet were this sufficient to procure al men to detest them. Shortly
after this overthrow ensued the siege of Metz aforesaid, from whence the
Emperor being forced to depart, the Duke of Guise attributed to him self the
whole glory, which the Princes and great Lords of France, whom the Cardinal
had procured the King to send thither, had dearly paid for, whereupon it is
wonderful to see how the Guisians triumphed. Well, to proceed, what did the
next years following bring with them, other then two double and irrecuperable
losses, namely, the utter sack and spoil of Tirwin and Hesdin the two keys
of Picardie, by reason whereof the Cardinal sang out his triumphs, scoffing at
the French nobility, who, said he, through default of his brothers assistance
were overthrown by the enemy, persuading the King that he had no man, but of
that race, who was sufficient to guide the affairs both of peace and war.
Howbeit the imprisonment of the third brother, whom the Marquise of
Brandebourge held, did somewhat restrain the course of his brags, wherefore
they sought with speed to withdraw him home, to the end the one might heave
forward the other: and yet were them selves unwilling to disbourse any penie
of al their briberies and theftes, either to take any compassion of the French
nation, which was devoured to the hard bones. They invented therefore an other
reasonable honest shift, as they supposed, which was to borowe the Kings name
and authority, whereby they might under pretense of heresy, vex and torment
whom so ever they thought best, to the end to meet with some confiscations.
For it seemed not sufficient for him, through his temeritie and rashness to be
the cause of the death of so many great Lords, and gallant French gentlemen,
at his own taking: but now his ransom must be gathered out of the lives of
such as remained, not forbearing the wives of such good and virtuous Captains,
as in the mean season ventured their lives and goods in the Kings service.
Whereof the Lord of Teligny might have been a sufficient witness, had he not
shortly after lost his life in King Henry's service: For during the
imprisonment of the Duke of Aumale, the virtuous Lady of Teligny was unjustly
accused of heresy, at the instance of a Sorbonist one of the Cardinals
stalions, as are the rest of our masters his companions, who be men ignorant of
all goodness and honor, as fierce, cruel and seditious, as any alive, using
religion as a cloak to cover their peruersitie, in this respect altogether like
unto the Cardinal of Lorraine the setter of them on work at the cost of the
Kings honor, who for that cause incurred the evil will of many. In this fetch
they disclosed an other of their sleightes, for what with their sponge which
was laid close to King Henry's ribs, namely the Duchess of Valentinois this
prisoners mother in law, who by all means robbed him on the one side, and them
selves who ruled the common purse, they wholly spoiled the King both of the
love, and of the goods of his subjects, araying them selves in the same,
persuading him that nothing was well done, but what them selves did. Yea they
waxed so impudent, as to affirm that their brother had very well discharged
his duty, also that they whom he had led to the slaughter, had in manner
betrayed him, insomuch that the whole fault was imputed unto the dead, and he
the suruiuer, who had disobeyed the Kings commandment, who sent him word not
to hazard any thing, after his delivery returned to the court, where by the
means of his mother in law, he was as much or rather more cherished and made
of, then any of the lustiest lieutenants that the King had. Thus did they on
the one side laugh King Henry to scorn, whom in the mean time they had so
artificially bewitched, that he accounted him self to have none more assured
or faithful servants, then the said lords of Guise, except the Constable, whom
therefore they hated to the death, as they afterward declared in diverse wise.

These wars of Metz were nothing in respect of those of Picardie, whereof the
house of Guise were the kindlers, which also so long as the Duke of Guise and
the Cardinal had the dealings about King Henry, waxed still more and more yet
were they not content to hazard that part of the Kings estate, who thereby
lost Tirwine and Hesdine together with many great lords and gentlemen, besides
prisoners of name: but they also procured to him an other great blow in
Italy. It is not therefore requisite that we should here rehearse al our
damages, and loss of battles wherein were slain four or five thousand
Frenchmen, together with the Captains and gentlemen of Name: neither the loss
of the city of Siene, which has cost this realm so much money, buried so
many frenchmen, and beautified Florence with our shame, neither the bringing
of the poor inhabitants thereof into perpetual bondage, and in a manner utter
destruction: for to whom is all this more justly to be imputed, then unto the
jealousy of the said Lords of Guise who then governed al things, (This
happened in the years 1554. and 1555.) when they desired rather to defer the
promised aid, and so to put the whole army in despair, then to suffer it to
be reported, that without them the King had gotten Tuscane, or at the leastwise
compelled the inhabitants to come to such composition as him self would have
granted them.

These Lords of Guise did in the mean time frame sundry conspiracies in
Italy, whereby somewhat the more to increase their own honor: and al with
the treasure of the realm, and unto the Kings confusion. It is not unknown
how they quareled for the crown of Naples and Sicil, neither how the Cardinal
al his life time gaped after the Papaltie, persuading him self to procure
wonderful and strange alterations, in case he might once atteine to be God
upon earth. And so soon as the old Pope was deceased, the Cardinal provoked
through his wonted ambition, went not reasonably, but ran so fast as possibly
he could, to catch up the triple crown, which imaginatiuely with a vain hope
he did already devour. At that time did experience teach the French nation,
that this man where ever he became, drew al mischief after him. For immediately
after his departure, the Emperor Charles ye fifth and King Henry were sone
inclined to yield unto the better counsels, of such as spoke of quietness to be
granted unto the pore people, in so much yt notwithstanding the peace might be
concluded, yet through the grave advice of the Constable and the Admiral, there
was the fifth day of February, in the year 1556 an abstinence and truce agreed
upon for five years. This Cardinal according to his wonted manner, minded not to
go his journey to Rome at his charge, and therefore had assured King Henry,
that in Italy he would practice such leagues against the Emperor Charles, that
then he might easily be overcome, which, the King liking of it, stood the
Cardinal in stead, as a cover to hide his ambition and covetousness, who with
many circumstances (still at the realms charges) made Hercules the second Duke
of Ferrara, the Kings lieutenant general in Italy: But his chief drift was,
to make friends, and entertain servants, through whose aid together with the
power and treasure of France, he might conquer the Papaltye for him self, and
the realms of Naples and Sicil for his brother. So soon therefore as he was
advertised of the aforesaid truce, he was with the same greatly displeased, for
that it was the assured death of all his driftes in that respect, in so much
that he could not restrain his speech before diverse, but said openly as he
passed through Neuers, that this was not it that the King had promised him:
also that he knew a mean to break this truce, fully persuading him self so
to do, immediately upon his coming to the Court, which then lay at Bloys:
whereas so soon as he was arrived, and had spoken with the King, he finally
obtained through the means of his clients, and especially of Cardinal Carasfa,
(whom the Pope had sent to present the King with a rich sword,) a grant to
break the truce, notwithstanding whatsoever reasons the Constable, Admiral and
other great Lords could allege. The Guisians principal instrument was the
Duchess of Valentinois, who was to them a bridge both in body and mind,
wherouer to pass unto the Royal throne, for she commanded King Henry, and
they commanded her.

Hereby did they entangle the King in open perjury, and the realm in new
troubles, procuring the overthrow on S. Laurence day, the taking of S.
Quintins, the spoil of Picardie, and the peace unprofitably concluded for the
French nation. None but the Guisians hoped for any commodity of this news:
for the eldest of them aspiring unto the Crown of Naples and Sicill, procured
for him self a commission, to go and break the truce in Italy, accompanied
with six thousand Swithers, four thousand French men, five hundred men of
arms and five hundred light horses. It is not unknown to al men, that he
transported with him all the best soldiers that he could get, leaving,
according to King Francis prophecy, his son Henry in his doublet, and his
subjects in their shirts. For besides so many men whom he led away, the
Cardinal (who had the oversight of the treasury) had so soked the same, that
finally the King was brought to that stay, that through persons (who^ the
Cardinals covetousness had brought forth) interposed, the King was driven to
borowe the money, which proceeded from his own treasury. Moreover the rowles
and records of that time, and of the next year following, will declare what
excessive rewards the said Cardinal, and his brother did wrest forth of the
Kings lenity, while in the mean time the commons were vnco^scionably pilled,
the treasury (as is aforesaid) wasted, the demaines, receipts and cities
morgaged, the war revived, and the coast of Picardy come into the King of
Spaines hands. For the enterprises of Henry, who then followed the only advice
of the Cardinal, were so wide from prosperous success, that within short space
after, he lost the lamentable battle upon S. Laurence day, wherein were slain
John of Bourbon Duke of Anghien, the Vicounte of Turaine, besides many other
French lords and gentlemen, the footmen for the most part hewn in pieces, and
the Constable taken prisoner, besides a great number of other valiant lords
and gentlemen. Again, within twelve or fiftene days after, was the town of
S. Quintins taken by assault, whereby the King there also sustained a shrewd
foil.

We must not here ouerslippe a testimony of the Cardinals good will, toward
King Henry and his estate, as this. After the overthrow of S. Laurence day,
the King being destitute of men, money and counsel, (for as the mischief was,
the Cardinal only was left about him) this reverend father, in stead of helping
the King with his goods, or of relieuing his necessity with such coin, as he
had fished out of the said Kings revenues, even the next day after this
mischance, enforced the treasurer of the purse to pay him the most part of a
sum of fiftene thousand francks, which he pretended to be due unto him.
Throughout the whole realm there remained not so mean an artificer, or so
poor a citizen, who was not contributorie unto the Kings relief, and for the
same cause was not most extreemely dealt with all, whilst in the mean time the
Cardinal becoming a sergeant, executed King Henry in the chiefest time of his
misery, and when his affairs were in greatest danger, dalying with the
spoiled King with such impatie^cie, that he would not forbear until the said
treasurer of the purse had gathered up so much money, but drove him to borowe
the same sum wherewith to satisfy his request. Also at the same time the king
obtained in the name of a gift of the city of Paris, the sum of three
hundred thousand franckes, whereof the Cardinal had the disposing, which, how
or whereabout they were employed God knows. Let this therefore be
sufficiently spoken for a simple proof of infinite such like practices, whereby
it is to be doubted in which of these two the Cardinal did most exceed, either
in unreasonably hoarding together, or in excessive appetite to wast al France,
which he had chosen as a pray convenient for his ambition.

But how was the Duke of Guise occupied in Italy, (while the French nobility
was in the King of Spaines prisons) in laying the foundation of the greatness
(though invisible) of these our Lords and masters? The Duke had led with him a
reasonable number of noble men, and had dried up all the Kings revenues,
endeavoring in the mean time nothing in Italy, saving that for the
augmentation of his brothers credit, and the practicing of conspiracies under
color of simplicity, he went with his famous principality to prostitute the
dignity of one of the king of France his lieutenants general in Rome, to
dally among priests, and to make up a lower mess and last service at the
table of Cardinals, of whom the chief part are but the Popes Marmosets and
Apes. Whereupon sundry have commended the free stomach of one of the masters
of requests that accompanied him in the said voyage, who misliking of the said
Duke of Guises behavior, without any leave of the Cardinalitie, sat down
gallantly by the Dukes side, least it should have been reproched unto the
Frenchmen, that the Kings lieutenant general had served as a cloak bearer unto
such lickorous griediguttes of the Popes cauldron, who upon their own dunghill
do so lightly account of Christian Kings and Princes. But what of this? It was
necessary that France with the cost and loss of men should put up yet two
injuries more in Italy. The one by the said Lord of Guise, who left his camp
idle, and his masters business undone, to the end to loyter and dau^ce after the
Popes court, there to create (as the Cardinals hope was he would) some and so
many new Cardinals after his brothers mind, that in case the Papaltie should
be void, he might be as certain to succeed in the said room as a Cardinals
faith could extend. The other through the folly of the said Duke of Guise, in
that in his own person being a lieutenant general, he permitted his Kings
honor and reputation so shamefully to decay: The enemies of the crown laughed
heartily at such his folishe ambition, and the wisest Frenchmen supposed that
the King and the Constable had suffered the^ selves to be entangled in such
enterprises, to the end to be released of an intolerable burden, hanging
continually upon their arms through such continual alarmes, as the
inconstancy, covetousness, and vain glory of the Guisians did daily minister
unto the Kings affairs, exceeding the cost of two such conquests. Now the
Cardinals drift was, so sone as he were Pope, to transport the wars into
Naples and Sicil, which conquest was the way to have overthrown their whole
race, or else in achiuing their enterprise (wherein France should have won
more then by keeping them upon her hands as she has done) to have bound them
selves for their life time about their necks, a bond of the maintenance and
keeping of their new conquered dominions. Howbeit under this pretense the
Cardinal pinched at al assaies, insomuch that for this cause and others, he
iested with them in good earnest, who so cunningly turned the letters of the
name of Charles of Lorraine, that thereby he found this which truly we might
reproach unto him to be most true. RACLE AS L'OR DE HENRY, signifying, Thou
have scraped away al Henry's gold. But hereof we will speak some what more
particularly.

Proceeding therefore in our matter, after the loss of so many men at S.
Laurence battle, together with the taking of the Constable, and other
contrary chances, the Cardinal finding (as he supposed) the best occasion
possible offered for the advancement of his family, displaied at that present
his whole wit toward the execution of his purposes. The first was by making
his brother in effect during the reign of King Henry, a King: The other so
well to wrappe his yuie about the pinakle, that finally the one might overthrow
the other, which was by motioning a double alliance: the one, of his niece
Marie Stuard Queen of Scots unto Francis King Henry's eldest son, the other
was of his cousin Charles Duke of Lorraine unto the Lady Claude of France.
Again, the Constables absence, of whom the Cardinal stood in great awe and
fear, whom also marueilously he hated, did altogether hearten him on.

As for the first point, the affairs being troubled in Picardie, and the
realm void of forces, the Cardinal thought it best to call home those that
before were sent into Italy: and the whiles to watch, least any other should
have undertaken the superintendence and ruling of the affairs, hoping (seeing
the Constable detained) to commit the same into the hands of his brother the
Duke of Guise, presently upon his return: who about the same time had been
repulsed from before Ciuitella, so that this commandment came fitly to him:
The esquire Scipio also was sent to hasten him away, and to will him to bring
his power with him: being come, the Cardinal caused him presently to be sent to
Compiegne there to muster the army, whither as the King shortly after followed
him, publishing in the presence of his knights of the order, and Captains of
his army, that the Duke of Guise was come in fit time to preserve his realm,
and minded to have made him Viceroy, or under King of France: but forasmuch as
that title seemed strange, he commanded to dispatch him a warrant for the Kings
lieutenant generalshippe throughout all the said Kings dominions: the which du
Thyer secretary of commandments soon made in such manner as it pleased the
Cardinal to devise, being also afterward received and verified by the court of
Parliament of Paris, and sundry other Parliaments of the Realm, whereby the
Princes of the blood were contemptuously put back: as also after the taking of
Calais they procured the preferring of the Duke of Neuers before the Prince of
Conde, concerning the charge of the light horsemen: Yea, within a year after,
the Marshal Brissac was also preferred before the said Prince of Conde in the
government of Picardie.

The Duke of Guise having gotten this commission, and men over whom to
command, swelled manifestly in pride, whiles in the mean time the Cardinal
playing upon his harp in the midst of all these broils lulled King Henry on
sleep in the bosom of the villainouse Seneschall. Nevertheless Henry, who on
the one part vehemently loved his gossip the Constable, and on the other part
had not his eyes so overcome with sleep, but that sometimes he opened them, and
so perceived the Guisians taking over highly upon them, whereat he finally
begun somewhat to be displeased with him, not refrayning from discharging
presently part of that which afterward he considered more largely of: for he
excused him self toward his gossip, secretly certifying him, that he had been
compelled to make the Duke of Guise his Lieutenant general, also to agree to
the marriage of the Dauphine, with many other things against his will, but that
the time should do him right.

^a^ ^f the ^ine Marie
This marriage of the Dauphine was in this wise. The Cardinal perceiving no man
at the court able to controlle him: his brother upon his return out of Italy,
and the Constable prisoner, began to motion the marriage of his niece the Queen
of Scots: for the compassing whereof he propounded that the King might during
his own natural life, ^e of
behold as well his son a crowned King, as the Emperor Charles had in his
time seen his son Philippe crowned King of England. He procured also the
estates of Scotland to hasten this matter, soliciting them thereunto by the
lord of Oisell, who had the superintendence of the Queen dowagers affairs in
that country. Also to the end to cause the Queen of France to condescend
unto this marriage, who still alleged that he need not be so hasty, seeing
both the parties were in the Kings hands, and besides that her son the
Dauphin was yet to young, and not all the best at ease, he began to show him
self enemy unto the great Seneschall Duchess of Valentinois, and her to
blame so much as in him lay, as disdayning the remembrance of her alliance, no
longer remembering (or at the least counterfeiting forgetfulness) that she had
been the only ladder whereby both he and all his brethren had gotten up so
high. This did he, thinking it the readiest way to win the Queens heart,
who mortally hated the said Duchess, and not without cause as all the world
knows. To be brief, this practice so well served his turn in the
advancement of his business, that within seven months after the taking of the
Constable, this marriage was accomplished, and thence forth Francis was called
King Dauphin, and so consequently the lords of Guise the Kings uncles.

The taking of Calais, The ta^ of Calai^
the enterprise whereof the Constable, the Admiral, and the lord of Senarpont
had long before devised and forecaste, augmented the hatred conceived in King
Henry his heart against the Duke of Guise. For having often heard of the
easiness of the same, he had many times purposed him self to have taken it in
hand, but the Cardinal seeking the winning of the Frenchmens hearts unto his
own family, procured the Kings mind to be altered, and the charge thereof to
be committed to the Duke of Guise, who nevertheless made the matter very
dangerous, esteeming it impossible to bring to pass: yea he stood so much
thereupon (such was his valiantnes) that he protested that his proceeding
therein was only to obey the Kings express commandment, who incessantly
motioned the contrary, affirming no difficulty at all to be therein. Wherefore
seeing now how the commendations of the said Duke of Guise were therefore sung
and published over his whole Realm, he could not but openly affirm that the
said Duke had defrauded him of an honor to him self only appertaining.

^e peace ^cluded ^o the king ^payne.
Moreover, under matters of goodliest show outwardly, the Cardinal still
concealed strange driftes tending to the exalting of his race, through the
overthrow of France. He nourrished the wars of Picardie and Italy, he brake
the truce, he with his brother governed all for the satisfying of his ambition,
and preparing of his path to proceed further, and yet was not all this
sufficient. He must therefore try some other means. The Duchess of Lorraine
motioned some peace with King Philippe, whereof the Cardinal taking his
advantage, as shortly we shall perceive, procured to him self the commission
to go to her, to the end there to find out some other means, which was this.
The bishop of Arras now called Cardinal Granuelle, being come as the King of
Spaynes deputy to this enteruiew, alleged among other things, that France was
infected with Lutherans, among whom some were even of the chiefest lords,
naming the lord d'Andelot, adding also that some of the Princes were of the
same profession, who by means thereof lay in wait for the crown, whereunto
they might easily attain through the aid and supporte of the Protesta^tes, as
lately he had perceived. These words were not spoken in wast: for the Cardinal
thereby desirous to frame some practice, disclosed to Granuelle all that he
knew touching certain offers which the Protestante Princes had made to King
Henry, together with the meetings thereupon between the King of Navarre and
them. This spoke he now to the end to hear the others opinion, knowing that
unless he found some occasion to stir up households in France, his own
driftes would be in vain, and his family come to decay. Gra^uelle on the
other side, considering of what importance in his masters affairs the breaking
of these practices with the Protestants might be, together with the Cardinal
of Lorraine laid this foundation of peace: namely that their masters were
either of them of such force, that in case the one should overthrow the other,
a third person might easily overcome the co^querer, and therefore that it was
necessary to agree them in such manner, that with their whole power they might
together set upon these gospellers, thereby to get the recompense for their
own losses, first putting to death all such as were within the jurisdictions
of both princes, not sparing any. For the Cardinal of Lorraine hoped that the
Princes and great lords of France (which were thought to be Lutherans) being
dead, the King and Realm should thereby be so weakened that his family might
with less travail and cost enjoy the same. Also that their confiscations
might be employed to the winning of servants and friends. But that which most
of all encouraged him to undertake this matter, was that Granuelle showed him,
that he knew no knight or captain living more honored and regarded then the
Duke of Guise, who therefore was most worthy of such a commission. For
presently he began in a foolish kind of vain hope to swallow up whole
countries and kingdoms, persuading him self to strike his stroke under the
goodliest pretense possible, namely the zeal of Religion, all which was but
the destruction of Henry, his estate and succession. For the Cardinal having
once rooted this principal proposition in our Kings hearts, namely that they
ought to strain their consciences, also that unto Heretics they were not to
observe any faith, thereby he struck two wonderful blows. first, he drew to
him most of the Catholic great lords, especially the Constable and others
very affectionate protectours of France, whom he made his executioners in
cutting of their own arms and legs, by persecuting their fellow citizens.
Secondly, he should thereby make away the Princes, many noble lords, sundry
gentlemen and infinite true Frenchmen, who together yielded the crown
impregnable, and terrible in the eyes of their enemies. But under these two
fetches are hidden so many slights and practices, as that it is impossible to
name them all, wherefore we will hear rehearse some, to the end the readers
may the better call the rest to mind, not forgetting how that since that the
Cardinal had found this door open, neither the King, neither his successors
had ever any rest, because they have given over them selves unto such
pernicious counsel as has been also the destruction of the Cardinal him
self, and of most part of his abettours and supporters, and undoubtedly will
in time intrappe his whole family and progeny: in as much as it is the will of
God the just judge, that into the pit which the wicked have dug, them
selves shall first fall, and so be ensnared in the net that they have pitched
for others, and finally be strangled with the same coarde that they have
twisted for their neighbors.

To conclude, the peace was granted to the great prejudice of France, but the
Cardinal forced not of the price, so that it might in any wise serve his
purpose. The first article imported, that both the Kings should procure a
general council, wherewith to repress all heresies, which was as much to say,
as after that the Pope and his adherents had concluded thereupon, they should
on all sides assail the Lutherans, wherein the Duke of Guise should be one of
the first that should be set on work. As for the rest of the articles, they
were such, as that by the report of most men, the Cardinal in them showed him
self so faithful unto the King of Spain, that most of them proceeded in his
favor, without any, or at the least with very simple controversy. And
notwistanding both the Constable and Marshall of S. Andrews were joined in
commission with him, yet did both he and Granuelle extremely prosecute the King
of Spaynes commodity. As for the Constable, notwithstanding he plainly beheld
the open wrong offered to his master, and did somewhat smell out the Cardinals
intent, yet through an earnest desire which he had to return into France,
there to repress (through his credit with King Henry) the ambition of the
said Guisians, who in his opinion took their flight over high, the effects
whereof were partly discovered in the practice of the marriage of their niece,
for he began to fear least this fire should take such hold, as that in time
it could hardly be quenched, did therefore easily permit him self to be drawn
away after the Cardinals lure in these affairs.

And the Marshall of S. Andrews was no such man as durst withstand the
Cardinal: for having obtained his honor through such means as al men wot, it
was no news though his mind were servile and his heart of small force or
courage. Also although the Cardinal mistrusted that the Kings earnest
affection unto the Constable would procure, that presently upon his return he
should become especial and principal counsaylour unto him, yet accounting the
peace, as the briefest and most ready way to hasten the course of his thoughts,
he earnestly pursued the publication thereof.

About the same time, The Car^nals pursi^ against t^ Protesta^^
the Protestants through the favor of sundry great lords and judges of the
realm, began to look abroad and lift up their heads: but the Cardinal
presently caught hold of this occasion, thereby to further his intents: His
determination therefore was to quayle the upright judges, hereby to discover
the best affected, to the end to triumph either in suppressing their
constancy, or else in rooting them out, to plant men of his own begetting in
their rooms, whom afterward he might govern as he list, and through whom
he also might undermine al other. proceeding on still he knows that the
protestants must either forsake their religion, or else maintain the same. The
forsaking of it, is the means at better leisure to bring them into bondage and
fleze them. The mainteining of it must consist in the support of the mighty,
and men of authority, who thereby shall consequently be excluded the court and
al affairs of estate: whereby he and his supporters shall bear such sway as
finally no man shall be so bold as to withstand him. he moreover assured him
self in such wise to provoke King Henry against the mightiest, that the place
should remain empty for him and his brethren of Guise. He thought this also a
very honest opportunity to trippe the Constable, by reason that his nephews
of Chastillon, together with the King of Navarre and the prince of Conde, being
wrested from him under pretense of religion, he should lose the principal stay
of his force.

^he Cardi^^l joins ^ue with ^e Parlia^ent of ^aris.
Hereupon he strikes one of his greatest strokes against the Court of
Parliament of Paris, beginning first with the President Seguier, who was gone
to the court, there to sue for the pay of certain pension due unto him and his
companions. For when he had pronounced his oration before the King, the
Cardinal stepping forth said unto him. I suppose not that any man seeks to
stop your wages, provided that your selves do faithfully execute your
vocations: and then having sharply rebuked in the whole body of the Parliament
their wincking at the forming of process against the said protestants, caused
the King bitterly to reprove the^, and to command them to call the Mercurial
which was the very net, wherewith to entrap ye hardiest. And having in the
parliament many assured servants, through their report he so enflamed the
King, that he determined personally there to assist, whereas having by course
heard the definition of every man, he emprisoned Anna du Bourg and other
cou^sellers. This was the Cardinals proceeding against the fairest pearl in
King Henry's crown, procuring, under the beautiful pretense of Religion, the
notablest company that was in any place to be found, by little and little for the
most part to be converted into a troup of slaves, deuoid of al other honor
saving the robe and outward countenance: so that among all the mischiefs which
ever the Cardinal wrought in France, this has been one of the principal.

Also God justly moved against such confused abuses as then began to take
root, especially Atheism, Magic, injustice, whoredoms, with other infamous
dealings, began to execute his judgments, whereof the Guisians took occasion
the more to trouble the estate. For King Henry dyed suddenly, being one of the
chalengers at the tilt with the Duke of Guise, who followed him at the stripe
whereof he received his deaths wound.

We have already plainly perceived how by the wars of Picardie and Italy,
The behau^ours of the Guisians toward the person of King Henry.
the Guisians emfeblished the estate of King Henry. Now let us therefore mark
their dealings toward this princes person, as well in his life time as also at
his death.

This Prince naturally was mild and courteous as al men do know, but in
brief, they marueilously altered his nature, so that had he lived any longer,
the peace with the King of Spain would have hatched terrible tragedies in this
kingdom. Before his coming to the crown, he was committed to the government
of the Cardinal, who sought only to corrupt and spoil him, becoming his baude
and minister of amorous behauiours. The very stones, cabbins and hangings of
the house of Reims, wherein infinite whooredomes have been committed, do yet
speak of the same: yea not content to entertain about his person the Duchess
of Valentinois, to the Queens great grief and spite, they did through other
inferior servants entise other ladies and gentlewome^ on al sides, to the end
through such accursed means to win the favor of this prince through the
loss of his soul. We will not here speak of the filthy and foul adultery
which they procured him to commit at his return out of Piedmont, while he was
yet Dauphine, neither of that, that they have brought unto him such as belonged
very near unto them selves, to the end he might take his pleasure with them,
that is, pollute him self in sundry and strange wise. How often has the
Cardinal fretting at his brother the Duke of Guise, said unto him, that never
uckold sung fair song? Let others weye with them selves whom he touched.
Peradventure Henry had companions, but he was the first lost in these
filthinesses, through the dealing of these men. Hereof it came that for the
destruction both of his body and soul, soon after his coming to the crown,
they invented a thousand means to entertain him in wantonness, and turning his
mind from God, in succession of time to set al in trouble, whereby themselves
might fish the better. We must therefore view some particularities. Queen
Katherine de Medicis remained barrein sundry years, whereof King Henry being yet
Dauphine was very sorrowful. These our lords hereupon having brought in the
Seneschal, endeavored to procure Henry to send home his wife into Italy. Yea,
once at Rossillon upon Rosne they held a great parliament in full determination
to send home this Queen, who afterward was well assisted by the Cardinal of
Chastillon in the same matter. Then seemed she an earnest Christian. on the one
side, the Bible was still upon the table wherein sometime her self read,
sometime she caused others to read: On the other side, it chanced that upon
the commandment of the great King Francis, Clement Marot had translated
thirty psalms into French, which were set in music by sundry good
musitions, for both the King and the Emperor Charles the fifth had allowed of
this translation, as appeared both in their words and rewards: But whosoever
loved or fervently embraced them, ordinarily either singing or causing them to
be soung, this young Prince Henry then Dauphine was nothing behind, whereupon the
Godly praised God, and his minions, yea the Seneschal her self counterfeited a
love of them, and would say to him, My lord, Shall not I have this? you shall
give me that if it please you. Whereby sometimes he had enough to do to satisfy
both his own fancy and theirs also. Howbeit he especially kept for him self
the hundred and eight and twentieth Psalm, beginning thus, Blessed art thou
that fear God, etc. Whereto himself set a tune, both very pleasant and
correspondent unto the words. The same did he so often sing, and cause to be
sung, that every man might thereby perceive how desirous he was to be blessed
in stock, as that psalm does importe. Shortly hereafter the Dauphine
multiplied in children: but her husband Henry in stead of acknowledging such
a benefit, began to follow the abominations of this villainous Seneschal,
doing worse then before, so that I may (as I suppose) say this blessing was
turned into a curse, whereunto the Cardinal of Lorraine was a fit instrument:
For he perceiving that Henry delited in these holy songs, which are the
bulworkes of chastity, and capital enemies unto al filthiness, fearing lest
thereby with the time he might be won the better to love his wife, and to
send away his harlot, and so consequently the credit of my Lords of Guise,
being builded upon so filthy a foundation should fall down, began first to
reprove the translation, and then the Psalms them selves, substituting in
their steades the lascivious verses of Horace, together with other foolish
songs and abominable love matters of our French Poets whom he brought into
credit. Then began Ronsarde, Iodelle, Baife, and other vile Poets to come into
estimation. And God no longer permitted his Name to be so profaned, but
plucked away his praises, to the end to commit them to the mouths of infants
and babes. The Psalms, and Marot him self were together banished. Al kind of
vile songs and lascivious music took place, through the especial favor of
the Cardinal the Mecenas to al these villainous inuenters. And the better to end
al their labor, they through the Seneschal took from the King al godly
music, and deprived the Queen of her chaplain Boteyler, who in those days
preached the word syncerely, giving unto King Henry a Sorbonical doctor of
their own, a man both ignorant and wicked even to the end, and so plucked out
of his heart, that little spark of godliness which peradventure was entered
therinto. Afterward, they became King Henry's companions, especially after he
was King, yea in more wise then honesty could endure. Here therefore to
rehearse and stir up such villainies, it were but to much to trouble the
readers: Let such therefore as can call to mind all the time passed, since the
year 1550. even unto death, with me reduce before their eyes the wicked
practices which the Guisians have practiced upon this poor Prince. First in
the destruction of his soul, maintaining a harlot in his bosom, and behauing
them selves so unworthily in his service, as that willingly I would to God I
had never heard speaking thereof. The very tablets made and presented unto the
Cardinal him self, together with his countenances and manners of behavior have
sufficiently showed it. Again, what goodness have they done to the Queen? Nay,
what evil have they not committed against her? Henry left four sons alive.
First, how they dealt with Francis, we shall presently perceive. What confusions
have we through their means been tossed withal, during the reign of Charles?
Or if the Cardinal lived, how would he handle Henry the third through the
means of Queen Louyse of Lorraine? Loved he the Duke of Alenson? Nay, but
contrariwise at the Kings departure into Poland, he defrauded the said Duke of
the lieutenantshippe, conferring the same to his nephue the Duke of Lorraine,
and under color thereof governed more malepartly then ever before. But al
these injuries do require a more exact discourse, which hereafter we will look
upon. Thus therefore having scorned Henry and al his, they have replenished
his house with abominations, and his realm with troubles, they have destroyed
the mighty, entrapped the mean sort, and brought al things into such
confusion, that in man's judgment the kingdom is past al hope of restoration,
or being reduced to any small form of the pristinate and ancient glory. In
this Prince Henry the seconds life time, also they began to note out such of
his servants as displeased them, dispersing some of them abroad, bringing
others into displeasure, removing from the King his faithful counsailers and
bringing in their own minions and bondme^, through whose means this Prince was
persuaded that the Lords of Guise were his most trusty and faithful servants,
who sowed dissension among the other Princes and great Lords, to the end that
drawing the one party unto their side, they might with the less labor
destroy the other. All these particularities shall better be seen hereafter in
their order, whereby these injuries shall plainly be perceived. At this present
thus much we will say, which also al true Frenchmen will stand unto: that
considering the brevity of King Henry's life, he did them in so short time
more good, then any King his predecessor did ever unto al his whole household
together: he suffered more, he bare more with them, endured more sorrow, grief,
vnduetiful behauiours, losses and hindrances by them, then ever master, friend
or father sustained at the hands of their servants, companions, or children.
For besides that while he lived, they infinite ways and times, turned away from
him, seking the destruction of both his body and soul to their powers, they
have also contaminated his house, marred his children, and consumed his people:
even at his death they have showed what regard in his life time they had unto
him. We heard before how the eldest brother perceiving the death of the great
King Francis at hand, scorned him, calling him yoncker. They al now have been
nothing behind, but have uttered many more signs of disobedience, and of their
treacherous hearts toward King Henry at his death, who was their especial
friend, natural Lord and mighty benefactor. What a sight was it to the French
nation bewayling the so untimely and unlooked for death of their Prince, to
behold at the same instant of his deceasse, the Duke of Guise and the Cardinal
of Lorraine with joyful countenances, taking their young King and nephue, and
transporting him from the Tournelles unto the Louure? Yea, there was one who
seemed to name that day, and that not impertinently, the Even of the feast of
three Kings. For there was no man so ignorant, but that viewing these Lords on
horseback, might well judge that France should now have the King inheritour,
King in name only, and the two Lords of Lorraine Kings in effect, or at the
least, two crafty and cruel tyrants, a since they have manifested them selves.
Moreover it is the duty of the great chamberlain to take the charge over the
dead Kings corpse until it be buried: Now the Duke of Guise was great
chamberlain, for he had even in manner forcibly taken the same office from the
house of Longueuille. Who then let the Duke of Guise and Cardinal of
Lorraine, having a King at their devotion, yea, if we may so say, at their
commandment, from doing their duties, but that needs they must presently
forsake the corpse as some filthy carrion? What may be said of them that so
shamefully abandoned the corpse of their King and Lord, nothing caring or
thinking upon the guard and burial of the same? for the which cause both the
Constable and al other the Kings trusty and faithful servants remained still
behind. Yea, if they had but stayed until the body had been cold and
assuredly dead, or at the least if they had but showed some countenance of
sorrow. Howbeit peradventure this inhumanitie proceeded of that they had gotten
some inckling that King Henry was minded to drive them away, presently after
the triumphs and feasts were ended: or rather their own ambition permitted
them not long to defer the discovery of that which their hearts conspired,
which was, under the name of their nephue Francis to reign over us, waiting
better occasion to proceed. Well peradventure they dealt better with Francis
the second, and so behaved them selves, that now they deserved to have their
former offenses concealed. Let us therefore see whether it be so or not.

^eir beha^urs to^rd Fran^ the se^d.
This young Prince, being sixteen years old at the most, reigned scarce
seventeen months fully: but we may say and lie not, that never Realm in
seventeen months space was so shaken as our poor France, all through these
men's ambition: yea I dare affirm that in case God for the just punishment of
our sins had prolonged the said Francis reign other seventeen months, the
house of Valois had utterly lost the crown, and the whole nobility might well
have prepared them selves unto death, or other strange bondage and violences.
The people, the officers of justice and even the Clergy them selves could have
assured them selves of no other then most horrible tyranny. To the end
therefore, that all this may the more evidently be perceived, let us marcke the
ordering of the Realm in the said seventeen months space. First they
ravished the King out of the hands of the Estates of the Realm and officers
of the crown, conueying him even at the hour of his fathers death into the
Louure, with his brethren, mother and wife. There they so warely watched him
and diligently kept him, that no man might come near him, unless some of the
Guisia^s were at hand. At the same time also began they to be called the Kings
kepers. They drive away the Constable and others, they send away the Princes of
the blood, one to carry the order into Spain, an other to conduct the lady
Elizabeth, another to confirm the peace in Flanders: and finally used them, as
we shall see coming to speak of their dealings toward sundry Princes of the
blood. They take or rather wreste from them the dealings in the affairs of
estate: for when the Parliaments had sent their deputes to the King, he gave
them to understand that his two uncles, the Cardinal of Lorraine and the Duke
of Guise had the whole dealinges: commanding that thence forth all men should
resort unto them in all matters touching the estate of him and his Realms and
dominions, charging all men to obey them as him self. Here you see them by
their own instrument declared Kings: for this young Prince being of no
experience, and miserable in that he was lincked in to such company, said and
did nothing but what they lusted: because the Cardinal had so enured him to his
signs, that at the least motion of his countenance, the King spoke, walked or
held his peace, etc. In so much that he was also termed the Kings life or
soul, for, to say the truth, he caused the King to move or stand still, yea to
counterfaite what countenance so ever he thought good.

Having scatered the princes and lords whom they suspected, let us behold how
they dealt with the rest. As touching the privy council, after they had once
assured them selves of the Chanceler Oliver whom they revoked, who also so
far forgot God and him self, that he gave them his conscience, they brought
thereinto whomsoever them selves reposed any confidence in. After the time of
Henry, the Parliaments consisted of such men as had brought in most money, and
the chiefest favor of mighty men. The Guisians considering that they stood in
need of such men, had brought in by little and little the children of the
greatest usurers and extortioners, with such other manner of people, who have
corrupted all divine and humane equity, and retailed such offices as they
bought by great, or had in recompense of some bribes, reueiled contrary to
their oath the secrets of the Court, and finally violated justice in all
sorts: so that it was an easy matter for the Guisians to order these courts
at their own devotions, brideling some, and replenishing other some with vain
hope. That which touching these matters they had practiced in the time of
Henry, they did now under Francis the second more hotely proceed in, in so
much that since they have had great supporte on that side. They began also to
order the estates of the Kings household, usurping therein the office of the
Constable as then great Master still. To the end to bring in their own
servants, and men of their own conditions, they displaced part of the late
Kings officers, who before had still continued from the father to the son,
whom they least under pretense of good husbandry: others they dismissed giving
them half pay in the name of pensions, notwithstanding the new estate of
household officers did far surmount the other. The provinces of the Realm and
frontier towns, were furnished with their supposts, and such as liked them not
were sent home to their dwelling places: All governors, heads and captains
of wars and towns, were commanded to obey the Duke of Guise, as the Kings
own person. The revenues were put into the hands of such as the Cardinal most
favored, and all the courts of Parliament were admonished, that he had the
superintendence over all matters of estate. To the end them selves only may
remain armed, they forbid the wearing of all arms, especially of dagges and
fire woods, also of long clokes and great hosen. For the Cardinal being of a
cowardly nature, was warned by a Necromantian at Rome, that he should be slain
with some fire staff through the envy of such enemies as he should procure in
France, when he were at his highest degree of honor.

Their first tyrannous practice was in persecuting the Protestants in the
persons of certain counsaylers of the Parliament of Paris, especially Anna du
Bourg, whose process is amply described in sundry treatises and discourses,
especially in the history of Francis the second lately set forth, which
reueileth sundry villainous iniustices and wickedness, committed by certain
judges whom the Cardinal had apposed and suborned.

An other practice was in raising the commons against the Nobility in manner
following. For to suppress such as might contrary them, also to obtain the
goodwill of the commons, and to make their government agreeable unto them, they
published letters of reuocation of all alienations, as well for life as years,
whether they were in recompense for service or otherwise, except sales, the
coin whereof had been bestowed upon the Kings great and weighty affairs,
without any collusion, together with the appanage of the daughters of France,
and the dowry of the late Queen Eleonor, which the infant of Portugal did
possess, all the rest were thereby reunited unto the Kings demaines and
ordinary receyts. This was the way to bring the mighty into their hands, and
procure them selves more servants then before, by obteining for them such
declaratory letters as them selves listed.

The third practice was by driving away the King of Navarre the first prince of
the blood, through the most unworthy means that might be, which also shall be
mentioned in the treatise of their dealings against ye princes of the blood.

By the fourth they wrested from the Constable the office of great Master, for
the Duke of Guise, and bought the Marshall Brissac with the government of
Picardie, which they plucked out of the hands of the Admiral of Chastillon.

In the fifth, to the end to fortify them selves against the preparatiues
framed for the repressing of their tyranny, they made eighteen knights of the
order at one clap, making of a mark of knighthood, thoroughly tried and
unblameable, a collar unto all kind of beasts.

For the sixth, considering yt all this was not sufficient, but that with the
time it was to be feared, lest ye estats would challenge their ancient
privileges and liberty, by means whereof their licentiousnes would lie on
long, first they caused the King wonderfully to mislike of the voice that
went, that the people was determined in the Kings minority to demand the
estates: and this brought they very subtly to pass through diverse sleights,
ye principal whereof was to bring the mightiest into fear through some notable
means, and so to win the Queen mother, that she might be the instrument to
strike this stroke. They therefore propounded unto this woman, who otherwise was
sufficiently pinched with the burning yrons of her own ambition, that if the
estates should take place, as the enemies of her auctority wished, she should be
sent to dress and trim her garde^s, or else conveyed over the mountes: and
therefore, that as her faithful servants, they counsayled her to look to it.
Now they regarded not her so much, for in case King Francis had ouerliued the
King of Navarre, and Prince of Conde, whom they were determined to put to death
a little before that the estates were houlden at Orleans, they would sone have
made her to have scudded, for they marueilously suspected her mind and nature:
it was therefore their own commodity whereat they leueled. But this woman
feining not to perceive their subtilties, told them that she believed their
words, and still the more and more to establish her self, and play them some
fine pra^cke, she writ to her son in law the King of Spain, complaining upon
the King of Navarre and the princes, as if they had sought (by means of the
estates) to reduce her unto the estate of a handmayd Sone after returned the
packet out of Spain, wherein King Philippe writ how he was certified that
certain seditious persons and rebels, endeavored to move some troubles, seeking
to alter the regiment of the kingdom so wisely already established by so many
counselers, and by the late King Henry his good brother and father in law, as
if the King his brother in law were not of him self capable to administer it,
or to commit it unto such as he thought good without the intermedling of any
other consent, or receiving any law at his subjects hands, which he ought not
to permit: wherefore for his part he would willingly employ his whole power in
the maintenance of the authority of him and his ministers, although it should
cost both the life of him self, and of forty thousand men whom he had in a
readiness, if any man should attempt the contrary: for, said he, he bare him
so great good will, that he would declare him self the tutor and protector
both of him and his kingdom, and also of his affairs, the which were to him
in no less recommendation then his own. Thus may you see how the heredital
enemy of the crown of France was called to the defense of their tirannye.
Many accounted these letters full of wonderful presumption, that a foreign prince
durst thus openly in the presence of the whole privy counsel (for these
letters were read among them al even before the King of Nauarres face) abolish
the french liberty, and overthrow the authority of the estates. But the
Guisians had already advertised him in what estate all things stood, and in
case matters had so fallen out as they began to do, he had had his share among
them. So at the same instant, these the spaniardes letters were as effectual as
they desired, for presently the King of Navarre began to cappe them, and of his
own accord to seek al occasions whereby to return to the defense and custody
of his country. howbeit the better to walk him, he together with the Cardinal
of Bourbo^ and the Prince of la Roch Suryon who were joined in his commission,
were appointed to conduct ye Lady Elizabeth the kings sister who was married to
the spaniard, and her at ye frontiers both of France and Spain to deliver up.

Now therefore peceiuing that the more they sought the hastening of the
overthrow of France, the more they opened the mouths of al true Frenchmen,
they determined to fortify them selves by alluring the Parliaments, the
Clergy and the men of war to their parts. The Cardinal supposed the
advancement of religion, and multiplication of the professors thereof, to be to
him a goodly pretense wherewith to entice the Clergy: As for the Parliaments,
in as much as many of the counsaylers and presidents placed in the same, came
in at the windows, and were men but of small consciences, they needed no great
labor to hasten them forward to the assubiecting of them selves to the house
of Guise, for such good men as remained, being terrified with the examgles of
Anna du Bourg and others, laid their hands upon their mouths. Also the men of
war seeing the Princes hold their peaces, and perceiving the Duke of Guise in
his armor, whilst others both high and low were in their shirtes, waiting
every hour for to be slain, took part with the mightiest. And
notwithstanding al men, one and other, were assured by sufficient conjectures,
that the drift whereunto the house of Guise aspired, was far other then they
represented: yet they being watered with a certain vain hope, also to the end
to maintain the^ selves in their imagined prosperity, as men utterly deuoid
of understanding, did wholly cast them selves headlong into this goulfe.

The Guisians being thus in favor, and having expulsed al such as were not of
their band, did determine better to look to their matters upon this occasion.
As King Francis grew, so did he more and more reueile an assured judgment of
his evil health. Now had they married him to their niece the Queen of Scots,
and had betimes procured him to taste all worldly delites, and bewrapped in his
wifes swathing cloutes, to the end to yealde him the more supple and delicate
to their handling: But this Prince being sickely, who also in his youth had
foreshewed a most dangerous evil disposition, by reason he could neither hoake
nor spit forth, caused that certain his physicians of the creation of the
Guisians, secretly warned them to provide for their own estates, for as much
as the King was no man of long continuance. Upon this report, the Cardinal
having already most men bound to his hand, to the end to find out their
affections toward the King, would sometime bewail the misery of the present
time, also the Kings vnweldines, who should not peradventure have leisure,
said he, to punish the heritikes, so that al things might after his death
happily be turned otherwise. Having then struck this stroke, and finding that
many did even half wish that he would invent some steadfast means, proceeded
on inferring upon the Kings sickness, whom maliciously he after a manner taxed
of leprosy, and that in double consideration: First to bring the Frenchmen out
of taste in their natural love which they bear to their Kings, because the
King was (as they made men to believe) infected with such a contagious disease,
and so to prepare them against a new change: and next to bring the protestants
into such hatred (whom he pretended to make authors of this brute) with the
King, that through his commandment they might be utterly extermined, to the
end that they being thus made away, the Guisians might find no man to
withstand them. Following this determination, they bruited abroad through
their partakers, that the King went to Bloys to take physic for the spots
in his face, and when any man asked the meaning of such speech, these spies
would closely whisper them in the ears, saying, that assuredly King Francis
was infected with leprosy, and that to the end to procure his health, he must
necessarily be bathed in the blood of many young children: also that there was
already a commission given forth for the taking up of the most beautiful and
healthful from four years old unto six. To be brief, these ruffians which
followed the Court, being hired by the Cardinal, went abroad into the
boroughes, towns, and villages along the river of Loyre enquiring of the
number of children, being presently followed by an other number, who inquired
whether any had been there to take a register of their said children, willing
them to take heed how they did deliver them, because it was to the end to
bathe the King in their blood. These voices mightily terrified all the country
about Loyre, and the King after his coming to Bloys heard thereof also, whereat
both he and his mother were greatly moved. But the Cardinal cast all the fault
upon the Protestants, so persuading the King, that he kindeled in him such a
hatred as remained printed in his heart unto his lives end. Howbeit one of
these villains who had spread these news, and under color of warning the
parents had gathered great store of money, being taken nere unto Loches, and
found guilty; and so finally condemned to be beheaded, confessed, maintained
and affirmed even until his last gasp, that the Cardinal had caused to give
this commission both to him and many others. Al which notwithstanding, they
bent against the Protestants, and although that a month or five weeks before
they had published a sufficient rigorous Edict against the said Protestants,
yet did the Cardinal now set on a fresh onset of three Edictes in November,
1559. In one of the which these words were expressed. That in the assemblies
both by day and night of the Protestants, not only the use of the Romish church
was villanously profaned, but also that there were sundry vile words, both
infamous, and reprochful against the King, and such as in deed tended only to
the encouraging of the commons to sedition, were there also dispersed and spread
abroad. But all this served only to provoke sundry persons, yea, such as were
indeed enemies to the religion, and to move them to suspect that there was
other matter then religion, which in this point, as also in many others,
served but for a shadow. In the mean time the Guisians raised such a blotte
upon their nephue, that although he were no leper, yet after those reports he
lost most part of his reputation.

Hereupon also arose two new accidents, which brought the Cardinal again out
of temper: the one was because the president Minard one of his slaves of the
Parliament of Paris, was slain with a dagge by unknown persons: another was
that one of his good servants named Julian Ferme, was also killed near unto
Chambourg where the King was. This Ferme was departed to carry many
remembrances to Paris, concerning the making of the processes of diverse of the
greatest Princes and Lords of the realm, together with many notable persons,
favorers of the religion. The Cardinal therefore taking his advantage of these
occasions, gave a new onset with this slander aforesaid upon the Protestants,
and by letters patents forbids the bearing of arms more straightly then
before, through such reports bringing the King into the hatred of the people,
which never was wont so to be suspected. During these affairs, namely the
three and twentieth day of December, the Counsailer du Bourg was put to death,
together with sundry other Protestants in diverse places, to the great
displeasure and grief not only of sundry Frenchmen, but also of many
foreign Princes.

Howbeit all this is nothing in respect of such confusions and mishappes, as the
Guisians did afterward entangle the King and his dominions in. For their
dealings openly importing tyranny, their usual threats against the mightiest
in the realm, their setting back of the Princes and great Lords, their
despising of the estates of the realm, their corrupting of the chiefest of the
justices, who were reduced to the devotion of these new governors, the
revenues of the kingdom at their commandment divided, and given where they
pleased, as likewise were al offices and benefices, and to be brief, their
violent regiment being of it self unlawful, had altogether provoked and moved
such hatred against the^ both of great and small, that thereof proceeded the
enterprise whereof la Renaudier was captain in the name, and under the aduow of
the second Prince of the blood, the handling and breaking whereof we will more
largely declare in the title of their behauiours to the nobility.

At this present let us mark how at that time they mocked the king and his
estate. Of the enterprise of Amboyse.
A certain advocate of Paris named des Auenelles, had warned them that there
were certain practices in hand against them, whereupon they used the help of
the Queen mother in calling the lords of Chastillon to the court, where by
their advice they framed a new edict in the Kings name, in the which they
qualified the rigours of such as before stood in force against the
protestants. This did they only to the end to break of the said enterprise,
minding incontinently after to revoke the same, as by particular letters they
certified their bond slaves of tne Parliament of Paris, whereas this edict was
immediately published, and the qualifications inregistred in the secret
register, in such wise nevertheless that some counselers so far forgot
themselves, as to say that it was but a false trap to catch the protestants in.
This was their dalying with the Kings faith, bringing upon our Kings an
infamous blot and blemish, namely to be periurers and unfaithful. In the mean
time having fresh aduertisements, instead of thinking upon their regiment, or
effectually declaring that they meant not to be such me^ as hitherto they had
been reported, either that they sought to tread down the Kings authority,
they now gathered power on al sides, gave money out of the Kings coffers to
Auenelles and other spies, sent men of war every way, and kept the king in
the midst of them selves, procuring, during these broils, certain letters
whereby the Duke of Guise was made lieutenant general for the King with all
absolute authority: then was there no talk but of putting al to fire and
sword, and slaying of infinite noble men and gentlemen, and so blemishing the
name, honor, sight and reign of this young King, with the most horrible
cruelties that ever were known. for the firmament, earth and sea shall be
witnesses of the barbarousnes of these monsters, who have replenished al France
with blood, the heavens with witnesses and judges, and the earth with
complaints. Their treachery appeared in that they would never permit the King
to hear (as he ought to have done) the just complaints of his subjects, whom
they so villanously entreated before his eyes. He often demanded even with tears
what he had done against his people, why they should be so moved against him
(for these Lords still blew in his ears that they sought to slaye him, and
under pretense thereof, had environed him with troops of armed men, gathered
from among the worste members of the whole realm, whom since they have
continewed to the end to keep themselves about our Kings, whose dignity they
have thereby converted in to I wot not what kind of Persian pomp, or Turkish
terror) and said that he would gladly here their complaints and reasons. yea
sometimes he would say to his good uncles: I wot not what these commotions
mean: I hear say that you be they who^ the people is offended withal: I would
to God you would for a while depart, to the end we might be the better
certified whether this people be grieved at you or me. But as the murderer that
held his enemies father in his arms did by that means save his own life, so
the Guisians joining them selves (as the yuie about the pyramide) close to the
young Kings sides, did conningly ward these blows, wherewith undoubtedly they
should have been pierced through. They did therefore reject al these the Kings
words, assuring him that neither he nor my Lords his brethren should remain
one hour after their departure, because (say they) the house of Burbon through
the support of the heretics sought utterly to root out him and his. Thus may
you see how they enuenimed the King against his blood and people, naming to him
Valois in stead of Guise, openly playing at King put of thy coat, and yet
could not their cruelties stop men from casting these things in their teeth
both in word and writing, being accused of weakening, devouring and wasting
both the King and his Realm. But all this shall more particularly be described.
The Cardinal was then so malepart as in the Kings presence to swear by Gods
blood, that the Baron of Castelnaul should die for it, and that no man should
save him. In the mean time the Kings edicts posted every way, and the Duke of
Guise the more to floute the King, and doubting lest the execution of so many
might procure him more hatred among al men, fearing also least this word,
estates, which already began to tingle in their ears, should tickle the
peoples hearts, thought it best to save the lives (after the manner of a thief
which holds a man in his mercy at the corner of a wood) of the most part of
the poor soldiers who were come on foot: which was done, giving every man
closely a testorne.

I will not here say that they counseled the King to slaye the Prince of Conde,
neither speak of the means which they used in washing and clensing them
selves in innocent blood, neither of the slanders which they laid upon the
dead persons, or of their fair promises for time to come, and al in the Kings
name, and yet observed nothing: for we shall have time enough to speak thereof
more largely hereafter. But I will set before the readers an other wonderful
injury, which their ambition wrought against the King and his estate.

Their niece who was married to Francis the second, was Queen of Scots. Wars
in ^cotland by ^he Guisians ^eanes at ^e cost of ^rance.
Now challenged she some title to England, because she was the daughter of the
son of one of the sisters of King Henry the eight of England, pretending that
Queen Elizabeth, at this present reigning, might easily be displaced,
especially because that Marie Queen before her, being married to King Philippe
had declared her unlawful. They caused therefore their niece to take upon her
the title and arms both of England and Scotland, determining finally to
appropriat to themselves the realm of England at the cost of France, and in the
name of their said niece, whether it were by subtlety or force. Also the
religion which Queen Elizabeth professed, seemed to them a meet pretense to
win some power in England, where it is not unknown that there are suffered
over many of the popes affectionate servants. Again, the mightines of ye King
of France, together with the invincible allia^ce of both kngdomes was unto them
an other cover or cloak, under the which they gathered together many secret
servants and pensioners, who sold their wicked consciences by gold weite, and
in scoffing at the Guisians, persuaded them that for the attaining of England,
it was requsite first to came the Scots, who for the most part were become
protestants. For by this goodly exploit, the English Catholics should have a
sufficient gage of their rest for time to come: also that it was necessary that
one of the six brethren should remain still in Scotland. During these
practices, there arose some trouble in Scotland about religion, King Henry the
second died, and they seeing themselves on horsback, determined to pursue this
pray with horn and cry. They sent therefore the Bishop of Amiens a very
nimble person in the court of the Church, who in one month should reduce (said
he) all the strayed Scots, and with him la Brosse a hairebrained and furious
person, who should murder al in that realm. These two good commissioners being
arrived in Scotland, began in their own fancies to make partition of the
gentlemen's lands, and selling the bears skin which yet they had not taken,
they writ unto the Guisians that there were ways how to draw yearly two
hundred thousand crowns out of this kingdom, by putti^g to death the
nobility, and bringing the commons into subjection: also that there they might
well lodge a thousand French gentle me^, who should be to do the lords of Guise
service. God knows whither this council clawed them where they itched and
whither they maligned the Queen dowager their sister, and her minion the lord
of Oysel, who thought it not best to ouerrunne the said Scotts, who had blood
in their nails, as they showed well, making the Bishop to feel that they had
naught to do with his instructions, and compelling la Brosse to return the
same way he came, and to go and brag it in some other place, driving away
the priests, the Cardinalty and the Papalty, al which, had it not been for the
foolish ambition of the Guisians, might well have remained. Also besides this
blow they sustained an other onset on the coaste of England, for Queen
Elizabeth made a large protestation expressly against them, therein setting
before al men's sight the causes of these broils, to the Kings confusion and
the destruction of his realm. And whatsoever countenances or practices that
they made afterward, fastening (according to their custom) the foxes skin
unto the lions, yet gained they naught else on that side, saving shame to
themselves, and loss and hinderance unto the King and his realm.

Whiles they extended their wings so far of, in France one the one side the
protestants multiplied, and on the otherside such as misliked the government
of the Guisians, began again to take heart, notwithstanding the success of
the enterprise of Amboyse had in the beginning greatly quailed the greatest
part. Hereupon the Duke of Guise marueilously chafed that in his government of
Dauphine the protestants had first lifted up their heads, brought in sixtene
ensigns of the old bands of Piedmo^t, together with diverse companies of other
French soldiers, under the conduct of Tauannes, Maugiron and others, who made
marvelous havoc in those countries. Sone after also they brought the King to
Tours, where they did what they could to have had the town destroyed, for they
supposed that the inhabitants thereof had favored the enterprise of Amboyse,
and therefore a great while bare them a milk tooth.

^he Guisi^s resist (...) order.
Thus walking the King up and down, causing him to taste of the bait of al
pleasures, they abused his youth and simplicity, daily planting other pillars
of their greatness for time to come. and the more they se they were
contrariried, the sorer were they enuenimed and bent unto new practices,
bri^ging the King into the hatred both of his subjects and strangers, more
endamaging the realm in one month then, then before it had been in a whole
years war against the Spaniard: for it was incredible what exactions and
debtes they procured, also what goods them selves hoarded up, during the reign
of their said nephue Francis the second. These behauiours together with
extreme violence used, brought most part of the commons in manner into despair
of ever seeing France again in quiet estate, considering what blows these men
struck. To procure therefore some remedy, they first sent under the name of
Theophilus, an admonition unto the Queen mother, wherein the tyranny of the
Guisians was most lively set forth, the conclusion whereof was, that it was
necessary to provide for the government of the estate. also to counsel the
King according to the ancient constitutions and customs of France, and not
after the appetite of the Guisians. Also that the troubles for Religion were to
be appeased by a holy and free Council. The Queen mother being then in their
claws, and seeking by all means to please them, served their turn in stead
of a spy in all manner possible, and caused the bringer of this admonition to be
stayed, and afterward having sought in all places for this Theophilus, and put
the bringer in fear, even of beating, considering that such writings might in
time quench their fires, and turn the edge of their swords points, they
concluded to plant the Spanish inquisition in France, having first by secret
servants, maintained at the Kings charges, as well in Germany as other where,
to their powers defamed with all kind of slanders the said Protestants. Howbeit
the wisdom of the Chanceler de l'Hospital, who politikely handled these
thorns, after a manner brake this blow: For in place of the Spanish
inquisition they framed the Edict called of Romorantin, which forbad al
unlawful assemblies, comprehending under that title al preachings and exercises
of Religion. But in stead of appeasing the troubles, this Edict doubled them
in all places. The thing which most began to quicken their spirits, was a
book entitled the Kings Maioritie, written in the favor of the Guisians by
John du Tillet a clarke of the court of Parliament of Paris, notwithstanding
his entertainment at the Cardinals hands, should never have procured his
appetite thereunto, but in those days all men worshipped these our Lords, who
in deed were even as Kings.

To this book was made a quick and lively answer, which afterward was
followed by a number of other small pamphlets, for the which there was great
search made, yea, such as to cause to hang Martin l'Hommet, who had printed one,
called The Tygre of France, wherein the Cardinal among his other brethren was
painted out in all his colors. On the one side, the Cardinal fained a kind of
joy that he was thus made immortal, and on the other side, he practiced men to
answer these libels, which discovered his sleights, and already made his
Legend, immortalizing in deed the filthiness both of him, and of his whole
family. But among other, Du Tillet, who had received a shrewd yerke, excused
him self for ever after, and exhorted the Cardinal to provide for his affairs
by some other means, namely, by using against both the persons and goods of the
Protestants, al kind of rigours which he could devise, to the end they might
take no sure footing, neither have their minds at liberty: showing him that
he might particularly write unto the Princes, whose counsel the Cardinal
immediately followed as the most expedient.

^ew ruins ^f the ^ealme.
Now to maintain their credit among foraine Princes, and to discover whatsoever
was said or done, besides the ordinary ambassadors, who were at the Guisians
devotion, they did with store of coin win diverse Princes servants, having in
Spain, England and Germany, pensioners at the cost of the Realm of France.
Moreover, besides these they had in the courts of these foreine Princes, and
of the Princes and Lords of France also, other secret servants, to whom they
gave such pensions, that the only expenses of secret servants in France,
amounted to above twenty thousand franckes by month. They had also ordinary
posts, who ran spying in the ynnes abroad in the countries, to mark the
behauiours of all men, whereby sundry not thinking thereupon, were shortly
after imprisoned, and brought to that point that they were no more heard of.

These things thus established, they renewed their league with the Queen
mother, wrote unto al their partakers, and gathered up so many men as they
could, in so much that the Duke of Guise durst make his vaunt, that he had the
promises of twelve hundred french gentlemen of name, and the oaths of the
captains, with whom, together with the old bands come out of Piedmont, and
others whom he had at commandment, he would ouerrunne al his enemies. The
Cardinal also propounded unto the Kings council, that it were good to sease
upon the Prince of Condes person, who was burdened to be the chief captain of
the enterprise of Amboise: and hearing that he was gone into Bearn, they
persuaded the King that it was to the end to arreare new war against him,
and so to escape punishment for his former offense. This entry being made,
they dispatched out new commissions for the raising of men, to the end to
assail the King of Navarre, who had withdrawn the Prince, his brother. They
sent also the Marshal of Saint Andrews to epsy the Princes demeanor. They
fetched through the means of the Queen mother, one named la Planche, to the
end by him more particularly to hear the co^playntes of the Huguenots of
estate and Religion, whereby they might with new subtilties arm themselves
thereagainst. Also from that time forward they were so impudent, and she also,
if I be not deceived, as to affirm, that the means to remedy so many
discontentations, was by causing to march always a Prince of the blood, and
then one of the house of Guise, a Prince and a Guisian, and so forward.
Wherein they sufficiently discovered what mind led them. The^ they changed the
governors as they thought best, they sent la Motte Go^drin into Dauphine, and
others of their own stamp here and there, after this manner laying their nets,
the more easily to entangle their enemies.

And as Gods judgments in this one point are admirable, namely that the
stoutest contemners of his majesty have for a while all things succeeding
according to their desires, to the end their fall afterward may be the greater:
so happened it to the Guisians. For lying in watch, and not knowing at which
end to begin, la Sague a Biscain gentleman being sent from the prince of
Conde to solicit his friends, was taken at Fountainbleau with sundry
instructions, by means whereof together with his own confessions upon the
rack, they did more evidently then before, perceive the string of their
tyranny to be in manner cut a sunder, unless they took the better heed.
First therefore they imprisoned le Vidame de Chartres and the Prince of Condyes
mother in law: then sent they the County Ringraue unto the frontiers of
Lorraine, there to keep in a readiness a regiment of Lansquenets and two
thousand harquebuziers. They cause the old bands comen out of Piedmont, to
descend along the river of Loyre into Dauphine, faining that they would send
them into Scotland: but they soiourned in Gyen and about Mou^targis, there at
their need to assure themselves of the Admirals houses. There did they commit
infinite mischiefs, and yet escaped punishment, to the end afterward they
might do the better service, spoiling or ransoming the best houses, violating
the fairest virgins and women, and to the end to suffer no justice, it was
sufficient to accuse the plaintifs to be Huguenots.

^he assem^ly at Fou^^^inbleau.
Hereupon happened an other expedient means to bring their purposes to the
better pass. The Queen mother seeing so many preparatiues, also that among al
these tempests she could not easily continue, for that one of the parties
would humble her, for she more feared the Guisians a hundred fold then any
others, accompting her self certain, (as indede it was true) that if they
overcame the Princes of the blood, they would neither spare her children nor
her self: and on the other side if the Guisians were mated, in that she was
confederate with them, she was also in danger to fall with them: she therefore
asked the counsel of the Admiral and of the Chaunceler, who showed her that it
was necessary to propound unto the Kings council, that the princes, lords of
the realm, knights of the order and all other men of authority, ought to be
assembled together for to find means how to pacifye these troubles.

The Guisians therefore understanding this opinion, notwithstanding they
misliked utterly this liberty in the Admiral and chanceler, and were fully
resolved to pull them both down together with the rest, yet did they herunto
condesce^d, acco^pting this the best motion of al for ye attaining to their
poinct: for said they so soon as the King of Navarre, the Prince of Conde, the
Constable and the rest shall receive the Kings letters tending to that purpose,
they would not fail to come, and so should they all be brought where they
should be detained, without causing them so much pain as to go so far for
them. Again, notwithstanding they could not obtain this, yet at the least
they should have so many voices in this assemblye, that all their deeds
passed should be auctorized, and their degree established for the time to
come, so that hereafter it should be a manifest offense for any man to seek
to contrary them, and so consequently should in effect remain Kings of
France, attending until their other driftes might procure them so to be in
name also. Moreover if their enemies would not come to the said assemblye,
then should they have new matter against them, as well by bringing them more
and more into the Kings hatred and mistruste, as also by having the better
pretense to be revenged of them. Thus therefore there was now no question but
of sending of packets every way in the Kings name, and of their own letters to
their friends. Then did a great number of Knights of the order, whom they had
lately created, stand them in good stead, for there were so many voices won
to the confusion of the King and his realm.

But they used a wonderful craft toward the King of Navarre. For they caused
the Queen mother to write unto him not to fail, but come: but closely they
caused his own counselers, namely Descars his chamberlain, Bouchart his
chanceler and other their spies and secret servants who were toward this
prince, to will him not to come to this assembly, and by this means they gave
so shrewd a spurn at the estate of this realm that it feleth it yet: for this
Prince being put in fear, was cause that the government remained to these
Lords, who afterward anewe strengthened themselves.

In all this assembly were but three persons which pricked them, of whom two
especially angered them outright. For ye Bishop of Valence saying his mind
warmed them, but the Archbishop of Vienna named Marillac, made the^ thoroughly
to change countenance in his learned and bold oration concerning the
authority of the estates, and the urgent necessity of calling the^, concluding
with a national council also.

^the assem^e of the ^tates.
Entreating of the estates he showed first, that the same was the assured means
to withhold the commons in their duty, then what the estates were, and to what
end they ought to be assembled. Then that the complaints of the people ought to
be heard and examined in the presence of the estates. Thereupon he discoursed
very fitly of the evils which troubled the realm, and whereof the Guisians (not
naming them) were cause. These evils were the extraordinary over chargings,
which were so grown and multiplied, that the people were therewith
overwhelmed, the wasting of the Kings revenues, his great debts, the excessive
expenses of the realm, the ignorance of the auditors, the matters of estate
troubled, the Kings chief ministers burdened with turning al things to their
own advantage, and of reping their private commodities out of other men's
calamities, the King not obeyed, the people not heard and the government
disordered. Afterward he declared the great commodities which the assembly of
the estates would procure. By them the King should understand the particular
affairs of his kingdom, he should examine the manners of his people, he should
know his own part, and might provide for his own estate: he should become a
good shepherd, peaceably shearing his sheep without otherwise hurting of the^,
he should behave himself royally, that is to say, courteosly and holily: he
should be happy and obtain the beautiful title of the name of a Father of the
people, whereby the memory of King Jews the twelfe is most celebrated, and
shines as an example to the posterity, more then all the conquestes and
victories of his predecessors. Then that the people would thereby be the more
encouraged to the helping of their King. That whatsoever is ordained in such
assemblyes is very effectual to make the people quick and ready in all
obedience. Also that whensoever few folks are called to the making of laws,
the people do interpret that they were forged according to some men's
affections, and without examining such reasons as those who are absent might
have alleged in case they could have been heard. He added that the house of
France had flourished eleue^ hundred years a row, by conseruing the authority
of the estates: that the like had happened in the Empire, and in the realms of
Spain, England, Scotland, Denmark, Suethland, Boheme, Hungary and every where
else. He afterward answered to all the objections of such as sought to persuade
men to believe, that the assembly of the estates was the diminishing of the
Kings authority, and then did openly tax the tyranny of the Guisians, who
therefore did give him so little thanks, that after they had caused him to be
threatened, he was finally forced to withdraw him self, and then seeing in
what estate matters were, died for sorrow. His oration is printed and inserted
into the notable History of Francis the second, lately come to light, and
therefore we will no longer prolong these matters at this present. But that
which most of all drove the^ into a rage, was the Admirals oration, which
pierced the impostume of their tyranny: for speaking purposely of ye Kings new
guard, he showed that it was evil done of those, who had thus armed their Prince
against his subjects, and said plainly that in case the Kings officers feared
to be displeased, they should take away the occasions, also that the
displeasure was not against the King, (as to what purpose should it so be,
seeing he was but a child, who stirred not, neither did any thing without the
counsel or prompting of his uncles,) but against those who had the dealings
in the affairs of the kingdom, whereto it was easy to provide, so that al
might be compassed orderly, and according to the laws of the realm. The rest
of his oration tended to the same end as did Marillac. He spoke some thing also
of Religion. Then did the brethren of Guise show that they were Kings: for
besides that all the Knights of the order there present durst not define, but
said only that they were of the Cardinals opinion, they bent them selves
chiefly against the Admiral, insisting upon the new guard, and briefly showing
that their nephue Francis served but as a mask and cloak to their fellonie:
Which also the letters sent immediately after this assembly unto al Bayliefes
and Seneschals, did evidently declare: For the Cardinal had framed them, who
promised a mighty reformation in the Church, (but think with your selves how
the harlots do use to reform the stues) together with the estates, which were
summoned to the tenth day of Dece^ber, in the town of Meaux, and that in the
mean time that al governors and lieutenants of the Provinces (for the most
part servants and slaves of the house of Guise) should deliberately visit
their towns, to the end particularly to understand, and to make report unto
him of the complaints of the people, that is to say, on al sides practice the
establishment of their tyranny: Thus did they scoff at the Kings authority,
making void and frustrate this so notable assembly, as by the effects did
incontinently appear.

They added hereunto an other practice of wonderful presumption against the
King, which was by raising in arms all the companies of Ordinances, under
color that the enterprise of Amboyse was yet not fully quenched, although in
deed to destroy the princes of the blood, to deprive the estates of liberty,
and to make an end of marring all. Also for their better fortification,
understanding the return of the French troops come out of Scotland, by reason
of a treaty of peace, wherein the King had been constrained to agree to certain
both dishonorable and hurtful articles, through the foolish ambition of his
uncles, they joined them unto the old bands of Piedmont, Metz, and Picardie
for their own guard, besides twelve hundred others whom they had reserved,
over and besides the departing of the companies placed and sent into all
governments. Having then thus the sword in their hands, and being on cock
horse, they made a dispatche from the King their nephue unto the King of
Navarre, whereby the prince of Conde was charged with treason: and therefore
for his hearts ease, the said King desired the King of Navarre to send him his
brother in sure and safe custody: if not, him self should be driven to fetch
him, and that with such company as the force shall remain to him. The King of
Navarre and his brother answered so wisely, and with such constancy, as the
Guisians did well perceive that withal their power they could hardly come to
an end: and therefore they determined to use the Kings faith and promise,
whereby to deceive these Princes, and to get them into their trappe: and did
incontinently frame another packet, wherein the King sent word to the King of
Navarre and the Prince of Conde, that they might safely come to him, and
return again when they listed, assuring them in the word of a King that
nothing should in any wise be attempted against their persons, that peaceably
he would hear their declarations and iustifications, that they should not come
into any prison, neither that any man should make their process: only he desired
an answer of the Princes own mouth unto such points as he was charged with
all, and which he could hardly believe: to be brief, that they should be
received according to their estates and dignities, yea they should enjoy the
rank which unto them appertained in the dealing in the affairs, to the end
to have their advice and counsel whereby to bring all things into good
policy and order. Also as for the Religion, whereof the said lord Prince had
made open declaration and protestation, he would not, neither me^te that by
reason thereof they should sustain any trouble or disquietnesse. These poor
princes as true Frenchmen leaning upon so solemn a promise, although they were
not so blind but that they saw the lions pats of the Guisians, which waited to
devour them, neither so deuoyde of means, but that they could by force of
arms have raunged these usurpers and well enough come to an end, yet trusting
in their innocencies, and in the mean time led, as in an other place we will
more particularly show, they took their journey, and by little and little
dismissed their company, to the end with a small train to fall into their
enemies nets.

^he Gui^^ans make ^ing Fran^s the 2. ^rsworne, (...) vnfaith^l unto his ^ne
blood.
Now let us behold how they caused their nephue to perform his faith so
solemnly promised. The same day of the Pinces arrival, who were very
unworthily received, and little or nothing at all regarded, the King causing
them to follow him into the Queen his mothers chamber, addressing him self to
the Prince of Conde, said unto him that he had been certified out of diverse
places, that the said Prince both did make, and had made sundry practices
against him and the estate of his Kingdom, by reason whereof he had sent for
him hy his own mouth to know the truth: The Prince having pertinently
answered and showed his innocence, also having discovered the malice of the
Guisians (who fearing the touchstone were absente) was nevertheless presently
committed to the hands of Chauigny the Captain of the guard, and bondeslaue
to the Guisians, and by them sent expressly to conueye the said Prince to
prison: for they would not suffer him to remain in his brother the King of
Nauares custody, who upon his life answered for him, for he had enough to do
to save him self.

Now as a wicked conscience does never cease seeking like means to lean
unto, Their practices with strangers f^ the destr^ction of France.
so the Guisians seeing that they had undertaken a work which they should
hardly bring to an end, unless they were supported by others then Frenchmen,
notwithstanding that many had already renou^ced their liberties, they
determined to practice and draw unto them foreign Princes, through whose help
at their need to prevail. A man may well guess whether the King paid ye
players of these tragedies, also whether his authority were manifestly usurped
in this case. The peace before concluded with the King of Spain, contained
among other this condition, that both the Kings should with all force persecute
the Luthera^s with all extremity. This e^terprise being broken of by the death
of king Henry, was revived in the beginning of the reign of Francis, and then
slacked again through the enterprise of Amboyse. But now the Guisians having
two of their principal enemies in their power, determined (mocking the king of
Spain, in making him believe that they were earnest defenders of the
Catholic Church) so to root out the Protestants, that thereby they might
make their way to the throne, the playner. They therefore sent the Spaniard
word (who for his part lay also in wait, determining if fit opportunity
might serve to give them the slip also) that the King of Navarre, and the
Prince of Conde, under color of quareling at the government, sought to put the
King and his brethren to death, and through the aid of the Queen of England,
of the Protestant princes and of the gospelling Switzers to bring in their
Religion into France, and after the same also to prescribe a rule unto all
Christiandome. They used other slanders enowe, in the end whereof they added,
that if it pleased the king of Spain to maintein and favor them in their
government, they would stop all the harm that was meant to him, and would set
to their hands that King He^rys promises might be accomplished. Hereunto they
had such answer as they requested, through the help of the Cardinal of Arras,
who then thought to have found a good breach whereby to bring his master into
France: but had the Guisians become Kings, he should have had less entry then
before, and peradventure have been in greater care then before: for ambition
neither will, neither can abide a companion. At the same instant they also sent
to the Pope and to the Duke of Sauoye, also through the practices of the
Colonnel Freulich, who was at their devotions, they won the catholic
Switzers: determining the same winter to destroy all their enemies in France,
and the next spring, to go and assail Geneua, and thence against the Germains
and Switzers of the Religion. Also to the end the Spaniard might not on that
side be let by the Turk, who might have set upon his countries, whiles his
chiefest forces were entered into the King of Nauarres dominions, they sent
expressly to Constantinople to him, to accuse the Princes of the blood of
treachery and treason, and of having with certain men of a new Religion (which
acknowledged no Magistrates or superiorities) conspired to put the King and his
brethren to death: beseching him whiles they were busied in repressing those
men's presumption, not to innouate or enterprise any thing on the cost of
Italy or Spain, and that in consideration of the ancient alliance, amitye
and confederacy which had been between him and the Kings of France. Of him
they had so good an answer, that the Duke of Guise so far exceeded his
bounds as diverse times to say, that whatsoever happened, he had rather that
the Realm should fall into the Turks power, and remain under his dominions,
then to see the Lutherans and heretics doctrine (for so he called them) there
received.

Here you see wonderful preparatiues for the establishment of their greatness:
for within the Realm they were armed at all assayes, and had their enemies in
manner at their feet. They had the towns, governors, treasury and people in
manner at their commandment. The aforesaid foreine Princes favored them, and
peradventure should have had some share in the cake, as the Spanierd chiefly
looked for it, having so easily obtained truce of his great enemy the Turk,
to the end to set upon France, and therefore we may here see whereunto the
cruel ambition of these men had brought all things, in case God at the same
instant had not appeared, smiting them sundry blows on the ears, before they
could bend their gauntlets.

They had granted the assembly of the Estates, The Guisians practices broken.
the more easily to discover their enemies, and called the Kings letters
patents the mousetrappes to catch fools: but that let not but in the
particular estates of the provinces many things were propounded concerning
reestablishment of the Realm, as well in matters concerning Religion, as
policy, as at Bloys, at Angiers, and especially at Paris: for notwithstanding
all the greatness wherewith the Guisians made them selves every where to be
feared, yet was it published openly in the full Town house (when the Prince of
Condies imprisonment was known) that they would not permit the blood of France
to be trodden down by strangers. These reports hastened the prince of Condies
process, whom they purposed to put to death about the tenth of December. As for
the King of Navarre, they also sought his death, endeavoring to do the King
their nephue so much injury, as to make him the hangman of his own blood. And
even as there remained no more to do, but to execute this blow, to the end
afterward to strike infinite others, God struck Francis the second with an
impostume in the ear, which finally stifled him, and so he dyed the fifth day
of December in the year 1560. This death ouerthrewe all their enterprises, and
did so quayle them at the first, that when they knew there was no more hope,
they went and closed up the^ selves in their lodgings, replenished with
mistrust and incredible fear, from whence they departed not of a day or
twain, until they were assured by the Queen mother and the King of Navarre,
that they should have nothing done to the^. But they were not so far
ouerseene, but that they caused presently at their coming forth, to carry into
their lodging three or four score thousand frankes, which were left in the
coffers: insomuch that all the Kings treasures were wasted, but no man
withstoode them, which was thought strange, whereby men might plainly
perceive, that these things were not done without the Queen Mothers consent,
who sought through their authority to maintain hers: and to say the truth,
if she had not supported them, their noses had then kissed the ground: but the
sleightes and practices on that part do deserve an other discourse. I had here
in manner forgotten an other draught of the wickedness of the Guisians against
their nephew. For seeking to wash their own hands of all that was paste, and
the same to cast upon the Kings power and absolute will, notwithstanding he
were but a child, wanting both wit and discretion to be able to examine or
to enterprise such and so weighty matters, yet did they easily obtain of him,
that he should speak courteously and lovingly unto the King of Navarre, which
he did fulfill three days before he fell sick, declaring that the Guisians
had never enterprised any thing against him or his: but that of his own mere
motion, and contrary to their opinion he had imprisoned his brother the Prince
of Conde, and this he desired him to believe, and for the love of him and of
the Queen his mother, to blot out whatsoever evil opinion he might have
conceived against them. This practice stood them in great stead afterward,
for having wrested this confession out of the Kings mouth, whom herein they
caused villanously to lie, they did afterward stiff and stoutly deny
whatsoever might be objected against them, laying all upon the dead man's back,
offering the combat to any that would say that ever they of their own
heads had enterprised any thing at all.

Besides all the aforesaid practices with strangers, at the end of the
Estates in the Kings name, all the power of France should have been divided
into four parts, and led by the Marshalles of Saint Andrews, of Brissac, and
of Thermes, and by the Lord of Aumale, to make such havoc as all the world
may well think. For beside the utter subversion of all Estates, and
destruction of all the mightiest and most ancient houses which should have been
assaulted, were it for their religion, either for having taken the Princes
part, either for having spoken amiss of the King, with infinite such other
means, France should have been reduced to the Turks order of living, to the
end afterward no man might have had power to resist or withstand the
tyranny of the Guisians. Also if through importunity they chanced to forgive
any, it should have been with the condition of perpetual ignominy. Moreover
the Cardinal had used such diligence, that there was no corner in all the
Realm, where he had not the names and surnames of all the inhabitants, who
either were Protestants or of any dealing or enterprise to be able to hurt
him, or that had not ranged them selves after his devotion: and this had he
gotten by the means of certain Apostataes and secret servants, who
ordinarily went ploding about here and there, to the end to sound the hearts
and wills of men: insomuch that such truandes were made judges, and ordered
the sentences of life and death unto all the world. Now were they determined
so to have provoked the people against the Protestants especially, that they
should need no other hangman: and herein it was to no purpose to say, I am
none, for the Monks and other preachers hired to the same purpose in going
about, should pronounce the condemnations. The granting of this liberty to
the common people was commonly called as a watch word, The letting loose of the
great Greyhound, and there was no part of France which could have been exempt
from this calamity. Also the King of Spain was on his part so forward,
according to his time and promise made to the Guisians, that six thousand
Spanierdes had already taken the way toward Bearn, entending sodeinly to
surprise the Queen of Navarre, and both her and her children to put to death,
committing like murder of her subjects as of the King of Fra^ces: and in so
doing to stay and break the forces which were in Guyen. But so soon as the
Spanierd had advertisement of the Kings death, also that the Queen of Navarre
had discovered him, and so fortified her self in her strong holds, that he
should hardly without long siedge come by her, not knowing what fould the
affairs would take, doubting also to have those on his back, who had caused
his troops to come into the country, among who^ Monluc was one of the first,
upon promise of the County of Arminack: wherefore he retired without doing
any thing, considering also that such of the Kings letters whereby he had
granted the^ passage through Bayonne (which is one of the principal
forteresses and keys of the realm) whether they were many or few, and his
commandment to aid them with as much victuals, artillery, and munition as
they would require, would not now be of any force or virtue after the said
Lords death, how plain and full of threats so ever the same were.

their be^^uiour at ^e death of ^rancis the ^conde.
If the Guisians during the young King their nephues life behaved them selves
outrageously, they did not assuredly at his death recover their honor. In his
life time they kept him so diligently, that no man without their favor might
come at him, I will not here speak how they ordered him privately: For besides
that they glutted him with all fleshly pleasures before he was of age, they did
also replenish his household with corruptions and infamous dealings. Also
through their earnest desire that their Niece might have issue, and yet knowing
King Frauncis but simply disposed thereunto, in that his generatiue parts were
altogether dulled and hindered, they permitted many courtiers to have her
company, who did their endeavors to make her very fruitful: yet am I ashamed
to know that in a certain table which an Italian of Laques found means to get
conveyed into the Cardinal of Lorraines chamber, with certain letters from
the Pope in stead of our Lady of Grace, wherein were the said Cardinal of
Lorraine, the Queen his Niece, the Queen mother, and the Duchess of Guise
most lively set out, their bodies naked, their arms one about an others neck,
and all their legs enterlaced together. Willingly would I have forgotten the
execrable filthiness which I have heard reported of him and his brethren, by
such as in Francis the seconds time followed the Court, and were witnesses of
such things as appeared almost manifestly in all men's eyes. Francis had
despised all the world to the end to honor them, he had displeased all his
Realm to satisfy them and to set them alofte, he prepared to thrust the knife
into his own blood (a man may say into his own body) thereby to save them:
to be brief, he had hated him self to love them, and abased his own person
for their exaltation: and yet was there ever person dead of the pestilence,
whose body men did more abandon, then them selves did this? Thus it was. The
Custom at all times in France observed after the deceasse of the Kings is
such, as that they whom in their lives they have most favored, and who
especially have had the ordering and dealing in their affairs, ought to
accompany them to their graves, and during the forty days that they be kept
and solemnly served, wait upon their funeralles: This ceremony did the
Guisians cause to be most straightly observed after the death of Henry, and
hereunto the Duke of Guise was in double manner holden and bound, for enjoying
(together with the sovereign authority) the great Mastership of France, which
do namely bind those that do enjoy such a dignity: yet all this
notwithstanding, so it was, that none of the house of Guise did this honor to
their King and Master the husband of their Niece, who in his life time was so
dear to them: but by their counsel and advice he was both by day and night
sent to be thrown into his Fathers tomb without any kind of pomp or
funeral sole^nitie, whereof arose a pretty quippe, namely that the King, who
was mortal enemy to the Huguenots, could him self nevertheless not choose
but be buried after the Huguenots manner. That which brought the Guisians and
their partakers to this point, was the assembly of the estates, where they
would needs assist for fear lest any thing should be decreed against the^,
also lest their absence should bewray to all the world the difference between
their furious and unlawful government, and that of the Princes of the blood,
of the Constable, of his eldest son Montmorency and of the brethren of
Chastillon: also lest by means hereof, the cause and root of the co^tagion,
which infected the common wealth should be cut of, which was the thing that
they feared more then the plague, for they saw that unless they took some
order, it would be known that them selves were the very causes and originals
of disorder. But which most troubled them, they had a woman to govern, whose
stedfastnes they did greatly suspect, by reason the Admiral was nere to the
young king her son, to whom she seemed to yealde as much as she could pass
withal, for the mollifying of the Princes and Estates. They douted also lest so
soon as their backs were turned to the Courtward, and that they had given over
the dealings in the affairs, there would come in infinite complaints, the
verifying whereof neither the Queen mother, neither other their friends could
deny, seeing that ye crime of treason walked to fast abroad. These occasions
therefore caused the Guisians to forsake and overthrow al good laws and usual
orders put in practice as funerals. The Cardinal sought to excuse him self by
the King of Navarre, and the Chastillons, saying that they had so concluded in
the counsel chamber, because there was not money enough to bestow upon so
charitable a deed, although the four score thousand frankes which he and his
brethren had gotten out of the money that came out of Poictou had been more then
sufficient: and in deed they were openly taxed therefore. For when Sansac and
la Brosse had brought the body unto S. Dionice, and there buried it without any
solemnity or royal ceremonies, two days after the burial there was found
pinned upon the velvet hearsecloth which covered his body, a little paper with
this writing, Ou est messire Ta^neguy du Chastel? mais il estoit Fra^cois,
signifying, Where is master Ta^neguy du Chastel? but he was a French man.
Hereat every man at the first did but laugh: but afterward thinking better upon
the matter, they found it to be other then it was taken for. This Ta^neguy was
charles the seue^ths chief chamberlein, and bestowed 8000. franks upon his
masters funerals, which he was not paid again until three years after: he laid
out this money when he saw that al me^ had abandoned his masters corpse, by
reason all the Lords had drawn to his son Lewis the eleventh, who was newly
entered into his kingdom, being as then in the low countries, whither before
through his fathers displeasure he was gone. This writing therefore was
interpreted as a lame^tatio^ made in the name of King Francis, seeing him self
forsaken and destitute of such a chamberleyn as Tanneguy was: and then saying
(as if he revoked) that Ta^neguyes good nature and duty was not so wonderful,
because he was a French man and no stranger: wherein the Author seemed to
note the Duke of Guise, because he had wrested the office of Great Chamberleyn
from the house of Longueuille.

Now have we seen the evil entry of the Guisians during the reign of
Francis the first, The Guisians behauiours in the time of Charles the ninth.
also how in the time of Henry the second, their ambition replenished al
Germany and Italy with blood, how their covetousness set to sale, as it were
to the most giver, the laws and all justice, how through infinite exactions
it emptied the purses both of rich and poor, whereof followed innumerable
calamities. Then how in the time of Francis the second, it was to be doubted
whether bare greater sway in them, either rapine or cruelty. True it is, that
the cruelty made the greater show, as we have already showed, and will again
hereafter. But in the time of Charles the ninth, the aforesaid vices together
with many more, also all their shadows of virtue did then as by day appear.
In this place comes into sight so many to true discourses, that I am eue^ in
a perplexity, not knowing which to take, the number of those which presently
do appear is so infinite. Of one thing I am sure, and that is this, that at
this day there is no French man, having any knowledge in worldly affairs, but
that he is able to make an other Legende of the particular acts of these
Guisians, in case he will take so much leisure as to gather together all that
he knows: wherefore I hope to be excused, although I do only set in hand
this work which requires both more hands and wits.

King Francis being dead, as is aforesaid, and the Cardinal when he was even
ready to give up the Ghost, having procured him to utter these words: Lord
forgive me my sins, and impute not unto me whatsoever my officers in my name
and authority have done: The Guisians minded to follow a new counsel, which
was to put of their lions skin, that they could no longer keep without
manifest danger of being drawn to flaying, and to put on the foxes case. Now
therefore they determined to follow their hunte through the Queen mothers
means: They promised her that if she will favor them, they will set to their
hands to keep her in the chiefest degree. Also the more to put this hammer
into her head, they do allege unto her, that the Princes through her
wincking at matters being so evil dealt withal, can do no less then wish
her harm, seeking all means to bring her down, to the end to set up the
Constable and the house of Chastillon, whereby afterward to make more
alterations: That the estates will disgrade her, unless she goes out at the
back door to meet them: also although then the Guisians were excluded, yet
have they so many servants and friends, that for a long while they could
withstand the Princes. In the mean time that she should retain her
authority, and that when her children should come to age, the government of
the Princes and their partakers should vanish away. The Queen being as crafty
as they, knew how to take hold of this proffer, and so to get in between both
parties, that bending sometimes one way, sometimes an other, to this present
she has kept the place, to the confusion of those who had thither lifted her.
Having thus found so good an attorney, who at once reconciled them to the King
of Navarre, and gave forth speeches that she would maintain the Guisians
against all their enemies and misreporters, they began somewhat to assure
them selves. Now therefore remained no more to do, but to beat down first
the Prince of Conde, who would not be handled as his brother the King of
Navarre, then Montmorency, and then the Chastillons. Hereupon came to sight the
goodlyest determination for their purpose in the world. They perceived the
number of Protestants still to increase in all parts of France, also that the
Prince of Conde and the Chastillons were openly of that profession, for the
Prince had made manifest declaration thereof, having caused Genly and others to
certify King Francis that he was so in deed. Yea even in the hardest time of
his affliction, he drove out of his chamber a priest, whom the Guisians had
sent thither to singe Mass. As for the Admiral, he had in the full assembly at
Fountainbleau presented their supplication to the King, tending to the end to
obtain some Churches and publik exercise thereof. He had also declared to the
Queen mother that he would never abjure his Religion, but offered to dispute
against the Cardinal. The lord d'Andelot had of long time been of the same
profession, and it is known that at the accusation of the Duke of Guise, and
by the soliciting of the Cardinal, the late King Henry had almost slain him,
when on a time he asked him if the Mass were good, and that he answered that
it was a profane and wicked thing. The Cardinal of Chastillon also began by
little and little to forsake the Papaltye. This then in their eyes seemed a fit
occasion to bend the Constable against both the Prince, and his own nephues
of Chastillon, the which they artificially afterward did, as shall be showed in
place convenient. They concluded therefore a while not to meddle with the
Religion, for (said the Cardinal of Lorraine) as yet there were none but
rascales of that profession, and therefore it were best to let some great and
welthy men also enter into it, to the end by their destruction to get some
thing.

Now in making war against the Protestants, they shot sundry ways with
own self arrowe: for first they obtained the favor of the Pope, the King of
Spain and others, of whom they looked for some help.

Secondly, they were assured that sundry of the best towns in the Realm, were
so deeply rooted in Popery, that it would be hard to pluck away their old
skin without good store of stripes, also that with the least stay in the
world, they would use all resistance possible.

Thirdly, they knew the Queen mothers disease, who would hardly permit her
children to be brought up in Religion, for her self was of none at all: also
that such countenance as for a while she might show, should be only to the
end to win the Protestants, and to set them against the Catholics, that
whiles they were the one sort bent against the other, her self might rule
all, and so that they should have no leisure to consider of or examine her
actions. They had also a number of secret servants, who to the end to rob
and make havoc of the Protestants goods, would become most Catholic. The
courts of Parliament also were so compounded, that unless justice were
reformed from the crown of the head unto the sole of the foot, the
Protestants should never prosper. Again, having through the Queen mothers
help the King and his brethren in their hands, they might easily under that
shield fight against all their enemies, and in time order them as they listed,
yea through their overthrow become mightier then ever before. But yet there
was one thing which troubled them, namely the prolonging of time, and the
inconstancy of the Queen mother, which the Duke of Guise more feared then any
other thing, together with the Prince of Condes liveliness: To remedy
therefore all this, they procured (as is before said) their atonement with the
King of Navarre, which was so brought about, that by the same means he
resigned to the Queen mother in presence of the Duke of Guise, and of the
Cardinal of Lorraine, all such right as he might pretend unto the regencye of
the King and the Realm, never to quarrel, demand or accept the same again,
and thereof gave them an acquittance sealed with his own hand.

Having thus gotten this poinct, they concluded that if the Prince seemed to
deal with them, he should have to do with so strong a match, as that soon
they should overcome him: also that this might be the means to bend his
brother against him, and so they should draw the one party to the Catholics.
As for the Queen, they determined a while to let her paunch some times one
way, and some times another, curiously watching to what end her behauiours
would come. Again, they were well assured that having this advantage over the
King of Navarre, she would so practice the estates, that her auctority should
be allowed of: also that them selves had such part in her, that her
inconstancy would turn to their commodity: also that before the year were
passed, they should see some stirringes, whereby to help them selves up again.

One part of that whereof they perceived some likelyhoode, came to pass: but
in the rest they were shrewdly deceived. For whiles they sufficiently tormented
the Protestants with four civil wars, and a horrible murder under Charles
the ninthe, five of them came short home, and the most doulte of all remained
behind, and as for the most apparent of their descent, who at this present is
Duke of Guise, he is in such estate, as (according to the proverb which
runs of such as are upon the sea) A man can not well say whether he be alive
or dead: for God has given him such a blow on the face, that he shall remain
blasted for ever. We must therefore consider what hurt they have done to the
King, his Realm, and them selves in all these civil wars: and as the
thunderclappes always before their coming do show by some tokens which go
before, their following to be at hand, even so the Guisians before that they
shot their thunderboults into France, gave forth certain deaf noyses,
practicing here and there, whereby to become more furious after that they were
once fortified. Being delivered of that which they most feared, which was the
researche for the Princes imprisonment, through such assurance as the Queen
mother had rooted in their hearts, also being reconciled to the King of
Navarre, having, as is before said, procured the King lately deceased, to
declare that he of his own absolute authority had caused the Prince of Condye
to be emprisoned: they determined to go to the estates, there to hear what
would be said, and so help their matters as much as might be possible. But
before they go any further, they enter league with the Cardinals of Tournon
and of Armignac, the Duke of Nemours, the Marshals of S. Andrews and of
Brissac, the lords of Rendan, Martigues, Sipierre, Monluc, la Motte Gondrin,
la Suze, Sanssac, Sauigny and many other lords and captains, who hoped to
become mighty, rich and welthy through the civil wars, which (said the
Guisians) the Princes would bring in, together with the alteration of the
Principality. The voice hereof caused they to be sounded in the King of
Nauarres ears, who in stead of providing according to his duty there against,
began to faint, and to resign all his authority, as anon we will more amplye
declare. Thereof ensued the order the one and twentieth day of December 1560.
established in the Kings council, touching the government of the estates of
the Realm: wherein the Queen mother was planted upright.

In the mean time happened a chance very agreeable to the Cardinal, but his joy
continewed not. The deputies of about forty baylywickes and Seneschaltyes of
the realm, alleged that their authority was out, because King Francis had
summoned them, and he being now dead, they must needs have new remembrances.
The Cardinal and his faction supposed that although this could not wholly
dissolve the estates, yet would it somewhat delay them, whiles in the mean
time they might practice some thing: but through the wisdom of the Chaunceler
and others, it was agreed that they should proceed, seeing that the royal
dignity died not but was represented in his successor. Also in case these
declaratio^s had delaied the estates, then had it gone wrong with the Guisians,
for in their new remembrances they also should have received new commissions.
The Queen mother also fearing lest they should smell out the writing, which
with threats she had wrested from the King of Navarre, and thereupon had
examined her doings, and corrected her as appertained, for working so
trecherously against the peoples liberty, hasted the matter forward, whereby
the Guisians got most.

They thereupon gessed that which was true, namely that at this assembly they
would deal in matters as well of Religion as of estate: they were also assured
that at that time Religion should be the chiefest, which greatly rejoiced them:
yea they determined with all their might to heave at that wheel, to the end
the other might remain undecided, or if necessity drive them to give account
of their administration, they intended to present up their reckoning in a
warlike field, there to be examined and proved at the swords poinct, wherein
they assured them selves to make so fair a broyle, that their wrongs together
with the rights of their adverse party, should there stray away together. They
must therefore earnestly deal in Religion, and with the same to cloye the
Huguenots, who with earnest affection, purposed no other matters but to think
upon the liberty of their consciences, accompting al bodily bondage somewhat
tolerable, so that the principal might remain in his full perfection. But yet
they were sore discontented: for the one could not consist without the other,
also Godliness without justice in this world has but a feeble foundation: as
there were some that said at the same time, that if the establishment of the
realm in her pristinate glory, and the reformation of Religion did not both
go together, we should yet behold and find greater mischiefs then before,
which experience has now taught to those who then would believe nothing, and
God grante that the French nation may in time learn.

This determination being taken, the Cardinal of Lorraine practiced al means
to have the charge of making the oration in the name of the three estates unto
the King, whereunto the Clergy did consent: and therefore did send one named
Griueau a Canon of the holy Chapel, unto the third estate for to obtain their
grant, but he had presently an open answer, that they would not accept him
to speak for them of whom they minded to complain: and upon this occasion, he
refrained from speaking to the nobilite, taking in the mean time such hold of
this answer, as thereby he might turn it to his own commodity: for he
assured the Catholics, namely the Clergy, that now the Huguenots would tread
them down, unless in time they withstood their determinations, and therefore
consequently they ought in the oration for the clergy, especially to stand
upon that point, for seeing the third estate had so detected it self, and
protested against him who was one of the principal members of the Apostolic
seat, they now would not spare the other smaler dependances. Hereupon the
Clergy chose for their speaker one named Quintin, a forsaker of the religion,
and at that time a doctor of the Canon Law at Paris. The nobility chose the
Lord of Rochforte, and the third estate, Lange an advocate of Bordeaux.

The estates ^t Orleans.
The estates began to be holden the thirtenth day of December, in a house
provided for the same purpose: Thither came the Cardinals of Lorraine and
Guise, also the Duke of Guise, to the end by hearing the oratio^s, to apply the
same so much as they might to their own commodities. The first day was spent in
hearing the Chancelers oration, which little or nothing touched them, for he
spoke but generally. The Deputy of the third estate stood upon taxing the
ignorance, covetousness and dissolutions of the Ecclesiastical persons, not
particularly touching any. Rochfort in the name of the Nobilitye did much
commend the delivery of the government unto the Queen mother, noted certain
abuses in the Clergy and Justices, and after that he had desired the King to
maintain the nobility in their privileges, he offered up a supplication,
wherein he desired some churches for the gentlemen protestants. Quintin on the
clergies behalf, made a long oration or inuectiue against the protestants,
joining against the mightiest, in covert words taxing the Admiral, who had
presented the supplication of them of Normandy which desired Churches.

These orations put the Cardinal and his brethren in good hope: for they
persuaded them selves that in case the estate of Religion went forward, as it
was very likely, the same would be the undoubted means to separate the
Constable from the Chastillons, and to make the Catholics strive against the
protestants: so in the mean time themselves would grow strongest.

In this thought chanced an other matter which somewhat served their purpose,
The Gui^^ans called accompte^
although the pursuit thereof were to them prejudicial. The deputies who were
appointed to visit the roules of the estates, having made their report unto
the privy council, the King of Navarre and the Chanceler to the covent of the
Franciscans, to speak with the estates there assembled, where they began to
talk of the restitutio^ of excessive gifts, of discharging the Kings debts and
such other like matters: but this could not be compassed before that those who
in the time of Henry ye second and Francis the second had had ye whole deali^gs
in matters of estate and in ye tresury, were reduced into great extremity. Of
this motion was the Queen mother very glad, as one assured that by reason of
her regencie, she should not be molested, and therefore determined to heave at
that wheel, thereby to pull down those whom she accounted to hie next her
own person. The King of Navarre had not meddled at al, but the Guisians, the
Constable, and the Marshal of S. Andrews were deepest in this matter: there
was therefore but one only remedy wherewith to break this blow, which was by
troubling the whole estate of the Realm. For the attaining whereunto, and for
the more commodious compassing of al things hereunto requisite, in stead of
proceeding in this point, God who justly was displeased, minding to begin to
scourge the French Nation, permitted them to remit the estates unto the month
of May next ensuing: which was the thing that the Guises especially sought for,
neither was the Constable any whit sorry, notwithstanding he had often
protested that he was ready to give up his accomptes.

The King of Navarre being yet somewhat affected unto the Religion, his brother
the Prince of Conde, and the Chastillons sought to advance the said Religion,
and that they might the better do, in case for a while they deferred dealing in
the other point, which shortly after they might nevertheless easily enough
take in hand again. But they were deceived through the ambition of the Queen
mother, the dastardlinesse of the King of Navarre, the practices of the
Guisians without the Realm, and the driftes of the Constable within the
kingdom, whom under color of Religion, they had separated from his nephues.

^he poli^es of the ^uisians, ^erewith bring the ^alme in^ trouble.
In this mean time the young King and his brethren were in the Queen mothers
hands, who only marked which side would be strongest, to the end to the same
to commit both her self and her children: and because she had suffered much at
the Guisians hands in the time of Francis the second, she could now have
wished that the Protestants might have been masters, being assured that she
could more easily have dealt with them: for she had already in her hands the
Chastillons. The King of Navarre suffered him self to be led every way, and as
for the Prince of Conde, in case she withstoode not the amends for such
injuries as he pretended through his imprisonment to have been done unto him,
she accounted him as hers, yea she looked to find in him a new staff
wherewith to suppress the Guisians. The Cardinal of Lorraine understanding the
Prince to be ready to come to the court, departed from the same under pretense
of residence in his Archbishoppricke of Reims, leaving behind him his brother
as a spy, and others to the end to practice according as matters might fall
out. After that the King had well received the Prince of Condie, and that in full
counsel he had justified him self, he was permitted to sue out more ample
declarations, and for the same purpose went to Paris. Soon after this fell an
other controversy, which much molested the Duke of Guise and his partakers,
yea, without the policy of the Queen mother, who at this time stood them in
good stead, and sought in time to come to aid her self, they had at the same
instant been quite unhorsed: for the King of Navarre through the soliciting of
some who saw meetly clear, did complain to the Queen of the too great
authority which the Duke of Guise took upon him, who at al times had been her
adversary: also that the said Duke of Guise continuing about the King, he
could not remain, and therefo^^ that it was expedient that either the one or
the other departed from the Court: after that the Queen had alleged some
excuses tending to the overthrow of this matter, the said controversy
proceeded so far, as that the next morning the King of Navarre put on his
boots, and was ready to depart, accompanied with the Princes of the blood,
the Constable, the Lords of Chastillon and many other great Lords. Now the
Queen seeing that remaining among the Guisians only, the world was at an end,
both of her self, and of them also: for her own conservation, fained to
procure their commodity, to the end in case they yet once again got the
masterie, they should not harm her. She sent therefore to fetch the Constable,
causing the King to command him not to depart, by the compassing whereof all this matter was broken of, and the King of Navarre sent to fetch back his
mulets, which already were gone as far as Melun.

This controversy being dispersed, raised a voice that the Queen maintained
the Guisians against the Princes of the blood: insomuch that the particular
estates of Paris proceeded and began to touch the chief points of the estate,
not forgetting the article of yelding up the accounts. The Guisians were
expressly named, with full determination to seek al means possible to forbid
them any entry into the privy council, before they had given up their
aforesaid accounts. The Queen mother of the one side greatly rejoiced in
seeing the Guisians her chiefest enemies by this means in danger. Again, on
the other side she was in some care as concerning her regencie. To provide
therefore against al inconveniences, she through the aid of the Constable made
a new agreement with the King of Navarre, in such wise as the said King was
pleased, and moved the Duke of Guise to counterfeit humility, which he now
more then usually did put in practice. She sent also for the Prince of Conde to
come and seal to this accord, and used the help of the Marshal of
Montmorencie, in amending and correcting all that had been concluded in the
particular estates of Paris, touching the government of the Realm.

The Cardinal dealt with the Queen mother in all these matters, to whom he writ
often, and notwithstanding each of them mistrusted other, yet had they so long
kept householde together, that the taking of this path seemed most necessary
for both their conseruations. And in deed we may well say that all the policies
of the Guisians did never stand them in so good stead, as did the only wit of
ye Queen mother, who nevertheless did mortally hate the^: but this shall be
showed in place more convenient. Here may we behold our poor king and
kingdom, swimming and waiting for present shipwreck, for ye co^passing whereof
the Guisians finding themselves to weak, under pretense of Religion do join
to their faction the Constable, provoking him against his nephue the Admiral,
who openly professed the Gospel, and so do aid themselves with all convenient
policies. The Marshal of S. Andrews also herein stood the^ in good stead: for
he did beat into ye Constables head, that whatsoever the estates had propounded
concerning the reuoking of excessive rewards, the Admiral had procured, to the
end to bridle his uncle the said Constable, and so to compel him necessarily to
consent to the alteration of Religion. The Earl of Villars being moved against
the Admiral for that he had reproved his evil demeanures in La^guedoc, did also
thrust at ye same wheel, so that notwithstanding whatsoever declaratio^s or
persuasio^s the Marshal of Montmorency could allege, yet did the Constable
join to the Guisians, who made their leagues to the intent by robbing the
King, and his realm of their faithful servants to bring al into confusion.

The Catholics finding the^ selves through such leagues fortified, began to
rise, Commotions of the Catholics
and thereupon through the policies of the Guisians, there was a noise raised,
that the Admiral had endeavored to expel the Mass, and to plant the Religion
in France without any ado. The Catholics therefore of Beauuais a
bishoppricke pertaining to ye Cardinal of Chastillon began, being followed by
the Catholics of Amiens, Po^thoise and other places. At Paris also were
Mu^kes, and such other trompets of sedition, who greatly advanced the Guisians
practices. In deed upon the first noise of these broils the Kings letters
patents were sent forth to al judges royal in the Realm, with strait defense
that no man should molest other by the name either of Papist or Huguenot,
whereby to provide for the surety and liberty of either sort.

The court of Parliament of Paris which consists most of the servants of the
house of Guise sent earnest declarations unto the privy council as touching
this Edict, but al was but a new practice whereby to shuffle the cards as we
say, and so to heap one discord upon another under the goodliest title in the
world, namely of Religion. In the mean time, the Cardinal waited for the young
King at Reims, who was brought thither to be anointed, whereas the Duke of Guise
was so presumptuous, as to step in between the King of Navarre, and the Duke
of Montpensier, so to march after the King, and by such sleyghtes to become
equal unto the princes of the blood. There the Cardinal finding his strength
sufficient, having won this point, to propound Religion as a cloak to his
ambition, did then grievously complain of the protestants, declaring that
during the parley concluded upon concerning the determination of these
controversies, the King ought not to permit any kind of innovation, and that
for the more assured provision thereagainst, it was requisite to make an
inviolable law: also to the same end to assemble in the Parliament of Paris,
the Princes, Lords, and others of the Kings privy counsel, there to frame an
arrest, which ever after should solemnly be observed. But all this was no other
saving a new policy whereby to hasten the practices of the house of Guise.
Now the Cardinal knew well that in this asse^bly of the Prelates for the
determination of matters of Religion, there would be nothing dispatched, also
that while things hung thus in suspense, the King should be called upon to
permit the exercise of the Religion openly: which being once granted, the
prince of Condye and the Chastillo^s would step in afterward to withstand him:
for the withstanding whereof, he supposed yt in preventing this parley through an
other assembly at Paris, where he had men enough at commandment, he might get
somewhat, or at the least so bend the one sort against the other, that him
self should lose nothing. This was the cause of the assignation of that
assemblye: whereunto the Queen mother agreed almost for the same
considerations, and the contrary parties in hope it would redound to the
commodity of the whole realm. Here may the readers consider what iourneys to
and fro the Guisians practiced as well within the realm as without, also how
they for their own maintenance removed both heaven and earth. The Spaniarde
and diverse Italian Princes were daily advertised of the estate of the affairs,
and then did the Queen mother stand the Guisians in stead of a secretary, to
the end to make out goodly dispatches in the Kings name against the Princes of
the blood, whom in the mean time they seemed greatly to favor. For at that
time, namely the 13 of June 1561. did the Parliament of Paris, all the chambers
being assembled in their red gowns in the great chamber of pleas, in the
presence of the Duke of Guise, the Cardinals of Lorraine and Guise with others,
pronounce their sentence concerning the innocence of the Prince of Conde: also
about the end of August following, was the atonement made between the said
Prince, and the Duke of Guise.

During these matters, The Edi^ of July.
the Edict of July was published in this assembly of the Princes and Lords of
the Parliament of Paris: whereby the Protestants enjoyed more freedom and
liberty, then ever before they had had. There was it again concluded, that
the prelates should be called, and the ministers of the Religion should have
safe conduictes to the end to seek some means of agreement. Then began the
Cardinal to hope well of his own matters, for he was sure to find a ready way
how to bend the Churches of the Confession of Ausbourg, against the reformed
Churches of France, by reason of the Supper. This being brought to pass,
besides that he should bring the ministers into derision, he should also hinder
the Prince of Conde and the Chastillons, who openly favored them, from all
provision to withstand such driftes and preparatiues, as the Duke of Guise and
his adherents began to frame, whereby to give up their accou^ts upon the spears
point, for so they might have no succor of the Germans, who would easily be
persuaded that al these troubles in the Realm proceeded only of Religion.

^actises to ^rthrowe (...) King of ^uarre.
The Guisians would feign have found some means so to bring the Prince of
Condie on sleep, that he might have been drawn from the Chastillons: But
their consciences did so reprove them, because of so many displeasures as they
had done unto him, that they left him, being sufficiently contented with
setting the Constable and others against him: Howbeit before they came to
handle blows, they deemed it necessary yet to strike one stroke more. They
perceived the King of Navarre and his brother the Prince of Conde to agree well
enough, and supposed (as it was most true) that so long as these two Princes
should continue in unity together, all the French nobility and communaltie
(notwithstanding Religion) would bend to them, to the end to expel the
Guisians, or else to bring them to accounts, and so consequently restore the
Realm to her pristinate brightness and dignity. They also persuaded ye Queen
mother how dangerous the union of these Princes might be unto her: she therefore
requested the^ to provide so much as in the^ lay, and promised of her own part
not to be slack in ye matter, as in deed she was not, but used such dishonest
means, as in the discourse of her government are at large set down. Now the
Guisians during ye reign of Francis the second had gotten to their service ye
Lord of Escars the King of Nauarres chamberlain, and through the same epsy
had discovered al his masters secrets, who finally having manifestly detected
the said d'Escars through certain letters which he had written, did for the
same turn him away. Then did he half bend him self unto the Guisians faction,
who sent him word to endeavor to come again into favor with his old master,
there to do the^ such service as before time, namely to entertain his said
master in all his pleasures, doing his messages unto ye Ladies of the court, and
so consequently withdrawing him from al Religion, which required an utter
abandoning unto al wantonness and abominations: thereupon so many men were set on
work, that finally the King of Navarre revoked the said Descars, whereat many
began to foresee great mischiefs likely to follow: and assuredly it is said
that the Cardinal of Lorrain hearing of this his calling again, began to
laugh, and as his custom was, clapping one hand within the other, said unto
diverse that he had not of long time heard any news that more contented him.

Ye have heard already how the estates holden at Orlea^s were proroged unto
May: The estat^ at Pontoise.
and afterward through diverse disturbances of such as intended to give no
account but on horseback in armor, they were adiourned unto the end of August
at Pontoise, where they had been appointed. There among other things which
touched ye Guisians, but especially the Duke of Guise there present, the
proposition of the lord Bretagne in his oration in the name of the third
estate, concerning the evil dealings of the said Guisia^s, did chiefly pinch
them: the words because they be notable, have we here set down. Your subjects
(said he speaking to the King) have been molested with infinite subsidies, both
ordinary and extraordinary, whereupon have ensued also, the augme^ting of
impost, the wages of fifty thousand footme^, the collations, the twenty
franckes upon every steeple in the Realm, the levy of eight crowns upon the
officers royal, six upon the advocates of the Parliament, four upon the
Burgeses, widows and artificers, two upon the rest of the advocates,
practitioners, notaries, and sergeants, borrowed and not borrowed, free holds,
new gains, money levied after the battle of S. Laurence, alienation of the
demaines, helps, gables, fines taken upon offices both old and new, the
suppressio^ of certain of the same, money for co^firmations, coin raised upon
houses and town houses, pay levied upon consignatio^s, vessels of gold and
silver billeted, warlike munitions, victuals for camps and armies levied
within these thirty years, horse and furniture of artillarie, erecting of sales
of wine, furniture, apparel, and food for soldiers, wages and pay for
soldiers in diverse particular towns, saultpeter and poulder which the people
must furnish, officers wages, men of arms and footmen unpaid, conduct money
into Bretagne, with other infinite su^mes under sundry names and titles, and al
tending to the getting of your subjects money: so that by reason of the said in
supportable charges, your pore subjects are so weakened, enfeebled and
impouerished, that at this present, Sir, they have nothing left to offer or
present unto your majesty, other the^ their good and faithful wills. They
often have examined them selves, and tried their whole abilities in your
majesty's affairs, but to their great grief they have found themselves
destitute of al means of helping or succoring you, and therefore do most
desire, that it may please you to defer and put of the succor which you at
this time do attend at their hands, until some other time, when through as well
their own diligence, labor, trauail, sparing and sobriety, as also through
such good entreaty as they hope for at your hands, they shall have recovered
part of their former ability and power. Neither can they be persuaded,
considering the great subsidies of them, leuyed during the reigns of the Kings
your late father and brother, that you can be so greatly endebted. Calling also
to mind, whatsoever all ancient histories or records as well holy as
profane, have left of al antiquity as testimonies of valiant deeds, they do
find that never any monarch, King or sovereign Prince has died indebted in
such excessive sums as did the late King Henry your Honorable father, how
long or continual wars the said Monarchs have sustained or enterprised, for
the augmenting of the bounds and limits of their realms and empires. And to
say the truth, so great and wonderful are the debts, that quite emptying all the treasuries of your dominions, and particularly researching every subject,
yet shall you hardely find goulde or silver in their possessions equiuale^t
unto the said su^mes. Which notwithstanding it seems very hard and
incredible, yet is the knowledge thereof more grievous unto your subjects,
because their power is not equal to their desires. This therefore has moved
them to conjecture that such great sums of money levied among your people,
never came wholly into your coffers, neither was ever converted to the
commodity of your predecessors, but through unreasonable gifts and such other
means, have in part remained in the hands of some particular persons, whose
houses do now triumph and flourish through the harms of your said subjects. For
the reparation therefore of such former government, also to prevent that in
time to come you fall not into any such bottomless pit of debts, they do most
humblye beseech you to ordeine that the treasurers and over seers of your
treasury, who hitherto have had the ha^dling and disposing of the same during
the reigns aforesaid, may come and bring in an account of their administration
before such delegates as your self shall choose, or through the assistance of
the estates every province and government shall name: by this means may such be
quailed and revoked to their duties, as in time to come might commit the like
trespass. Again one of the first articles contained in the roules which the
third estate presented, were these words. That such might bring in their
accounts as were accomptable, and had had the ordering of the treasurye, for
that the said third estate could not believe but that thereby sundry great
abuses might be found out: also that in the mean time as well such as were
accomptable, as also al other who had been dealers in the treasury, even being
of the privy counsel, might nevertheless be forbidden entry into the said
council, together with the execution of their said offices, until the said
accomptes were made other where then in the chamber of accounts, and in the
presence of the delegates of the estates, and that al restes and debtes were
paid. also that especial reuiew might be made of the accounts of those who had
received the particular loanes of the sommes of eight, six, four and two
crowns, the twenty frankes of each steple, the munitions and victuals, the
furnitures of the sales of wines and other necessary things for the wars, the
money levied upon the walled towns after the battle of S. Laurence, and al
other extraordinary pays levied upon the people. Also that al excessive
pensions and unreasonable gifts whatsoever might be revoked without exception
of any person, saving the Queen mother, (who had solicited the estates to
pursue these matters, for the causes rehearsed in the discourse of her
government) for that it was evident that this money had never been employed
unto such use as it had been destined unto, namely, the relieuing of the kings
affairs now may we well think whether these motions clawed the Guisians. The
Cardinal more stayed the^ his brother the Duke, made no show of ought, as if he
had sought to make ready his accounts. but in the others forhead a man might
read a thousand threats against the estate of the realm, the effects whereof
appeared within five or six months after. For their better providing therefore
for their own affairs, they determined as touching the giving up of their
accounts, that they would practice al means possible, rather then be brought
into any such necessity, also that in case under pretense of religion they
found no way, then would them selves endeavor to make one, by associating to
them their partakers, and so falling upon the Protestants, who they were
assured that the Prince of Condie, the Admiral and other Lords would defend:
and by this means they should so mingle these accounts, that together with
foreign succors they would exalt themselves higher then ever, and having this
fair pretense of religion, they consequently did assure themselves of the
favor of al Catholics. Moreover the Cardinal beholding such numbers of people
daily declaring themselves protestants, according to his wont, smiled in his
sleue, saying that this was the reward of the soldiers who had more need, and
a proper mean to content many both great and small, who sought naught but the
spoil.

The disputation also at Poissy between the ministers who were to treat upon
religion, and the Prelates who also were called to help to pay the Kings
debtes, was freely granted unto, which was in hope to move some controversy
between them and the Germans that held with the confession of Ausbourg,
either (peradventure because he accounted them ignorant, as he had every where
termed them so to be) to the end in so notable an assembly to astonish them,
either else with his prating, together with the sophistical reasons of some
Sorbonistes, who were sent for there to dispute, utterly to take away their
speches, and make them dumb: But afterward more deeply weying the matter, he
called to mind an other drift, which was to keep the Popes legate in a
readiness, to the end that if this disputation turned more to the protestants
advantage then he wished, he then might in time break of this assembly,
referring the ministers to the general council appointed at Trente: He also
minded thereby still to bridle the Queen mother, whose inconstancy the
Guisians greatly mistrusted, although wrongfullie, seeing that she was more
perfect in playing her part then them selves: although she communicated not
her whole mind unto them, but suppressed whatsoever she thought not convenient
for their aduauncemente. Now had they already shaken the King of Navarre, by
means of the Lord d' Escars: that wall must they therefore wholly pull down,
to the end that gatheringe up the stones thereof, they might with the same
stone the protestants, as afterward they did: Large promises were thereunto
requisite, wherein the Popes legate and the King of Spaynes ambassador, at
the Guisians suite did lustily set to their help.

As for the disputation at Poissy, The di^tation (...) Poissy.
in as much as the orations and discourse thereof is already published, and also
shall hereafter more largely be declared, we need not here stand long thereupon,
seeing also that hereafter we will cast out some word in discoursing upon the
Cardinals divinity and religion, and of his brave oration made in the same
assembly, the sixtenth day of September in the year of our Lord 1561. In this
place it shall be sufficient, to note certain of his policies against the
quietness of the Realm. First then to cause fools to think that the Pre^ates
were not thither assembled for nothing, he framed diverse articles touching the
institution of Bishops, the dignity of Cathedral Churches, and such other
like, but not mentioning any one point of doctrine: For they al were before
agreed not to yield any thing unto the ministers, for fear of being taken
for seducers, and so of making an irreparable breach in the dignity of the
Romish seat. In this wise did the Cardinal scorn the King and al his council,
who pretended to any reformation.

The ministers of the reformed Churches in the Realm, were willed to send
thither some of their fellows, and so they did, therein obeying the
commandments of the King and the Queen mother. Peter Martyr and Theodore Beza
were brought from Zurich and Geneua, where they professed divinity, to the end
more precisely to consider of al controversies. The Cardinal then seeing him
self to far shipped in matters wherein he was but a nouice, thought to
prevent it. So soon therefore as Theodore Beza was come, he went to him into
the Queen mothers chamber, where after certain talk he was forced to say to
the said Beza, that he was glad he had heard him speak, also that be hoped
they should well enough agree together. But this was but dissimulation, as the
Lady of Cursol at his departure showed him, saying, that for that night he was
become an honest man, but in the morning he would be turned: as more plainly
appeared in that his suppostes did publish abroad, that the Cardinal had
stopped Beza his mouth, and brought him to his opinion. But when the contrary
was seen in the oration of the said Beza, the Cardinal was so abashed, that
being among the Doctors and Prelates, he could not but say, I would to God
that that man, (meaning Beza) had either been dombe, or our selves deaf:
Thereunto perceiving that they must answer, it was thought expedient that a
Sorbonist named Despe^ce, an assured servant of the house of Guise, together
with certain others should pen the oration which the said Cardinal did
afterward pronounce, wherein nothing answering to the Ministers propositions,
they determined to stand upon two only points, namely of the Church, and of
certain questions thereupon dependinge: also of the Lords Supper: wherein he
did nothing, but plaster up certain sophistical syllogismes, and therefore I
thought it superfluous here to inserte the same oration, which more fitly may
be seen in the history of our time. After the end of this oration, followed
certain ample discourses of Despence, Saints, and other Jesuits and Monckes
whom the Ministers sufficiently answered. Now was the Cardinal glad to set
each party in a heat with other, to the end that the audience being vexed, all
might be referred to some conference either privately or in writing, whilst in
the mean time the Pope might send some new precept wherewith to stop the
Prelates mouths, who waited for nothing else: having for certain months thus
debated, when the Queen perceived that the Ministers and Prelates could not in
any one point agree, no not so much as in the article of worshipping of Images,
also that the Prelates and Doctors did not very well agree in the same poinct,
she brake up the said disputation, whereof the Sorbonistes were so glad, that
they could not refrain from showing a thousand tokens of friendship unto
Theodore Beza their principal enemy, out of whose hands they escaped better
then they hoped for: But the Cardinal had procured the Pope to write unto the
Prelates, that under pain of Excommunication, they should refer the
determination of such controversies unto the council of Trente, which came in
good time for those our masters who were then sore busied. As for the
confession of Ausbourg which was the trappe, whereinto the Cardinal hoped to
have brought the Ministers, they so wisely behaved them selves, that he
stumbled thereinto so that all the shame returned upon him self.

During these disputations, The Edi^ of Ianua^
the renowned edict of January was published by the advice and consent of the
chiefest and most notable persons in the Realm, and was the most convenient
way to appease the tumultes, and to reduce the estate unto his pristinate
beauty and renown: But the Guisians could not tolerate the same, because that
if all things had quietly succeeded in France, they should have been called to
their accomptes, whereof none was ready, except in leauying of soldiers and
foreine power, as well as of the Realm, wherein they trauayled as follows.

^f the Triu^^ ^irate, and ^e capitu^tion of the ^me.
We have here before seen how under pretense of Religion, there was a bar
laid between the Constable and his nephues of Chastillon, whereby the Guisians
might the more fortify them selves, and the sooner overthrow the said lords
of Chastillon, whom they hated and mightily feared. The Constable thereby
began by little and little to be offended with his said nephues, but especially
after he was certified that they together with the Queen mother, had been the
chief motioners of the estates to call for accomptes: for in them should him
self be examined, notwithstanding he were not by twenty parts so deep as the
said Guisians. Having thus won the principal officer of the crown, they
associated to them the Marshal of S. Andrews, who was as all men do know, one
of the most accomptable. Then took they counsayl among them selves, wherein
the Cardinal always used this policy, namely to propound Religion the better
to cloak his intents, and made this resolution. First that the superintendence
of al affairs should be committed unto the Catholic King, who should in the
beginning accuse the king of Navarre as a fauorer of a new Religion: and should
solicit him through fair promises to forsake all, and to take the
Catholics part: In case the King of Navarre remain obstinate, then should
the Spaniard, in continewing his glosing promises sometimes accompanied with
threats, in winter time raise soldiers, and then on a suddein set upon him.
Also if there they should find any resistance, then should the Duke of Guise
declare him self captain of the Catholic Confession, and so go and assail
the said King of Navarre on another side, who by that means should soon be
overthrown. The Emperor and Catholic German Princes, should be requested
to hinder the Nauarrians of all succor. The Catholics should retain the
Protestant Switzers: The Duke of Sauoye should assail and utterly root out
the Geneuians to the terror of all others.

Thus much touching the first poinct of their league. Now as for France, they
determined not to pardon any one who had been known once to have been a
protestante. The commission for the murder was allotted to the Duke of Guise,
who also had the charge of rooting out the whole race of the Bourbons, for
fear lest in time to come any one of their progeny should have revenged the
same murders, and restored the Gospel.

Then should they have raised war against the Protestant Princes, and have
lent the Emperor and the Catholic Princes all the money arising of the
confiscations of so many Protestants as should be murdered in France: and the
Cardinals, Bishops, and other holy fathers should be cottized to furnish the
expenses of this holy war.

These goodly articles did the Cardinal devise. And the Constable minding
nothing but his religion, was then so daseled, that he could not perceive that
notwithstanding his family were not named, yet the houses of Chastillon and
Bourbon being overthrown, his race could not continue. As for the Marshall of
saint Andrews, he was glad to see the accoumptes in this wise rendered, for
that in stead of restoring the most, because he had most received, he now
hoped upon a new receipt, and of never being coumptable for any thing: and
besides that the Guisians tended to the same end, they did moreover persuade
them selves at that blow to be bathed in all their enemies blood.

For the bringing therefore of these things to effect, the Guisians departed
from the Court about the end of November, manifesting their discontentation,
which sone after did more augment by reason of certain proceedings houlden
against the Duke of Nemours, whom they had procured to steal away, and co^uey
the lord of Orleans into Lorraine, where having him at their devotion, they
purposed to make him captain of their enterprise. For at all assayes, they
sought to have sundry strings upon one bow, because they yet knew not which
way the Queen mother would take. Howbeit thinking that in case the King of
Navarre would take their part, she durst not join with the Prince of Co^de
for fear of being displaced, they sought to bring their first purpose to
pass, by the aid of Destars and others, through bringing him into a vain
hope of being restored to his dominions. Whereunto the Pope (as said his Legate,
who was one of the chief solliciters of the matter) would assiste him, provided
always that the said King of Navarre would defend the Romish Church: the
effect whereof did sone appear, when the said King drove away the Ministers,
and revolted from the Religion: by reason whereof there fell out many doubts
about the publication and verifying of the said Edict of Ianuarye.

^e voyage Sauerne.
Not long before, the Guisia^s had written to the Duke of Wirte^berg, a
protestant Prince, requesting him to confer with them about the confession of
Ausbourg, wherein they showed some hope of a desire to be instructed. Upon this
cause they came to Sauerne not far from Strasbourg, where they had such
conference with the said Prince about the fiftenth of February 1561, that al of
them having protested to follow the doctrine of the said confession of
Ausbourg, and the Cardinal having for the same purpose co^ferred with Brentius
the Duke of Wirte^berges principal Minister, the Duke of Guise did finally
entreat this Prince that in favor of their Religion, he would so labor the
rest of the Protestant Princes, that in as much as in ancient time the house
of Lorraine still appertained unto the Empire, now in the same respect he and
his brethren might be aduowed for Princes of the same, bearing voice in the
Imperial diets: whereby they might withdraw and exempt them selves out of the
king of Fra^ces jurisdiction, hinder such succor as the Protestant Princes
might send to them of the Religion, and with the same to strengthen them
selves, and finally in stead of recompense, afterward destroy the same
Protestant Princes. As this Prince was at the point according to their request
to procure them to be received, news came into Germany of the murder of
Vassye, which the Duke of Guise had executed in his return into France from
the aforesaid town of Sauerne. The Protestant Princes greatly wondered
hereat, and that not without cause, seeing it was in manner scarce three days
between the time that the Cardinal gave with the one hand silver and gilt
cups to Brentius and other German ministers, and that now with the other
he sacked the Protestants. But they had before determined to come strongly and
armed into the city of Paris, and thence to the Court, to the end to be sure
both of the town, and of the King and Queen mothers persons, and so the more
easily to compass their conspiracies. And to the end to find some honest
cover for the Duke of Guises return into France, he caused the King of Navarre
to call him home: howbeit he could not temper his rage until he came to the
Court, but did discharge the same upon the inhabitants of Vassye, as is before
said, being guarded with men of arms, according to a determination concluded
upon above three months before, namely that every man should entise as many
Gentlemen and men of arms as was possible, warning them to meet in their
furniture nere unto Paris, about the beginning of March, whereof the Queen
mother and the King of Navarre had been sufficiently advertised, and yet instead of providing thereagainst, they deferred their matters from day to day,
so that each played his part after a strange manner, and al in one tragedy.
The Duke of Guise met at the time appointed at Nantueil, where other his
fautors did soon meet with him, whose purpose a man may easily conjecture, in
that most of them coming thither there received their Easter rights, and put
them selves in such estate, as like men do use to do when they think them
selves nere unto any dangerous enterprise. In the mean time, the Queen
mother was counseled that for the eschewing of these troubles, it were meet
to keep the Duke of Guise (being armed contrary to the Kings ordinances) from
passing through Paris, where the Provost of Merchants and other of the
principal did wait for him: whereupon she diverse times sent for him to come
to her unto her house at Monceaux, where he should be welcome, expressly
forbidding him all entry into Paris in such array, for the avoiding of such
inconveniences as she foresawe likely to ensue: considering also the execution
and slaughter lately by him committed at Vassy, for the which all men earnestly
cried upon the King and her for justice, and in respect of the same, all the
realm was replenished with complaints and lamentations. Hereunto the Duke of
Guise answered, that he could not come to her, for that he had enough to do
to feast and to welcome such his friends as were come to visit him. Then after
that the Queen had the second time written to him to come, he made no answer,
but having received his friends, did according to the resolution before taken
touching their enterprise, take his journey on the one side, and accompanied
with his adherentes, came into Paris by S. Dionice gate, making his entry in
open armor, in which order he had still marched even from the murder at Vassy.
The Provost of Merchants and three of the Counseylours of the city assisted
him in this entry, with great companies of people, and exclamations of men
thereunto hired, even as if the Kings own person had been there, crying alowd,
Live Lord of Guise, whereat neither he, neither any of his company showed any
token of discontentation. (...) begin^ of the trou^


The Guisians having struck this first stroke against the Kings authority,
and the estate of the Realm, proceeded on, and in Paris began to hold
private councils. Hereupon the Queen mother lying at Monceaux, and having
daily aduertisementes, that the Guisians intended to sease upon the Kings
person and her, determined hastily to depart and retire into some place of
assurance. She came therefore to Melune, minding to get to Orleans, there to
wait in broader day light, to see how matters went, which now began to come
to great confusion: But the Guisians sent the Provost of Marchantes to cry
after her, that unless she returned, Paris and all was lost, because the
Prince of Co^de was in arms, and the Parisians naked: and he so labored, that
the rebels had their weapons delivered them, whereby to fortify the Duke of
Guise and his faction against their enemies, and so to have the redier
opportunity to sease upon the Kings person. Also the more to hasten their
work, they got the King of Navarre unto Paris, for this Provost of Merchants
incessantly cried out at the Court, that the King of Nauarres presence was most
necessary in Paris, to repress the troubles, but through the Guisians driftes
al was contrary. For so soon as he was come, they held councils more
narrowly then before, wherein among other things they determined, thoroughly to
assure them selves of Paris, and thence to drive away the Prince of Co^de, as
the only hinderer of their enterprise, touching the seasing upon the King and
Queen mother, and their bringing to Paris, to the end there having the^ at
commandment, to prosecute under their name and authority, their whole
determinations. Finally, they did so much that they got the place, and took the
King and Queen mother, and brought them to the Louure: This done,
notwithstanding whatsoever the cha^celers and others declaratio^s, it was fully
concluded to arreare open war against the Prince of Co^de and his adherents.

During these matters, the Prince of Conde sent to the King his protestation
and declaration, containing the causes that had moved him to take weapon,
namely to the end to restore the King and his mother to their full liberties,
and to maintain the Edictes, but especially the last which touched Religion:
offering to go home to his own house, in case the Duke of Guise would do the
like. Now the Cardinal of Lorraine, his brethren and their adherents,
considering that now there were two especial points which they must needs
craftily cloak, namely the Kings captivity, and the breaking of the Edict of
January, did diligently procure the dispatch of a declaration bearing date the
eight of April, wherein they cause the King to confess that the report of his
captivity is a false and slanderous lie, which the Prince of Conde and his
partakers have invented to excuse his own dealings, and that he and the Queen
were in as free liberty as ever before, also that of their own accord they
came to Paris, there to provide against these troubles. These letters were
soon allowed in the Parliament of Paris, where were many of the Guisians
creatures. The playnlier also to scorn the King and all the realm, they
invented in their opinions an other crafty devise, for within eight or ten
days after these letters, they procured others, wherein it was declared that
the Prince of Conde under a false and feigned pretense of Religion, was
personally seized upon by certain seditious persons, who had him now in their
possession.

Also to the end to have one full blow at the Edict of January, they in the
same month dispatched other letters, wherein in the Kings name they gave out
that he had been advertised, how that diverse numbers of people were retired to
Orleans and other places, under color of a certain pretended fear of being
searched in their consciences, and restrained from the benefit of the Edict of
January: He therefore declares that he intends not to revoke this Edict
except within Paris, the suburbs and bayliwicke of the same, where he will
permit no other exercise then of the Romish religion. These letters being
repugnant to the Edict of January, were presently received and allowed in the
Parliament.

^he first ^oubles.
This done, the Guisians having first used the Co^stables aid to strike a
stroke in Paris, and the^ the king of Nauarres help to drive away the
Protestants, did now send out the Marshal of S. Andrews on the one side,
who executed cruelties sufficient, and them selves on the other side gathered
power every where, took the fields and used terrible deeds of hostility
against the Protestants. We will therefore in this place only briefly run
over matters, for it is enough to touch them only by the way, referring the
ample discourse unto the history of our time. First therefore they used the
help of the Queen mother, of the King of Navarre, of the Parliament of Paris,
and of their own secret servants in the quayling of the Prince of Condies
constancy, and separating him from the Lords of Chastillon, whom they minded
first to overthrow. But getting naught that way (for he had discovered their
embushments, and had both in the Realm and abroad fortified him self against
the same) they now proceeded unto violence, murdering the protestants in diverse
towns of the Realm, and with incredible violence assaulting certain places,
whither the said Protestants had for their own safeties withdrawn them
selves. And although the King of Navarre were in name Lieutenant general, and
that the Constable remained in his estate, yet did all things pass through
the Guisians hands, who in small time raised all the realm into arms.

Then the Constable, the Marshal of S. Andrews, The triu^ ^uirates r^queste.
and the Duke of Guise presented a request to the King and Queen mother,
therein requiring the utter abolishing of religion, the exercise whereof had
four months before bin granted, That all officers of France, the household
servants of the King, his brethren and sister, all officers of justice, war,
accounts, excheker, treasury, and others bearing office, having charge,
administration or commission from the King, should profess the same religion,
and thereof make open declaration: and that al such as refused, delayed, or
withstood the same, should be deprived of their estates, charges, offices,
wages, administrations and commissions. That all Ecclesiastical persons should
do the like, under pain of deprivation of their benefices. That all temples
which had been razed, should now be new built, and satisfaction made for all
damages, and the pullers down of them punished. That all weapons taken without
the King of Nauarres express commandment, should be laid down again, and
that all men persisting in the bearing of them against the will of the said
King of Navarre, the Lieutenant general representing the Kings person in all
his Dominions, should be declared rebels and enemies to the King and his
Realm. That it may appertain to the King of Navarre only, to keep and
assemble power in France, and the same to retain certain months for
appeasing of the troubles. This done, they promised every man to go home to
their houses, yea (said they) even to the end of the world into perpetual
exile, if need so required. This did they the fourth day of May 1562. The same
day they procured the King to command them not to depart from the Court, and
therefore presented an other request to the Queen mother, therein offering to
go home to their houses, to the end (said they) to obey the King of Navarre.
Unto these requests did the Prince of Conde sufficiently answer, who largely
discovered the sleights of the Guisians, and did daily fortify him self, as
well by his authority in this point, as also by certain letters which the
Queen mother wrote unto him, committing to his safegarde the mother and the
children, and openly enough condemning the tyranny of the Guisians.

It is hard to say, whether the policies or violences of the Guisians did most
harm: and as for the cruelties which their soldiers exercised in sundry
parts of France, especially the men of war, together with some murderers in
diverse towns, the posterity will wonder more in reading the history of the
year 1562, then we who were the beholders of such horrible tragedies, as the
Cardinal and his brethren played to the confusion of King Charles and his
kingdom. For in their behauiours they used some sleightes needful to be
marked. The Prince of Condies troops were well armed and resolved to fight,
being compounded of the most valiant French Lords, Captains and soldiers.
The Guisians therefore doubting the trial, hoped by their iourneys to and fro
to disperse his army, wherein the Queen mother and the King of Navarre were
employed. In the mean time, they daily surprised some places which the
Protestants held, gathered up money, and called strangers out of all
countries to the spoil, and seeing themselves at the point to be beaten,
about the end of June through the aid of the King of Navarre they obtained
truce, and within two days after, the Duke of Guise departed from the camp at
Baugencie with diverse others, whereupon they immediately sent the Prince of
Conde word, that according to his request the Duke of Guise and his partakers
were returned to their own houses. Now was the Queen mother instructed what
communication she should use toward the Prince of Conde and the rest of the
protestants: as did manifestly appear in a letter which the Duke of Guise
wrote to his brother the Cardinal of Lorraine, dated the 25. day of June,
which being surprised, to the end the playnlier to set forth these good
peoples wits, I have here inserted as follows. I do send unto you (writes
he) this bringer with all speed, to let you understand, that yesterday al
things were agreed, and I may say unto you, that some are far wide of their
accomptes. Our mother (the Queen) and his brother (the King of Navarre) swear
no other but by the faith that they owe us, also that they will take no
counsel but of those whom you wot. To conclude, the reformed Religion, in
well governing our selves, and standing stiffly unto the end, as we will do, will
come to naught, and the Admirals party be as evil handled as it possible. Al
our power remains whole, and theirs is broken, and their towns yielded,
without any speech of either edictes or preachings, or administration of
Sacraments after their manner. The next day after the Duke of Guises and his
partakers departure, the Prince of Co^de went to submit him self in ye hands of
his brother the King of Navarre and of the Queen mother at Baugency, passing
through the midst of the Guisians army to ye great danger of his own person:
The Queen mother being come to Talsy a village hard by, did there sufficiently
give to understand to the Prince of Conde, the Admiral and other Lords whom
she had sent for thither, that her self was the Guisians assured instrument,
whereby to mainteyn and support troubles and partialities in the realm. For she
told them flatly, that they must not look to have the edict of January
observed, neither that in France should be any other religion used then the
Romish, also that the Catholics were so strong and therewith so chafed,
especially at Paris, that without further tumults the said edict could not be
kept: wherefore they ought to be content in being tolerated to live quietly in
their own houses, without any slander or being searched in their consciences,
provided always that they practiced no preachings, administration of the
Sacraments, or other exercises of their religion. The Guisians also remembering
how diverse times before, the said Prince of Co^de and his adherents had
declared (which language they now also used unto the Queen) that rather then
for their parts to agree to the forcing of their consciences, or to tolerate
any thing contrary to Gods honor, or his word, they would depart the realm,
and incur perpetual exile, did now expressly advertise the Queen that at
this parley she should reduce the^ again to the same communication, and then
take the^ at their word, which she both promised and diligently brought to
pass. For having declared to the Prince and his partakers, that their
protestations touching the maintenance of the edicts and religion were not
receyueable, she did very liberally yield to the other point, namely that their
best was to withdraw them selves out of France, promising to procure unto the^
as well generally as particularly, al such letters of assurance as the^ selves
would devise: then acco^pting her self assured of their departure, she began to
discourse with the^ upon the time when the king should come out of his nonage,
showing them yt there were some who threatened to continue it unto the twentieth
year of his age, notwithstanding she were determined at the four tenth year to
proclayme his maioritie: alleging that she assured her self that in case any
man sought therein to contrary her, the said Prince and the rest would not
fail, but come to her aid and assistance. Yet was she not content so
accursedly to maintain both the Guisians and her own ambition, but that she
must needs the same night after she came from Talsye, dispatch Ramboillet, to
the end in the morning to be at the said Princes vprising, to haste^ the
departure of him and his, and to bring her word of the assured hour and time
of their said departure out of the Realm, writing unto the said prince, that
she would send him ten thousand crowns to what part soever he went, therein
manifestly declaring her self the instrument of the said Guisians wherewith to
banish him: so that hereby every man may perceive what way poor France was
like to go through such accursed government.

The Prince hereupon returned with such lords as acompanied him into his own
ca^pe, having first reueiled to the Queen mother certain of the Guisians
practices, whereby they endeavored to have apprehended him in his return from
the said parlye, which he had discovered. But all this notwithstanding, they
were so wide from quayling his constancy, that contrariwise being fully
resolved to maintain the liberty and laws of his country, and to do his
duty unto God and the Church against the enemies, he twice offered them
battle. But the Duke of Guise and his friends (who so greatly before trusted
in their power, knowledge and experience, as to presume to say, even before the
Kings face, that with three hundred men of arms they would not fail, but so
beat the Huguenots, that for their safety they should have enough to do,
quickly to get into the corners of the Realm) then with all the power that
they could get in seven or eight days, together with such forces as they
gathered under the Kings name and authority, could not now otherwise shifte,
but by stealing away and in the night departing unto Bloys, a town of no
strength, where they found the poor inhabitants utterly disarmed, of whom some
they murdered, and some they drowned, violating women and maidens, and
committing wonderful havoc: and thence, having that passage open, they went
and sacked sundry other towns, and forraged a great part of the Realm. The
Cardinal also together with the Popes Legate followed the army to the army,
whereby to prevent all means of agreement, and to maintain the troubles,
whereof we need no more assured proof then of a certain remembrance which at
the same time was met withal, which the said Cardinal sent to his brother the
Duke of Guise and his companions, to the camp at Bloys by Seure the controuler
of his said brothers houshoold. This remembrance among other did contain these
words. As for breaking of or hindering whatsoever is newly propounded touching
agreement, it is that that is the hardest, and contains most labor: and
never believe that any man takes any heed thereto, or hearken unto them,
either that they shall come to any poinct, unless they submit them selves to
such offers, as the Queen says she has made unto them. Afterward he adds
saying, As for continuing about the Queen, that is done: and all diligence is
employed according to the instructions, without omitting any hour or
occasions, and so shall be continued. Concerning the Pope, those be so long
delays that we can come to no end, neither is there any defaulte of calling
upon, yea even of angring outright. Touching the succors of Flanders, we
perceive nothing ready without long attent, and yesterday the Ambassador was
spoken unto, who, says he, has done his endeavor in writing to the Lady of
Parma. For Meaux, we have not power sufficient to do any thing, and therefore
we seek to get them to yield. In any wise forget not Man's and Bourges, and see
that after your departure from where ye are, you be not new to begin. The
declaration of rebellion was yesterdaye red in the council, and well liked of
all men. The Kings men penned it, and it should this day have been published:
But they say they have promised to do nothing without you, and therefore do
send it to you to add or diminish. Time wastes, send it therefore back
again speedily.

This declaration of rebellion had the Cardinal practiced, thereby to break
the Prince of Condes power, The C^nall pr^reth the be pro^med re^ who do^
withsta^ his pr^ses.
and so with more ease to attain to his purposes. The arrest thereof was
published in the Parliament of Paris, the 27 day of July 1562. But the Prince
and his partakers did first refuse the Guisians slaves, who prepared them
selves to make this declaration, and then utters the injustice of the same,
whereby the Cardinal got not much that way, saving that he detected his own
practices and rebellions, as the said Prince and his confederates published in
their declaration to the Queen, wherein were these notable words among other.
Considering with a single eye the parties in this cause, ye shall find that
the said lord Prince and his confederates, have been wrongfully declared
rebels by those who are so in deed. The procurers of all the troubles
happened in this Realm, since the death of the late King Henry, are the
declarers of the said Prince and his fautours to be seditious. They who do
oppress the Kings majesty, abolish his decrees, and abuse his name and
auctority, to the end with his overthrow to establish their own mightiness,
are the same who have declared us guilty of treason. Those those are guilty of
treason against God, whose works have alweys showed that ambition is their
God, covetousness their religion, and worldly pleasures their paradise and last
felicity: who have sworn war against the Son of God, his word, and the
defenders of the same: who show the deeds of Anabaptists, in rebaptising
children baptized according to the ordinance of JESUS CHRIST: whose houses are
replenished with theft, and their hands bloody in all crueltye. Those men
also are guilty of human treason, who have violated the Kings edictes, armed
them selves contrary to his commandment, and seized upon his royal person:
who are inward friends, and to the same end do use the help of those, who
in seeking to steal away the second person of the Realm, endeavored to
oppress the King, and to bring his estate into ruin and confusion. And seeing
we must needs proceed, I say that those men are guilty of treason, who lately
made a conspiracy in Prouence through the aid of Lauris a president in the
Parliament of Aix, together with Fabritius Cerbelone the Popes governor of
Auignon, te^ding to the raising of fiftenth thousand men, who as they swear,
marched at the commandment of the Duke of Guise, of whom the said Fabritius
furnished a thousand footmen, and two hundred horse: which conspiracy being
detected, and in the court of Parliament of Prouence, verified: Entrages and
Laydet the two chief captains of this faction were beheaded by sentence of
the said court. If this be not sufficient, I will say yet more, namely that the
Guisians made the like match in Dauphine by means of captain Mantil: hoping
to arm the said two provinces, and then to cause them together to march where
they thought best. So that these conspiracies made for the abolishing of the
preaching of the Gospel, these leauyings of men, and this oath, to march at
the Duke of Guises commandment, do cry out that he and his confederates are
rebels, seditious persons, and guilty of treason against both God and man: Also
that contrariwise, those are the Kings true and faithful servants, who both
have and still do valiantly withstand their rebellions, seditions, and attemps
against the Kings majesty, and the estate of this Realm. Also hereof above all
that is yet spoken, the overthrow of the policy, and subversion of the justice
of this Realm, together with the perverting of the court of Parliament of
Paris, may be a sufficient testimonye: The aid of which court they have used
in this false and pernicious judgment of rebellion, because they could not
light upon any other company so corrupted and depraved, either so much bound to
their wills and appetites as is the same: for so many as now be members
thereof, either do keep their rowmes through the said Guisians and their
adherents favor, or else do live in hope hereafter through their help to clime
higher: yea most of them are by name comprehended in the said conspiracy and
league, which the said Guisians and their adherents have made.

Thus you see what was then published against the Guisians: The Card^nals
polic^ for the ma^^taining of his Tyra^^
But unto this policy of causing the Prince of Condies adherents to be
proclaimed rebels, the Cardinal yet added other sleights. First he got the King
and the Queen mother to be brought into his brothers camp by the King of
Navarre, whom he sent to fetch them: and so caused both the Child and mother to
march as it were in triumph, the better to cloak the end of this war.
Secondly he won to their part al strangers, eue^ the Protestant Germains,
whom he caused to enter into the Realm, and in the mean season scoffed at
the said Protestants religion: because, said they, that with money they brought
them to root out the gospel in France, which them selves had planted in
Germany, which also they still professed. yea the better to scorn the said
Germans, the Guisians gave them to understand, that of long time they had
been minded to establish the confession of Ausbourg in France, (which the
Cardinal had openly detested in the assembly of Poissy, notwithstanding that
afterward at Sauerne he protested that he did allow of the same) and already
had so done, in case they had not been let by the Prince of Condye and his
adherents, whom they charged to be rebels, to seek to usurp the crown, to be
Anabaptists, Atheistes, and men deuoyd of al faith and religion.

All this time in France there was no news but of te^pests and horrible
confusions throughout all the Country, The Car^^nal goes the Coun^
as more largely is, and shall be discoursed upon in certain treatises tending
to the same end: but the Cardinal endeavoring to assure his matters as well as
he might, determined to leave his brethren at work in France, whiles him self
went to practice with the Pope, the Spanierd and others assembled unto the
Council of Trent, and all under color of religion, which he did openly scoff
at: for at Gyen and Bloys among other the articles whereunto he caused the King
and his council to subscribe, to the end they might (said he) pass in the
Cou^cil, though in effect to bring the Pope and his adherentes to that whereat
he shot, were these five, wherein his practices may plainly be perceived. First
that the Canon of the Mass might be cut of, and the rest corrected according
to the form of al ancient liturgies, and brought into French. Secondly, that
the Psalms might be sou^g in Churches after the manner of that French
translation which the doctors of Sorbone had corrected, who in deed are as
rude Poets, although they love their drink well, as evil divines. Thirdly,
that indifferently al men might participate in the Lords Supper under both
kinds. Fourthly, that al flat paintings tending to the story only, should be
permitted in Churches, and al Images taken away: or at the least wise the
people should be exhorted not to worship any of the^ either simply or by
relation. Fifthly, and finally, that all curates and priors should either by
them selves or by others interpret the epistle and gospel for the day unto the
people. Thus did this troublesome member handle France: who was against al men
and al men against him, yea even in Rome the Cardinal Vitelly did sharply
rebuke him, calling him a busy fellow and molester of al things, who only by
his driftes cut out more work in a day, then the whole consistory of Cardinals
could sow in a year. The better to frame his ginnes, he got forth with him
nine bishops, four Abbots, and certain Sorbonistes, and arrived at Trent in
November 1562. whereupon the twentye third day of the same month he made an
oration containing some matters worth the noting.

First he confessed that Gods wrath over France proceeded of the corruption of
manners in all estates, and the utter despising of all Church discipline. About
the midst speaking of the King of Frances request, this good orator said, He
requires us, so much as we may, to avoid al new quarrels, to omit al new and
unfruitful questions, to our power to procure all Princes and countries to
absteyne from wars, that we eschew al desire of moving debate, for doubt
least such as have strayed from us should account this council to be holden,
rather to the end to stir up princes to take weapon, also to make complots
and alliances of wars, notwithstanding it were holy, then to provide for the
universal reconciliation of minds. Afterward he makes mention of the
reformation of the church, and does conclude with his own submission to the
Romish Church. Now let the reader consider the purpose of this speech. And from
that time forward he still practiced against the estate of the realm, from
whence he daily received letters, neither was there any thing in France done
without him, as hereafter we shall perceive. But being now in hand with the
council, we will also touch some leagues. Immediately after he heard of the death
of his brother the Duke of Guise, upon whose auctority his whole hope was
grounded, he suddenly thought never to return into France, but with his usual
inconstancy turned his mind toward the affairs of Italy, gratifying so
far forth as he could, the Pope and al forreyn princes, especially the
Catholic King of Spain.

Before the news of this death, he had with the Spanish Bishops stood stiffly
in defense of residences upon benefices against the Popes dispensations,
alleging them to proceed of the Law of God: but then he sone changed his
copy, mainteining with his adherents that they belonged to the positive Law,
and so through the plurality of voices bare it away, in so much that the
Archbishop of Granado cried out, that the Cardinal of Lorraine had betrayed
them. Also when the County de Luna the King of Spaines ambassador slacked his
coming to ye Council, because he disdained to sit under ye French ambassador,
ye Cardinal procured him to come, and to the end to curry favor with the King of
Spain, caused his ambassador to inioye the more honorable place, thereby
causing the King of France to lose the preeminence, which never before was
called into question.

The siege of Bourges and Rouen.
Now let us mark whether his brethren, whom he had left in France, were any
truer servants to the crown. The Duke of Guise kept the King and Queen mother
in his hands, making them to trot up and down, also to be present in the
taking of towns, and so hiding him self under their authority stroke his
blows. For the King of Navarre he did strangely scorn and floute. Well, in
August he besieged Bourges, and in September they yielded, then did he cause the
King and Queen to enter, and used marvelous threats and outrageous words
against them that were yielded. All the Protestants in those quarters did he
worse entreat then either Turks or Jews. The Duke of Aumale, and Marquise
d'Ellebeufe lay in Normandy, the one before Rouen, and the other before Caen,
and yet notwithstanding they wanted neither grease nor growing, yet could they
not greatly profit that way. The Lord of Moruilliers was at Rouen, and in S.
Katherines fort was so good a garnison, that the Duke of Aumale al summer time,
did naught but lose men and munitions. Yea, the parties besieged, the more to
laugh at him, erected certain rampires and bulworkes, against the which he
wastfully spent his powder and pellets, as if he would have scared sparrowes.
To be brief, every man was a master in his camp, insomuch as when a certain
boy was gotten out of Rouen to behold, and epsy the demeanours of him and
his, seeing every royster intrude him self to counsel him and to command in
his presence, at his return said, that there were very many captains, but
few soldiers: wherefore, said he, you are in no danger except when the Lord
of Aumale sleeps. In the mean time the Duke of Guise called in all strangers,
as Italians, Spanierds and other, the more to trouble al things: But hearing
that the Queen of England prepared to aid the Protestants, and knowing her
landing to be in Normandy, he led thither his army, drawing with him the King
and Queen mother together with the King of Navarre, who at the siege of Rouen
received a wound whereof he shortly after died, being therein rewarded for
joining with the enemies both of the crown and of his family. Rouen was
taken, and al extremity therein exercised. That done, the Duke of Guise
returned to Paris in great perplexity, for that the Prince having received
succor out of Germany, was coming to seek him. Howbeit in the mean time he
received new supplies of Gascoynes and Spanierds, and therewith intended to
keep the Englishmen from joining with the Prince.

Hereof followed the battle of Dreux fought in December, the effect whereof
al men do know. The battai^ of Dreux.
But as the Duke of Guises refusing to give the onset when the Constable sent
him word, which caused the said Constables taking, procured men to judge that
willingly he sought this chance, so did others who supposed better to know his
nature, attribute it to his cowardlines: and thereof did men take their
argument, to assure them selves of all that which since that battle this brave
warrier has compassed. For all men will confess that after this battle of
Dreux, all the Protestants power consisted in the band, which the Admiral kept
in the fields, and not in the city of Orleans which was impregnable, for the
said Admiral remained safe. And therefore it had been reason that the Duke of
Guise had assailed him, who being overcome, Orleans would have stretched forth
her hands: and not in such wise to have wasted his men, money, munition and
forces, about the taking of a town, which being won and razed, should but
have made the Admiral more strong, wary and diligent about new and dangerous
enterprises. Thereof did men conclude that the Duke of Guise wanted both wit
and courage, in that he neither could, ne durst follow the Admiral at his
retire out of Normandy, but did suffer him so to fortify him self with
towns, holds, fortresses, men, money and al other munitions. Yea, the most
valiant and expert captains of France do think certainly, that in case ye
war had a little while longer continued, the Admiral had given the Duke of
Guise an immortal reproach, who at Dreux durst not look in his face, neither at
his coming out of Orleans to go into Normandy, follow at his back:
notwithstanding the said Admiral was but slenderly accompanied at his coming
out of the said besieged city, and yet passed part of France, and even before
the said Duke of Guises face forced certain towns, as Touque, Caen, Falaize,
Argenten, Vire and other places in Normandy, took sundry fortresses and
castles, and compelled the Marquise d' Ellebeufe to come under the yoke, and
yield to his grace and mercy, notwithstanding the said Marquise might well
enough have withstood him, as having an vnpregnable place, namely the castle of
Caen at commandment: But that was not his occupation, he was fitter to handle
a bottle and a gambon of bacon. And in deed not long before the Admirals
coming to Caen, he sought to flee, and had not Captain Renouard been, he had
never abidden the summons. Of him therefore did not a gentleman of Caux speak
much out of the way, when as after the first troubles, at the same time that
the Kings army feared, that it would be long before they could recover New
haven, he counsayled them to cause the Marquise d' Ellebeufe to enter
thereinto: for, said he, there is no forte so strong, so well defended or so
impregnable, but that he immediately will yield the same.

In the mean time, the Cardinal hearing of the battle of Dreux, said, Al is
well seeing my brother is escaped. Is there no more talk of calling us to
accounts? and then turning unto two bishops of his familiars, he said to them
smiling, So far as I perceive, my brother must take his accounts, him self
alone: now is it as I desired. The King of Navarre was dead, The Marshal of S.
Andrews was slain, the Prince of Conde was prisoner on the one side, and the
Constable on the other: now was it as he desired. Now did he and his brother
fear none but the Queen mother, whose inconstancy and subtilties they were
to conquer. To the attaining therefore to their purpose, they thought it
necessary to get Orleans, thereby to intrappe the Lord d'Andelot, whom they
did both doubt and hate, also to recover the Constable, whereby he might be
wholly at their mercy, if peradventure they had not caused him to be made away
in the heat of his taking. They were in possession of the Prince of Conde, who
should not very cheap depart out of their hands: and although they saw the
Admiral on foot, yet hoped they in time to mate him. They made therefore at
one flight forty Knights of the order, and divided the companies of men of
arms unto men of their own retinue. And the Duke of Guise not long before his
hurt, sufficiently discovered him self: for when one of his familiars moved
him to follow the Admiral, he answered, That perchance will not be the most
commodity to many, in case they should so soon be overcome: the cards are
not thoroughly shuflled, I have a worse beast to overcome then all the Huguenots
together, speaking of the Queen, of whom many times privately he complained,
saying, that she was very unthankful to him ward, also that closely she woue
some web with the Prince of Conde: But, said he, if God will, who knows the
wrong done to our house, (speaking of the Counties of Prouence and Anjou, and
of the crown also) I will come to an end with them al, and whatsoever it cost,
seeing my share is therein, I will have justice before the game be at an end.
The wickedness of his desire was yet more plainly perceived by an other word
which he spoke, at his making of ye last Knights of the order (among whom his
son Henry yet more meet to play with nutshales, then to handle a sword, was
one of the first) when it was objected what a reproach it would be to so many
worthy men and noble Lords as were already of the same, in case he should
put in some of those whom he had named: you, said he, do not know my meaning.
There be some said he (speaking of the Queen) who seek to live in confusion,
and therefore we must put in so many, that the disorder may bring good order.
This may you see was his care over the estate of the realm: but we may herein
perceive how he defaced himself. In the battle of Dreux the Constable was taken
fighting valiantly: the Marshal of S. Andrews was slain in the same place:
The Duke of Guise could not avoid without shame and dishonor, after he had
refused to set upon the Huguenots when his captain commanded him, and had
abandoned his general in the midst of the field. In this battle did he no
honorable deed, but lost the honor of the Prince of Condies taking, who
lighted in the Lord of Danuils hands: But to his great confusion, he had before
him the Admiral only, of whom he had spoken so much shame, and therefore
before al men sustained this reproach, that with all his power he durst not
assail him whom before he had so much despised, and who by his saying was
destitute of all virtue, valiantness and grace in commanding. The thing which
most spited the Duke of Guise, was in that he perceived himself bridled by the
yelding of New haven to the Englishmen, which unto them was granted upon
sundry not very unequal conditions, considering the time: and this caused the
Cardinal and the rest of his brethren to bite their nails, seeing new work
now cut out for them in an other place. Now they did in manner account
assuredly, that this matter was never done without some practice of the Queen
mother, with the Prince of Condie and the Admiral, and therefore did through the
means of certain their secret servants, counsel the King of Spain to ask the
custody of some towns to the King of Frances behoof, putting the Spaniard in
hope that they would procure his request to be granted, if he had been as
unjust and foolish as to have demanded the same. The Duke of Guises fretting
also a little before his wounding at Orleans, which himself disclosed to a
certain familiar friend is not altogether unknown: for he said that he
repented himself, in that he delivered not two towns to the Spanierdes in
stead of one which the Englishmen possessed: for that, said he, had been the
way to bridle the inconstancy wherewith he charge the Queen, and the envy and
ielouzy, which, said he, she bare to his greatness, besides the means yt this
might have been to do some thing for his own family, which openly he would not
discover: and yet could he not so closely keep his game, but that in saying
that he had by this means a share in the lump as the rest, a man might
discern (together with other words which he spoke) whether he were minded to
give the realm in pray, and so have a portion therein.

These discontentations did partly procure the Admiral to pass safe into
Normandy, The Du^ of Guise death.
and there anew to fortify himself, whiles the Duke of Guise laid siege to
Orleans, minding after the execution of that matter, to prepare himself unto
more haughtye enterprises: and using no talk, but such as tended to threats
against the estate and quiet of the Realm. But in the midst of al his
devises, Poltrot shot a dagge at him, whereby he lanquished certain days in
terrible torments, not without wonderful grief, for that he perceived him
self cut of in the midst of his course. Sometimes he would thrust his
finger into the wound, as if he were extremely chafed against the surgeons and
Physicians, who could not prolonge Francis the second his life, also as if he
could not give them one good look, because he saw himself ensnared. Finally
after he had forgiven his wife, and left his children to the Cardinals
tuition, not without straight charge to reuendge his death, and bring his
driftes to their perfection which so often had been frustrated, he was (as ye
would say) by death tied to the suburbs and gate of Orleans. This was the end
of the fiercest of all the Guisians, who fretted (said many) in that he
should die in the town where a King had dyed, either that now alive he
should come into the City which he and his partakers had destined for the
death of a Prince of the blood, and many good officers of the crown. The
Catholics especially of Paris (who nevertheless had small cause as afterward
appeared) did greatly bewayl his death. When the King of Navarre was slain at
Rouen, the Duke of Neuers, and the Marshal of S. Andrews at Dreux, and diverse
others in other places, there was no token of sorrow. But for the Duke of Guise,
who had abandoned his captain, who fought because he would not be accomptable
to the estates of France, who had violated the Kings edictes, and sought to
suppress the house of Valois, did they make hearses, and used al other funeral
solemnities as if he had been a King. Now therefore like as after the decease
of Francis the second, all the whole court which environed the Guisians
vanished away, and al their multitudes at the same instant converted into
solitariness, yea that many who before had followed them, were now ready not
only to hold ye basen to who^soeuer would cut their throats, but eue^
themselves to paunch the^: so after ye death of their eldest brother, they
remained as a body without members, being forsaken of most men, and through the
unreasonable authority which they had usurped, become odious unto such as to
them were most vprignt. The Cardinal now being at Trente, sought new means how
to begin at an other end: and first dealt with the Spaniard, as himself did
since disclose to one of the chief counselers of a certain noble french
Lord: for having declaimed against, and reproved the estate of matters of
France, he toulde him that the Spaynishe government was excellent and good,
where the Great Lords of the country do so bridle their King, that they permit
him scarsely to sport him self: handling him after the manner of counters, of
which a man makes that which sometime is worth but one, sometime worth ten,
sometimes worth a hundred, sometimes worth ten thousand, and immediately
reducing it again to nothing at his pleasure: neither were it (said he) a very
hard matter to reduce France to the same poincte. In the mean time he
counterfaited the mourner, writing such consolatory letters unto his mother, as
a man would hardly read without laughi^g, especially where he writes these
words, Madame, I say unto you, that God never so greatly honored any mother,
neither at any time did so much for any his creature, (excepting always his
own glorious mother) then he has done for you. But this good child of the
most blessed mother in the world, next to the virgin Marie, invented other new
practices against the estate of his King and country, as we now shall perceive.

The Duke of Guise his mouth being stopped, The first pacificat^
peace presently ensued, but in such manner as did easelie show that such
remembraunces, as the Cardinal left at his going to the Councille, were of
great force. For the edicte made in the month of Ianuarye was in manner
extinguished, the Prince of Condye displaced from the rowme which to him
apperteined, as to the first Prince of the blood, the Admiral and other great
Lords expulsed the Court, but principally the said Admiral, who was charged
with procuring the shot at the Duke of Guise, which nevertheless was but a
policy which the Cardinal and his fautours practiced, to the end still to
keep the water troubled, and them selves out of accomptes: in which poincte,
the Queen mother somewhat favored the Guisians, in that she was glad to put
from her son al honorable persons, to the end to bring him up and frame him
according to her own humors, the effects whereof have since manifestly appeared.

Many things chanced in France between the first and second troubles, The
Gu^^^ans beha^ours bet^ the first (...) second t^bles.
wherein the Guisians sleightes diversely appeared, to the destruction of the
realm; whereof we will touch some the most notable particularities, not staying
overmuch upon the circumstance of Days: in that that entreating of their
injuries offered to the Princes of the blood, to the nobility, to the estates
and to other private parties in the Realm, we may behold such matters as now
we will pass over.

First, the Cardinal labored the Queen mother to grant the estate of great
master, unto his nephue Henry son to the late Duke of Guise. So that
notwithstanding this child was not capable thereof, yet to the great dishonor
of the King and the Realm, and in despite of the Constable and the
Protestants, whom the Queen began to hate, he was chosen great Master,
standing in deed in greater need of a Scholemaster and rods.

After the King of Navarre was dead, the Queen mother became a Catholic, for
she douted lest the Prince of Conde, then first Prince of the blood would hold
his estate, and (knowing her humors, through the assistance of the
Chastillo^s, and the Constable himself, whose heat began now to cool) reduce
her to order, and take the government from her. The Cardinal foreseing also,
that if this were brought to pass, both he and al his should be plucked away,
determined to take some order. At the assembly at Orleans, the estates with
one common consent had made great complaints of the unreasonable gifts, which
both King Henry and King Francis the second had given to sundry persons, of
whom some were unworthy, others had had too much, seeking to call to accounts
those who had the charge and government of the treasure. The first part of
these complaints, touching the unworthiness of persons, concerned especially
and from the bottom of their hearts, the Duchess of Valentinois, and al her
abomination. The second of excess did pinche to the quick the Guisians, the
Marshal of S. Andrews, and some others. An other point of this complaint
tended wholly against the Guisians, as having relation only to the time of
Francis the second, whom they had ordered at their pleasures, in whose time
much money was spent and consumed. On the other side, the reformation of the
ecclesiastical estate, whereupon the nobility and third estate did earnestly
call, killed the Cardinals heart outright. Wherefore to the end to procure this
pursuit to vanish away, he and his brethren could invent no better shift, then
by kindeling the civil war aforesaid. The same now being pacified, he
propounds unto the Queen mother, that to keep the Prince of Conde from
chalenging his degree, and abolishing her government, it were most expedient
to proclaim the Kings Maioritie, as also she was minded to have done before
the King of Nauarres deceasse. For the Cardinal knew that so long as the Queen
mother was Mistress, the accomptes should never be taken, because that in
permitting the estates to search so narrowly the behauiours of governors, it
was to be feared least in time they would examine her self. As for the
reformation of the Clergy, he propounds to her how profitable that would be
for the advancement of the Protestants, which necessarily must ensue, for she
should raise against her the Spanierd, the Pope and the Catholics, and so
should lose her credit, and peradventure her authority also. According
therefore to this counsel, shortly after the peace the Kings Maioritie was
proclaimed, wherein the Queen mother and the Cardinal made him play a terrible
part, in procuring him to speak as big as if he were forty years old,
when in deed it was they that spoke with his lips.

To this counsel the Cardinal yet added an other, touching the instruction of
the King and of his brethren. For he showed the Queen, that if she suffered the
Princes and Lords of the Religion to come near her children, either else so
timely trained them up in the affairs, they might be won, and in time do her
self some displeasure, or at the least wise, put her from the government, and
then choose other counsaylers, as the Bourbons, Montmorencies and Chastillons.
For remedy whereof, he causes the King to wast his time with a top and
scourge stick, at cockefights, at putting dogs together by the ears, or
setting them upon this body or that body, in hearing of plays, seeing of
daunces, talking with harlots: finally in swearing and whorehunting, and al in
the Queens presence and knowledge, through the dealings of diverse of the
Guisians servants. Also because the King of him self was wild enough,
somewhat to cool these heates, he was sent on hunting whiles a priest and a
woman governed the Realm.

To keep the Protestants also still in breath, and so to stop the King, that
with the time he might not so favor both the parties at once, that finally the
Guisians policies should be detected, the Cardinal caught hold of an occasion
which the Queen mother had practiced a little before the Edict of pacification.
There was a certain, I wot not what, deposition attributed to Poltrot, wherein
he confessed that the Admiral had procured him to slaye the Duke of Guise: and
although the Admiral hearing the brute hereof, which la Pallet servant to the
Guisians had caused to be noysed among the Protestant Reistres, who were come
to the Protestants aid, and therewithal considering the consequence thereof,
had by express letters entreated the Queen mother to cause the said Poltrot
to be repriued, to the end to be brought face to face, yet had she by
sentence of the Parliament of Paris caused him to be drawn asunder with four
horses. Wherein was to be seen the cloking and wonderful policies of the
Queen mother and the Cardinal. But as touching the Queens practices, they
require an other Legende. And in respect of the Cardinal, he was the gladdest
man alive of this advantage, whereby at his pleasure to bring the Realm again
into troubles, to rid his hands of his enemies, of Bourbon, of Montmorencie,
and of Chastillon: and indeed this justice which he procured the Duke of
Guises widow and children to prosecute, was a very proper means to help him
self with all: For soon after, he yet proceeded giving the Queen to
understand, that neither her regiment, neither the Kings estate would ever be
assured so long as the Bourbons, Montmorencies and Chastillons were on
horseback: that it was meet to humble them, and to set so many men against
them, that the King and his assistantes might continue masters. Also that in
case she would accept of his brethren and nephues, also of such as were
affectionate to that race, she should find them pressed with all means
possible: Again, that so long as she would mislike of the Protestants, most
towns in the Realm would bestow their whole power to the maintenance of her
and her authority.

Moreover, because it had been too much so to disquiet all things at once, and
a little to hazard them selves, rather then to deal with the three houses
aforesaid together, having consulted with his brethren, the said Cardinal
propounded to the Queen mother, that it were best first to dispatch the
Chastillons, whereunto the justice which the Guisians demanded might serve for
a color, also for that it would be hard coming by them by force, it were
best in showing them a good countenance to intrappe them at once. Now
notwithstanding the Queen were not ignorant of the unrighteousness of this
counsel, also of such confusions as might ensue: yet preferring her own
ambition before the quietness of her children and Realm, she took that way.
For, although she did not greatly love the Guisians, yet being assured that
she should the better compass her matters, also that they were already so
deep in these affairs, that they would with her hazard all means for their
preservation, and therefore now there was no more to do but to find
opportunity to be rid of the Chastillons. But when they were at the point
to practice their matters, the Prince of Conde in the Kings open counsel
took the Admirals matter in hand, and plainelye declared that who so ever
dealt with the Admiral otherwise then by Law and equity, he the said Prince
would not suffer it. This therefore together with other considerations,
procured the counterfayt atonement between the Admiral and the Guisians, which
was made at Moulins as the King was in his journey to Bayonne.

This journey was undertaken through the advice of the Queen and the Cardinal,
under pretense of visiting the realm: but in effect to confer with the
Spaniard, to renew a league which might reduce the realm into new troubles,
as indede it came to pass after this race was run. And the whiles the
Cardinal and his brethren framed other practices as follows.

The Cardinal at his being at Trent had procured an after session, thereby to
publish the King of France to be an heretic, a schismatike, and an
excommunicate person, in case he persisted in selling the demaines of the
Church, although the same sale was of his own inventions, and that he together
with his brother had granted thereto before his departure: for to the
obteining of their greatness and accomplishing of their purposes, nothing was so
holy, but it might be alienated. In the same practice he determined to open and
give in spoil to the first conqueror, the realm of Navarre, because of the
religion which the Queen and her son the Prince did profess. Whereof the King
being advertised, he sent word to the Ambassadors and Bishops of his realm
spedily to come their ways from the Council, publishing moreover vehement
protestations against the auctours of the said counsel. But herein consisted an
other of the Cardinals policies, who secretly alleged that he had invented
these means somewhat to gratify the Pope and the Spaniard, to whom he
presented a new pray, and on the other side he writ to the Queen mother,
that the King must needs counterfeit a discontentation hereat, whereby to
allure the Queen of Navarre, and so to separate her from the Prince and the
Chastillons, the readilier to dispatch each after other. Here upon he returned
into France, and there set his matters in such order as shortly you shall
perceive, and then made a new voyage unto Rome, there personally to solicit
this curse against the Queen of Navarre. And then to the end to clear him
self of such mischief, he departed two days before judgment should be given:
from whence being arrived at Venice, he there sharply accused the Pope and
consistory of Rome for transgressing the Kings pleasure, whereby to persuade
men that he was not of that conspiracy or faction.

At his return, for the accomplishment of his promise, The Art^cles of the
Council which the Cardinal^ propou^de^ thereby again to trouble t^ Realm.
he was so impudent as to present the Councilles articles unto the King, not so
much for the establishing of the same at the first dashe, as to the end by
little and little to adnichilate the Edict of pacification. And to the end it
might have the fayrer show, at his soliciting the Embassadoures of Spain,
Sauoy and the Pope, came to the Court, and presented certain Articles devised
at the instance of the Cardinal and his adherentes, which here we have set
down, because they do reveal the foundation of the rest of the troubles
which since have ensued in France.

In the first point, they called upon the King to keep and cause to be kept
within his own Realm, the Countries, Territories and Lordshippes in his
obedience, the articles of the holy council lately holden at Trente, which now
they had brought with them to the same end. And for the reading of the same,
and to swear thereunto before the Delegates of the said council, they
assigned the said King to be at Nancy in Lorrayne upon our Lady day in March,
there to meet with their said Lords, who together with all other Christian
Kings and Princes were determined, to make a general constitution
correspondent to the same which was made at Trente, for the rooting out of all
heresies and new doctrines repugnant to the said holy council.

In the second point they requested the said Lord to cease alienating the
temporalities of the Church, certifying him on the behalf of the King of
Spain, and of the Duke of Sauoy, that they neither do nor ever did mean to
be paid their marriage money, which the late King Henry had promised them out
of the church goods: and therefore that he ought to be content with some
voluntary gift, which the Ecclesiastical persons should give him, having
regard unto such sackes and spoils, as lately have been committed in his
Realm, under his name and by his Edict: whereof they do nevertheless
(according as they have been desired) hold him excused through his youth.

In the third point, that at the least wise he should bannishe (unless he had
rather otherwise punish them) the chief seditious persons and schismatikes
of his Realm, by whose means the aforesaid spoils of Churches have been
committed, and who have brought the enemies of his Crown into the Realm, and
given strangers free entry thereinto.

In the fourth, that he should revoke the remission and absolution, which in
his Edict of pacification he had granted, especially against such persons as
had committed treason against GOD: showing him that it was neither in him nor
in any other Christian King or Prince, to remitte or forgive the offense
committed against the Divine Majesty, for that all such remission appertains
unto God only.

In the fifth, that he as King for his part would assiste Justice, and the
same authorize, as his predecessors have done, because that thereof depends
the authority of all Christian Kings and Princes: also that in so doing, he
should punish the traiterous murder committed in the person of the late Duke
of Guise, by such as manifestly are known: and that in such cases he ought
not to use any dissimulation, considering what person he was, who so accursedly
was murdered. Also that he should procure him self to be obeyed as a King, so
that Justice might florishe in his Realm: And that the Lords whose
Ambassadors they are, do offer unto him all aid and help, so soon as he
the said King shall demand the same.

Ever since that the Guisians usurped this authority over the Crown, by
making our Kings their slaves, we have always had two kind of Councilles, of
the Kings Letters, and of his words, the one open, the other secret. The
privy Council do entreat of such matters as they would that all the world
should know. The letters patentes and open speeches do serve for confirmations
of the same.

But now the Guisians have induced a secret Council, which also sometimes is
divided into three parts. For the Queen mother has one, the Guisians an
other, and sometime the King has the third, which do consiste of certain
who do govern him. In these Councils have all the matters of our time been
determined of: from whence these bloody executions have ensued. The letters of
the Seal are ordinarily contrary to the letters patentes, and open speeches
unto those which are whispered in the ear: as it came to pass at the coming
of these Embassadoures, for publicly in the view of all the world, the King
answered them, that the Edicte of pacification was made for the expelling of
the enemies out of his Realm, and for other matters generally: but
particularly their demaundes were handled in the secret Council, in such wise
as the effects have since declared. The six and twentieth day of February in
the year 1563. the King opened one part of this declaration unto the aforesaid
Embassadoures: and to the end the better to color all matters, the Cardinal
and the Queen mother had taught it him by heart, together with the manner how
to pronounce it with his mouth, for at that time he was as well seen in that
he spoke, as in that that he spoke not, for he was yet but a child, especially
in such matters.

Now must we note that one day before, the Cardinal had obtained of the
Queen a license in the manner of a brief, signed by Secretary Bourdin, wherein
he was permitted to bear weapons both by Edictes and letters patentes
forbidden. But if any man ask why he got this brief, rather of the Queen then
of the King, seeing that the only Lawmaker my dispense with the law which him
self has made: either wherefore he demanded not letters patentes rather then
a simple brief: I will leave the judgment thereof to such as be free from all
affection. For that which immediately ensued, does sufficiently detect the
purposes both of the Cardinal and his adherents.

But to be able here to specify those purposes, as well in the outridings which
they procured the King to make, under pretense of the journey to Bayonne, where
their holy league was confirmed, and order taken with the Duke of Alba for the
ouerrunning of the Protestants: either of certain other leagues made in
sundry parts of the realm through the driftes of the Guisians, from the
which proceeded the horrible murders, especially in the Counties of Maine,
Tourayne and Vandosme. Also in Guyen where the Marshal of Bourdillo^, and in
other places other officers were to much at the beck of the Queen and the
Guisians. Neither will I here particularly rehearse these murders, whereafter
followed extorsions, and wonderful iniustices in sundry cities of the realm:
neither the sleights which the Cardinal used to win the Prince of Conde,
under pretense of an imaginatiue kingdom and marriage, whereby to weaken the
Admiral: Neither will I speak of the Citadels erected in sundry places in
the Realm, of the razing of towns which the Protestants held in the first
troubles, of the false accusations laid to their charges, of the declaration
or Edict of Roussillon, which manifestly abolished the Edict of pacification,
of the scorning of the declarations which the Prince of Conde made against the
same edict, together with the flouting of those who sought for quietness and
justice. Of the murders at Tours and at the castle of Loyre, of the presumption
of Chauigny, who was slave to the Queen and the Guisians, of the banishment of
certain Protestants in the town of Rochelle. I will not here make any larger
mention of the forbidding of the Protestants to keep any schools, which was
done at the Cardinals pursuit, who therein did imitate the Edict of Julian the
Apostate against the Christians: either of the said Cardinals endeavor to
destroy the souls together with the bodies, in that he procured that the
ministers should not visit the sick, or abide in any other place then where
the exercises of the Religion should for the Bailiwickes be houlden.

On the one side the Cardinal of Guise practiced with the bishop of Man's,
whereof ensued infinite mischiefs. On an other side the Duke of Aumale was in
Champagne, where he did little better. He took from them of Troy the exercise
of their Religion, which by the Kings declaration was permitted in their
suburbs, and assigned them an other very discommodious village. He by his own
auctority changed the place of the Bailiwick of Chaumont unto Bassigny, against
the Kings express decree. And to the declaration which the Lieutenant of the
Bailiwick (a manifest enemy to the Gospel) concerning the commandment which he
had to accommodate the Protestants in case the governor should refuse: he
answered that he had contrary Edicts from the King in his sleeue, and therefore
forbad the said lieutenant from proceeding any further. He imprisoned an
Advocate at Troy, because he had presented to the King a poor widows
supplication, whose arms and legs they had after the peace cut of. He caused
to pill and sack the receauer of Mascons house. He in all manner of wise
favored the seditious and open murderers of Creuant. On an other side the
Cardinal of Lorraine was in arms, accompanied with certain knights of the
Order, and the rebels of Paris and other places, who seeing the Protestants on
all sides ouerrunne, sought nothing but some mighty man to set them to the like
work, considering also that the King was far of, in whose absence they were
very desirous to be doing, and to make a terrible broyle. But the Marshal of
Montmorency foreseing the same, and understanding that not only at Paris, but
also in most towns of the Realm; the seditious persons lay in wait and
watched for the Cardinals coming, certified the King of whatsoever he
understood, whereupon he received a precept, that he should not permit the
Cardinal or any of the Guisians to enter in warlike array into Paris. Again
after that the Marshall was advertised of the brief, which the Cardinal had
obtained of the Queen mother, he diverse times advertised the King, especially
at Chaalons, Bar, Mascon and Lions, that if the Cardinal and his guard came
armed to Paris, he would endeavor to unarm him. Also five or six months
before the rumor was spread in Paris of the Cardinals coming guarded with
harquebuziers, the said Marshal made the like declaration both openly and
particularly unto the Cardinals especial servants. And to the end no man
might pretend any cause of ignorance, the thirtenth of December 1564, he made
proclamation with sound of trumpet, and then printed, that upon pain of death
no soldiers ordained for the guard of any governors or government, should
enter within his precinct: declaring in express words to the end the
Cardinal might understand that this defense touched himself, that it was not
lawful for any lord whatsoever, unless he were a Prince of the house of
France to enter into the government of the isle of France with any guard. All
this notwitstanding, the Cardinal took his way to Paris: and departing from
Reims, noysed that he went unto Ginuille. And although he were tender, yet did
he in the sharpest of winter take the fields, making exceeding iourneys, and
such as him self was never wont to do in any time whatsoever, or upon any
kind of occasion. After his coming to S. Dionice, there were many goings to
and fro. In the mean time the Marshal went to the Parliament house, where he
knew the Cardinal had always endeavored to procure most benefactours and
friends, there to complain of the said Cardinal, in that he came to throw
himself headlong, and as the proverb is, to burn in the flame. Moreover he
sent a Provost to keep the way, who endeavored to apprehende the foremost of the
Cardinals guard and harquebuziers that he met, who notwithstanding all these
warninges, understanding that his brother d'Aumale, who before with his troops
had kept the fields, should now enter into Paris at one gate, came thither
also with his men toward evening, the streets being replenished with people
attending his coming. But the Marshall of Montmorency accompanied with
certain lords and gentlemen of name, came in his way, The Card^nalles entr^
into Pari^
and so sone as he perceived the weapons of those who accompanied the said
Cardinal, called alowde to them to lay the same away: whereupon some fled,
and a few strokes were given, wherewith one of the said Marshal of
Montmorencyes gentlemen was slain: And the Cardinal and his nephue the Duke of
Guise were worse afeard then hurt, so that sodeinly alighting they saved them
selves in a house at hand, where it was said that the Cardinal was in such
plight, that his hosen served him in stead of a basen, and his doublet for a
close stool: hereupon the said Cardinal more coward then a hare, seeing
himself thus disapointed, together with his company departed without any
sound of trumpet.

The voice went the same time, (and the Admiral whom the Marshal of
Montmorency had sent for, to the end to assiste him both with counsel and
help, affirmed the same to the chief of Paris) that there was a letter which
came from the Guisians, sent into Normandy, containing these words. The
readiest way to restore in France those to whom the Crown does appertain by
right, and to expulse the house of Valois, is to sack the Huguenots who do
support the same, and therefore we must sell their woods to gather therewith
money and weapons: and in the end was added, that the said Huguenots that
would go to law, need not care for taxing their charges. It was not unknown
also that in sundry places the Catholics made collections of money, to what
end let all men judge. While the Admiral was at Paris, the Duke d'Aumale being
hu^grye, and seking to catch some odd Crown, withdrew him self to Annet with
his mother in law, whither he brought the guard which was allowed him for the
government of Bourgundie, and there quaked for fear lest the Marshall of
Montmorency, because it was in his government, and besides for that his said
guard did many extorsions unto their neighbors, would send to apprehende him.
Wherefore he writ every way to his friends, desiring them to come and succor
him, and to help him to get away, so that he might go to his charge. At this
summons some came, others made no great account: and of those that came, there
tarried not twenty, by reason of a certain declaration, wherewith a gentleman
of Normandy reduced them all to their right wits. For how would you (said he to
the Duke of Aumale) that we should take weapon against a Marshall of France,
who with his only word, is able to take the same from us, and catch us in his
danger? Yea if he should command us to turn against you, what should we do,
unless we would be rebels and disobedient to our King? Again, the answer of
a gentleman of Maine who could not come at his summons, which was intercepted,
is worthy the noting, in respect of the French freedom of speech unto such as
know not them selves, wherein is to be seen what judgment we are to give of
true Princes.

(...) letter to (...) Duke Aumale.
The words of this letter in this poinct were these. I said not, my lord, that
you were no Prince, either that I am not your servant: But peradventure I
affirmed that I knew no french man that did acknowledge you for a Prince of the
blood, or of the crown, wherein I do not think that I did amiss, but rather
should have offended in aduowing the same: yea I never heard or knew that
either you or any of yours did pretend thereunto. As for service, in as much as
your messenger said that you accounted me unthankful, I told him in deed,
that I was subject to none but to the King, neither ought any obedience but to
him and his officers, every man in his vocation. Thus much will I now add, that
I never was servant to other then the Princes of the blood, neither did owe any
duty to other man living, except of free heart, and that so long as I listed,
neither do I believe (my lord) that you do otherwise think of me. For you
know that I have spent twelve thousand franckes of my own goods, in following
the late Lord your father, my lord your brother and your selves, and yet
never took wages of any of you all, or received benefit or advantage at any
of your hands. I am, I thank God, a gentleman, and yet never did deed
strayng therefro, and bouldly I may say without wrong to any, that I am to none
but to the King, his Princes, my friends and my self: for at this day I have
no other master that nourishes me, or pays my wages then my self: Not that
I mean utterly to renounce doing you service, or that of courtisie I be not
your servant, so long as you take it of a free heart, without any kind of
bond that I owe unto you. For it is not unknown unto you, that there be many
who (under the like auctority as yourselfe) would pretend as much interest in
me, which to dye for it, no man shall forcibly compel me to aduowe: for so
should I do injury unto those to whom all service is dew, and unto all french
Nobility, who justly might reproach it unto me. This was the speech of a true
French gentleman, which all such as do bear this title have not marcked
according as they ought.

The Duke d'Aumale being escaped thence as well as he might, went into
Champagne, The Du^ d'Aumal^ letter of ^spiracie.
where he devised new practices wherewith to keep the water thick, and the
five and twentieth of February 1565, which was six weeks after the Cardinals
entry into Paris, he writ a letter to his brother the Marquise d'Ellebeufe,
therein detecting the Guisians affections, and their desire never to suffer
France to be in quiet. In this letter having touched all that had passed at
Paris, and scorned the King and Queen, saying that it was their custom to give
out the fairest speeches and promises in the world, he adds this: In the
mean time, brother, whiles you continue there, namely in Touraine, I think you
were best to visit the lord of Montpensier, to whom I will write a letter
bearing credit, according to your request. And it were your wisest; with him
and other Lords our friends thereabout to practice some good associatio^,
which should have been long ago compassed, if every man had done his endeavor.
I know some who were the motioners, and yet when it came to effect, they bledde
at the nose, as also in many other things: for if every man would for his own
part take pains, we should soon come to some good end, considering what
good occasions are now offered us. But they whom it touches as near as me,
do not accoumpt of it as I could wish they did. I would be very loath the
fault should be in me: at the least, if God lend me life, I will let them
understand the contrary: and sorye would I be, to lose that reputation
whereunto I have so long aspired, as I hope I shall not. I have already often
written to the lords of Montpensier, Estampes, Martigues and Chauigny, so that
they might plainly perceive how feign I would be revenged, and how desirous I
am of the association that you speak of: and sufficiently do foresee how
necessary it were not for us only, but for all honest men, whom now they are
more bent against then ever: and therefore, brother, I would think it
excellent well, if the said Lords would hearken thereunto, and leave the
walled towns, because there is no certaintye in the people (This he speake^^
by the people of Paris, who when they saw how the Marshal of Montmorency had
assailed, and in manner unarmed the Cardinal, did seem to mislike of his
enterprise) as lately I did perceive. But with the Nobility I am fully
resolved and ready priest to deal, and for my part will spare no cost,
thinking that the sooner would be the better, which makes me desire you well to
see unto it, and diligently thereof to consider, together with the said Lord
of Montpensier, and to send me word of your determinations, to the end that
according to the same I may take order with such of the Lords and noble men as
remain hereabout, and dwell within my government, who will do whatsoever I
shall request.

Now must I not forget to certify you, that writing this letter, I had the
sight of the copye of another letter, which the lord of Montpensier wrote to
the Marshal of Montmorency, as an answer to that which the said Marshal had
written to him concerning his goodly deed. I pray you thank him in our
behalfes, but chiefly in mine, notwithstanding I do it in the letter which I
do write unto him: we all are greatly behoulding to him. Moreover if you see
the Bishop of Man's, it were not amiss to move him also in the same
association, for both he and his friends would be glad to hearken thereunto,
and we have already conferred thereof. You might do well also to write unto
the Lord of Martigues, or if you can see him, it were better to commune
thereof together. I know his good will toward us is nothing diminished, and
likewise he may be sure of ours, as you may better give him to understand, and
I will seal unto whatsoever you and the said lords shall agree upon. I send
this messenger, purposedly to the end that by him I may the better be
certified of your news. He may tarry with you so long as you think good, and
then come to me into Champagne. Written the four and twentieth of February
1565.

Seven months before, the said Guisians had practiced an other league in
Guye^ne, through the means of the lord of Candales, the Marquise of Trans and
others, whereof the Queen mother being advertised, she sent them word to pass
on no further therein: which, notwithstanding afterward when they perceived
them selves strengthened through the aduow of the principal in the Realm, they
sought to bring to effect.

On the other side the Marquise d'Ellebeufe, through the soliciting of the
Duke of Aumale, did practice his league in his government of Touraine,
gathering together from all parts all the thieues and common murderers of the
country, who under his protection daily committed infinite robberies and
slaughters, so that neither any honest man might escape without travail, nor
quietness rest without troubles.

^e Cardi^^lles pra^ses.
The Cardinal of Lorraine also for his part practiced sundry matters about the
same time, and endeavored to bring the Baronages of the Bishopric of Metz
under the Emperors protection, if the lord of Salcede the Kings lieutenant at
Marsault, had not through force stopped the publication of the said protection.
Upon which occasion the Cardinal skirmished with him, and arreared the war
called the Cardinals war, wherein he had as good success, as in his entry
into Paris. But albeit herein he became a laughing stock and execrable
altogether, yet did he still bear a grudge unto the said Salcede, and razed
him out at saint Bartlemewes murder, procuring him to be slain at Paris, and
his house utterly to be sacked.

But the chief occasion of suspicion ministered touching this matter, was that
this drifte was not executed without the counsayl of the Baron of Poluiller,
the governor of Haguenau, who for that cause came to the Cardinal to
Rembeuiller in Lorraine: who has also been a solliciter of the most part of
such enterprises, as have been practiced against the estate of France, both
during the wars of Picardie, and after that they were ended. This was he also
who endeavored to surprise the town of Lions, and to procure the countries of
Bresse and Sauoy to reuolte, through the counsel of the Cardinal of Arras
about the end of the said wars. This was the same Poluiller, who practiced
the King of Navarre to revolt, promising him in recompense the realm of
Navarre. This is that Poluiller, who being the Cardinal of Lorrains broker,
durst practice the Prince of Conde, under pretense and vain hope of helping
him to the lands of the Bishopric of Metz, in case he would have professed
the Romish religion: wherefore the readers may well consider what cou^sail is
to be hoped for at such a counsaylours hands, being also co^ioyned unto the
Cardinal of Lorraine, who during his aboade at Rembeuiller and in Lorraine,
did many goodly deeds: for he pilled his subjects of the Bishopric of Metz
under pretense of withdrawing the lands engaged unto the County John of
Nassaw: He persuaded the Duke of Lorraine to murder all his subjects that were
of the Religion, which he had done in case the Lords of Castelet and
Bassompierre had not with their counsel restrained him. He procured him also
to bannishe a great number of the inhabitauntes of Pont-amosson, for hatred to
the Gospel. Moreover he suborned (some say he defiled and forcibly took) the
daughter of the Baylie of Rembeuillers wives chamber maid.

The original of the Duke d'Aumales letters to his brother the Marquise, new
sleig^ for proc^ring of t^bles.
whereof we have seen part of an abstract was presented unto the King, who
thereupon having heard the depositio^ of one of his Knights of the order, who
confessed that he had subscribed to the association aforementioned in the said
letters, caused in his privy council this act following to be made, which
here we have set down, to the end thereby hereafter to consider certain
notable crafts of Italian Cardinallike policies.

This day being the 18. day of May 1565, the King being at Mont de Marsan
assisted by the Queen his mother and his brother my lord the Duke of Orleans,
has called and assembled the Princes of his blood, his privy council, and
other his Lords and Knights of the order, who were about his person: to whom
he has given to understand how he has been advertised, that in diverse places
of his Realm, there be made associations, collections of coin, enroulings of
men, gatherings of armor and horses: that some have so far strayed from
their duties, as to send men out of his Realm, to have intelligence and
communication with foreign Princes without his knowledge, contrary to his
Edictes of Pacification, of maioritie, and other ordinances, declarations and
prohibitions against such like matters, which he neither can, ne yet will
believe, by reason of such account as he makes of the affection and sincere
good will of al his subjects, to the obeying of his commandments, ye commodity
of his service and the quiet of his realm. Nevertheless to the end better to
be instructed in the truth, he admonished and charged them to tell him the
truth of all that they have heard. Which they have done, and moreover do most
humbly beseech his majesty to believe, that they are so far wide of these so
pernicious practices, that rather they be ready and pressed to spend their lives
and goods, as always they have done, in procuring him to be obeyed, and his
edictes and ordinances to be observed for the rest and tranquillity of his
said realm. And we declare upon their lives and honors, that they be in no
wise participa^t in any such intelligences, or have any co^munications with
such as are desirous to make any such enterprises. Also as for them selves,
they know not the meanings of any associations, leagues, oaths, promises, or
seals given to any such intent, and the same do utterly renounce, not minding
in any wise to participate in them, as in things contrary to the obedience due
unto his majesty, and to the quiet of the realm, which to their powers they
will defend and mainteyne, and therein follow or know no other meaning then his
Majesty's, not intending for any private quarrel or occasion whatsoever, to take
or cause to take weapons in the behalf of any man living without his express
commandment. Also although his Majesty do sufficiently know their loyalty
and fidelity, and be of the same so well assured, that in their opinions he
can desire no other more assured proof the^ the effects, yet were they content
for the satisfying of his Majesty's request, to sign this act with their
seals. Also to the end that under a false pretense no man may cloak his
wicked intent under their names, and because the Princes of the blood, and
other Princes, Governors, Knights of the order and captains being absent
might know and understand ye co^tents aforesaid, his Majesty wills that this
present act be sent unto the^, that by their seals, they may yield a like
testimony of their intents and good meanings in the same respect, no less (as
he assures him self) faithful, the^ those who be about his person, and
therefore will not believe that they will stick any thing at al thereat. For he
can not account such as by their seals do refuse to make declaration, other
then guilty of such enterprises, factions, and intelligences, and so
consequently worthy his evil will, as conte^ners of the authority of him and
his edictes, perturbers of the common peace, and therein guilty of treason. And
in that case for such does he account them and from henceforth declare the^.
And so likewise of all other who know any thing of the said associations,
factions and co^spiracies, unless they presently come and reveal what they
are assured of unto his Majesty, as is the duty of good and lawful
subjects, whom also he intends and will preserve and defend to the uttermost
of his power, taking them into his protection against al such as shall endeavor
to offend them. In witness whereof, he has the day and year aforesaid signed
with his own hand to this present act. This Act now served as a powder to
throw in the protestants eyes, thereby to blind the sight of such things as
were practiced against the^. Also the Queen mother according to the Cardinals
instructions and remembrances, fained her self offended with ye Guisians,
thereby to procure the chiefest Protestants by little and little to come, and of
them selves to fall into the pit prepared for the^. The Cardinal also and his
brethren made as if this act had touched the^, but secretly knowing what they
had to do, they followed their point. And the^ did letters of the signet fly
into al places, so that thereof proceeded what soever was afterward executed in
the countries of Tourayn and Maine, and other provinces, to the prejudice of
the Edicts and underhand authorized against the Protestants, notwithstanding
whatsoever the Prince of Condies and others declarations. When then the
Catholics removed both heaven and earth, and brought al things into confusion,
a paper decree, stuffed full of fair pretenses, quieted and appeased al, but if
the Protestants stirred never so little to the end under so violent a tyranny to
take breath, then was no speech but of fire and blood, as witnessed the more
then barbarouse and turkish cruelties executed upon the inhabitants of Pamiers,
who falsely were accused of sedition, for that they would not suffer their
throats to be cut, and yet at the first summons of the Lord of Ra^bouillet,
because he came in the Kings name, and promised that they should have nothing
done to them without order of law, they submitted them selves.

The King in the mean time arrived at Bayonne, where the holy league was
renewed, which contained a full determination to root out all the Protestants,
without exception of degree, kind, age or place. They should have begun in
France, but the preparatiues were somewhat long, for the Cardinal of Lorraine
had not yet accomplished his practices in diverse places with strangers:
neither were the associations within the realm very well assured. The Prince of
Conde also and the Admiral being advertised of all that had passed at Bayon, as
well through the late Prince of la Roche sur-yon as otherwise, stood upon their
guard, which caused all for a while to be deferred.

About the same time began the wars of Flanders, by means whereof they
determined, with the advice of the Cardinal who daily was su^moned to perform
his promise as well by the Cardinal Granuel as by the Pope, (for Granuel daily
advertised him of al things) that without farther delay they should use the
Duke d' Albaes passage to bring their conspiracies to effect: and diverse
messages were sent to the Duke d' Alba thereupon. About the same time also
namely in the year 1567 in the months of July, August and September, sundry
councils were holden at Marchais and Monceaux, whereby to determine according
to the Cardinals remembrances, of the most assured and final means, which
were to be observed for the execution of their enterprises: and in the last
council holden at Marchais through the Guisians advice, it was decreed that the
King should go to Bois de Vincennes, and thither under some honest pretense
should send for the Prince of Condy and the Admiral: to the which commandment
if they both, or any one of the^ did obey, he should immediately be apprehended:
but in case they refused, then the six thousand Switzers who had been levied
under pretense of defending Calais against the Queen of England, and also to
keep the borders until the Duke d' Alba were past, lest he should enterprise
any thing against the Kings dominions, should be employed. Also that they had
ready twenty two companies of men of war, already chosen and enrouled to
muster in arms, who were already charged, through whose help together with
the said Switzers, they might easily surprise and assure them selves of the
Prince and Admiral. And in the mean time that with all rigor they should
research the Protestants, touching their behauiours contrary to the edict of
Roussillon, namely the gentlemen that had received into their houses to the
sermons, any other then their own subjects. Whereupon at the instance and
soliciting of the Cardinal of Lorrayn, it was decreed not long before his
coming to the Court, that the great days should be holden at Poictiers,
especially to tend unto the process of those who should be found culpable in
the said pretended misbehauiours, and them to declare guilty of treason: and
inasmuch as those presidentes and counselours of the court of Parliament of
Paris, as were appointed to go thither, seemed insufficient, partial and
factious in the Cardinals sight, he caused to cut of seven from the list which
was first made, and in their steades did surrogate others of his own creation
and conditions. For the country of Normandy he sent the master of requests
named S. Martin, to whom he procured a commission to the same end with letters
directed to the court of Parliament of Rouen, tending that with the said de. S.
Martin, they should tend to the performance of his commission, and not break
up the court, notwithstanding it were almost vacation time.

On an other side the Cardinal endeavored through the Constables means, to
bring the Admiral and his brethren on sleep, who had already written certain
letters, which detected the trains laid for them. The six thousand Switzers
who were levied for the execution hereof, about this time came to the King to
Meaux, who was environed with the Guisians, so that the Prince and the Admiral
plainly perceiving, that it was against them and the Protestants that these
preparatiues were made, determined before things were at a worse poynct, to
come to the King, and for that he was in both his and their enemies hands, they
thought it best to take into their company certain gentlemen of name, of their
kinsfolks and friends, to the number of a hundred or six score, also to take
some weapons for their assurance: which the Cardinal and his adherents failed
not to cause the King to take in very evil part, and the more to provoke him
against the Protestants, they persuaded him that his death was at hand, unless
with all speed he got to Paris, seeing that the Prince of Condye and the Admiral
came with fifteen hundred or two thousand horses, entending to force his
majesty, the Queen his mother and my Lords his brethren, and to enterprise
somewhat against the estate: and therefore the 28 of September about four of
clock in the morning, they caused the King to depart, and put him among the
Switzers, supposing that if the Prince were so well accompanied as they reported
(which was false, for when he came to speak to the King between Meaux and
Paris, he had not at the most above three hundred horse) things might grow to
such pass, that still some of their enemies of one side or other might go to
wrack. The Duke d' Aumale and certain others followed the King, who about
four of clock after noone arrived at Paris, where the Guisians did exhort him
never more to trust the Huguenots, as himself made ample Protestation.

The Cardinal according to his custom would not follow the King, but fained to
take the way to Reyms: The secon^ civil war
howbeit being met by certain of his enemies, fled upon a iennet of Spain to
Chasteauthierry. Thus was the second war kindled in France, and
notwithstanding any the Prince of Condye or his adherents requests for the
reducing of al things into quiet, yet the Guisians and the Queen mother to the
end to be dispatched of one or other, caused a battle to be fought between
Paris and S. Dionice, wherein the Constable was wounded to death.

This day brought the Cardinal and his a great contentation, in that they saw
themselves rid of the Constable, and thereby the way open unto the
accomplishment of their desires. For on the one side, they endeavored to make
the King a sworn enemy unto the Protestants, who so much had stopped the
course of the Guisian preferrement, and so through him to overthrow their
adversaries. It was also requisite to have some other mighty man more at
commandment then the King, under whose authority they might shield themselves
in the execution of their passions. So sone therefore as the Constable was dead,
the Guisians counseled the Queen mother to make the Duke of Anjou the King his
brothers lieutenant general: and she perceiving what commodity thereby she
might reap, did soon follow this counsel. Whereupon the army marched, and the
Guisians wholly governed the Duke of Aniou, and under his shadow, both then and
ever since procured diverse fetches for the overthrow of the Protestants
chiefly. But hereafter we will show what injuries they have done to the said
Duke, in using him as an instrument to subvert al France.

Now forasmuch as the Protestants had presently succors out of Germany, The
seco^^ Edict of ^^cification
the Cardinal perceived that by going backward he might iumpe the farther, and
therefore when the Prince of Condes camp was before Chartres in the year 1568
he procured the King to send some men to the Prince to conclude a peace, that
is to say, to unarm the Protestants, whereby the more readily afterward to
murder them. For he could not deny but that the Protestants were at that time
the strongest, and yet not being compelled through want, either of strength or
good success, did separate and unarm them selves, opening their towns to
such as the Queen and the Cardinal sent in the Kings name, under whose only
faith and word, they put away from them al assurance of lives and goods,
yelding their naked breasts unto their adversaries swords and knives. All the
Protestant Lords and gentlemen departed to their own houses, whither when some
could not find any sure access, and others were so evil entreated, as that
diverse were most cruelly slain and murdered, many of them were constrained to
assemble themselves together (which was it that the Cardinal and his fautors
desired, as well to find occasion to slander them as infringers of the
Edictes, as also to the end the more easily by ouerrunning of them to destroy
them,) and not knowing what to do or whither to go, to take the way into
Flanders very indiscreetly, in that the King had forbidden them the same,
although they were through mere necessity, which (as the proverb is) has no
law, compelled thereunto. Howbeit the punishment was so ready and extreme,
that the Cardinal and his partakers ought to have been content. They used in
the execution thereof the Marshal de Cosse his aid, to the end to charge their
rage upon as well one as other. Then sent they a gentleman unto the Prince of
Conde, to know whether he allowed of the said levy of men, wherein is to be
seen a right Cardinals fetch, for the maintaining of the King in his rage,
expelling the Prince out of the Court, causing to ouerrunne him, or his troops
if he aduowed them, and so by little and little consume his enemies. As for the
strangers come to the Protestants aid, they were presently sent home, and the
Prince and other Protestants compelled to borowe great sums of money
wherewith to pay them: and yet through the Guisians commandments, the garrison
of Auxerre stole part of that money, slaying some of the guydes and ransomming
others, without any kind of justice, for the Lord of Pry governor of
Auxerre, where this great murder was committed, had the Cardinals word.

We will here now briefly rehearse the practices which the Guisians after the
second peace, The Cardinals pract^ses for the third troubles.
used for the more spedie dissoluing thereof, and reducing the Realm into new
troubles, thereby utterly to root out the Protestants and so to advance their
own affairs. Wherein we will recite part of the lamentation then published,
referring to the readers remembrance certain the particularities here omitted,
the number whereof is so great, that it is impossible for one man to think
upon them al. The strength therefore and certain assurance of this peace
consisted in that, that the King, his brethren and their mother should wholly
blot out al kind of mistrust conceived against the Protestants, wherein they
hoped that themselves had already taken a very good order, through their so
ready and spedie obedience in forsaking their weapons, sending away of such of
their power, as had been sufficient to have subdued the Guisians and other
their enemies, and in yelding those places wherein consisted their sauegard.
The Cardinal therefore to the end to prevent so great a commodity, which
undoubtedly had spoiled his attempts, tended only to the entertaining of the
King and the Duke of Anjou (for as for the Queen mother, she used her children
after the Guisians desire) in these mistrusts and mortal hatreds against the
Protestants, daily repeating and putting them in mind of new occasions.
Wherein he help him self with two virtues, which always he has been very
familiar withal, namely of boldness to invent al kind of lies, being still
assisted by men meet for his purpose in that respect: and of such shameless
assurance, that he would never be dashed out of countenance, notwithstanding
his falsehoods were detected. His practices which he has exercised for both
the entertainment and destruction of the nobility at once, his briberie and
exactions against the Clergy, and the goodly pretenses, under the which for
that purpose he has shrouded him self, shall be reueiled in place convenient.
In the mean time we will behold what injuries he and his have still done to the
King, and generallly to the whole Realm, wherein we will again speak of the
true complaints published thereagainst.

Soon after the peace, whereof the Cardinal sent his mother word, that he
would hinder the execution, he took order by certain preachers of his own
faction, that the people might be persuaded that it was a matter of conscience
to keep this peace, not only for that it was made with heretics and Atheists,
but also because through the necessity of time it was in manner wrested from
the King by force. This caused that sundry Catholics made no conscience of
putting of al natural affection, and that the most wicked finding the gate open
unto al theft and extorsions, did without stop run headlong into al kind
of mischiefs, and the most horrible violences in the world. Whereunto the
wincking of judges and parliaments, being for the most part subject unto the
Guisians, did greatly avail, insomuch that within three or four months
after, diverse persons of al estates professing the Religion were murdered, the
particularities whereof we will refer unto the history of our time. But in
this place are two notable particularities. Presently after the peace, the
Catholics of Amiens among other, murdered six or seven score Protestants of al
kinds, ages and conditions. Now to the end to make men believe, that they
sought to chastise and punish so wicked and cursed a deed, they sent thither
the Marshal de Cosse, who imprisoned the authors of this murder: but soon
after at the soliciting of the Cardinal, they were released and set at
liberty, for he in full counsel affirmed that they ought to take pity of
these poor prisoners, who through a godly zeal of Religion had been moved to
do this deed, and that him self would be the first that should sue for their
pardon, and so for a form of justice they caused to whippe three or four
rascals, whom they persuaded to confess what they were, and in picture
executed such as indeed ought to have been punished in person, who also were
present at the execution of their own pictures.

Toward the end of June in the same year 1568, was Rene of Sauoy Lord of
Sipierre murdered in Prouence, together with five and thirty gentlemen and
soldiers of his train, according to a certain precept which the Guisians
sent unto the Baron des Arts: and fiftene days before the said murder, the
Cardinal of Guise in much company said that they might already account the
Lord of Sipierre for a slain Captain, and that so they should shortly have
all the rest.

By these and infinite such other deeds, the Protestants in stead of being
taken into their houses with the freedom of conscience according to the Edict,
were now forced to fly, the towns being in stead of towns, become dens of
Tygres and Lions. And afterward the governors, parliaments and other
officers, whom the Cardinal used at his pleasure, and who also for the most
part were not very desirous to publish the peace, least thereby they should
lose the means to spoil after their usual manner, had their excuse ready:
namely that the people being thus moved already, it was not best to proceed
any farther for fear of marring all. In the mean while, the King him self
was not only entertained through a thousand false and impudent slanders in
the mistrust already conceived of his subjects, which is the greatest
mischief that may alight upon any Prince: but also contrary unto al royal
generositie, was put in fear and reduced to this point, that he was fully
persuaded that it was impossible that he should be thoroughly obeyed, unless
the one part of his subjects might be permitted to destroy the other, and
therefore it was an easy matter for the Cardinal to wrest the edict of peace
into an occasion of a thousand millions of troubles.

Moreover, the Cardinal foreseeing that if all the protestants should at once
be turned out at doors, they might assemble and fortify themselves again in
sundry places, therefore provided against that mischief as follows, yea, he
presumed to write into the provinces, that they should not credit the Kings
letters, unless they had some other assured tokens. First he procured the
edict by little and little to be published, sometime here and sometime there, to
the end to draw the most needy and simple persons into the towns: but with
this watchword, that the gates should be kept with arms eue^ more diligently
then during the wars, that they should utterly unarm the Protestants at
their entrye, that they should not permit any that once were entered, to get
forth again notwithstanding they abiured. And in all this the Cardinal was so
well obeyed, that few towns escaped without some manifest and open murder,
besides al other violences which were exercised, to the end to make the most
constant to revolt: which could not but come to pass when the sword was once
taken from the King and justice, and committed to the hands of the communaltie
with all immunitie. Also to the end to be assured that never a protestant might
escape, the Cardinal gave the King to understand that he should never remain
safe from the Huguenots practices, unless the towns which they had holden,
together with such as were their captains neighbors were furnished with good
and strong garrisons: so that this was no sooner counseled, but it was also
commanded. Also yet for their more assured deli^gs herin, if there were any
captain renowned for theuery, or cruelty, either any who had ever a private
quarrel, or any company given over to al lewdness, those were sure to be
preferred, how many soever there were of them, to the end to replenish the
towns so sone as they were yielded, or to lie about the houses of the Prince of
Condie, the Admiral and other Lords, whom the Cardinal hated, and stood in
most fear of. Also when one of the privy Council chanced to show the said
Cardinal that it was to be feared, least hereby the Protestants should over
soon perceive and smell that they would not observe the edict, also least the
Catholics should complain of being ouerpressed, the charges being so great
that the King were not able to bear them: he answered, saying, You know not
what you say. For the first of these two points, the answer is ready, namely
that it is for the mainteining of both parties in peace according to the edict:
and as for the second, for the Soldiers lodging among the Huguenots, and so an
hundred fould ouercharging of them, as touching Cottisings, all such matters
shall light upon their coffers: and howsoever it be, their confiscations shall
pay for all, and over and besides such recompenses, shall discharge the Kings
debts.

The Cardinal not yet content, to the end to keep the said lords of the
Religion from coming to the court, and more surely to provide for the
execution of his drifts, persuaded the King that his person should never be in
safety, without keeping him self as it were shut up in Paris for a time, and
not to stray away thence but by little and little. This when he had obtained, for
the better keeping of his prisoner, he made drawbridges, and other gardes in all
the ways and entries into Paris, as in time of open war.

Having thus framed his nets, he made an Edict in the Kings name, wherewith to
draw all the Protestants into the towns, there to murder them or keep them
prisoners in their own houses, at the mercy of a number of thieues, until the
appointed hour for the Sicilian euensong. And to the end men might the better
conceive hereof, we have set down the Edict, containing as follows. The Kin^
Edict of Cardina^ devising to what
Like as to procure the observing, interteyning and inviolable keeping of the
contents of our Edict, made for the pacification of the last troubles, chanced
in this our Realm among our subjects, we have heretofore written and sent
word unto our governors of our provinces our intent and pleasure as follows:
That the gates of our towns should be open unto such our subjects as do
profess the reformed Religion, and that them selves should be received and
settled in their houses in full possession of their goods, as before the said
troubles they were: leaving their weapons at the gates of the said towns,
according to an order which to that end we have sent into all parts and places
of our dominions. So now being since advertised, that sundry our subjects
of the said Religion, taking an opinion that they can not be received into the
said towns, either being entered, cannot tarry without being oppressed and
molested by other the inhabitants, have therefore retired into the fields
armed in great companies, there committing infinite evils and oppressions
against our poor people, so that it is to be feared least they may procure in
our Realm new troubles (whereunto desiring to provide as it is requisite,) we
have again said and declared, and now do say and declare that our intent
always was and still is: That the said of the Religion pretended reformed, as
well such as have borne arms, as all others comprehended in the bounds of our
Edict, shall have free entry, and be received into their mansion houses,
whereinto we will and do mean that they be admitted by the governors of our
provinces and towns, bayliefs, Seneschals and others our justices and officers
of the same, by whom they shall be summoned so to do with all gentleness
possible, maintained in peaceable possession and use of their said goods, and
preserved from all injuries and oppression: to the end that in all surety and
quietness, they may with other our subjects of the Catholic Religion, under
the benefit and according to the true meaning of our Edict of pacification,
live in all assurance and quietness: taking them into our protection and
sauegarde, and giving every man charge with the custody the one of the other.
Also in case any do go against this our determination, our will and pleasure
is that all such be punished with the extremity and rigor of our Edictes and
ordinances of whatsoever Religion that they be, without exception of persons.
Also wheresoever after these summons and calling, any shall be found enemies of
common tranquillity, or still keeping the fields, there to molest our
subjects, or to gather together in arms, to begin any new troubles: We will
and our intent is, that all our said governors of provinces and towns, all
Bayliefes, Seneschals and other our justices and officers, every man in his
own jurisdiction as to him appertains, shall assemble such numbers of men of
war, whether of men of arms, of footmen being in our pay, or inhabitants
of towns and villages, as they shall think convenient and necessary,
according to the aduertisements which they shall receive of the perfect number
of the said perturbers of the common quiet, for to ouerset them, and by all
such means as them selves shall think convenient, them overthrow and heaw in
pieces, in such wise as may be for our strength and obedience: For such is our
will and pleasure. Given at Paris the 19. of May 1568. Charles. Robertet.

This Edict contains infinite clauses and guiles of the Cardinal for the
rooting out of the Protestants, as well with in the towns as in the fields,
which the murders following, together with an other practice now to be seen,
did but over truly verify, to the great interest of the whole Realm, and
perpetual ignominy of the royal Name.

Al men do know that the profit of al countries consists especially in
trafike and merchandise, Other of the Cardinals sleigh^ for kindlin^ of the
thi^ civil warr^
which is the thing which most commends France above al countries in the
world. Now did one of the Articles of pacification import, that the towns
should immediately be restored into such estate as they were before the
troubles, and al trafike and merchandise restored. The Cardinal not being able
to abide that, and desirous that in France there might shortly appear as many
robberies, even at the Kings and his poor peoples costs, as there be bridges
and passages over rivers: To be brief, to the end there might be no traffic,
letters or purses which thirtene ribbauldes were not sufficient to visit from
one place to another, thereof to make report unto the said Cardinal, we must
mark what order he took, under color said he to keep the Protestants from
assembling together to conspire against the King. As indeed that was one
mark that he shot at, together with certain other more high attempts, in case
his enterprises against the Prince of Condye and the Admiral had had good
success. Howbeit the commission which then he procured, more manifestly did
reueile the injury which he did to the King and the realm: also his vehement
desire to trouble all the estate, to the end to exalt his own race through his
enemies overthrow. This therefore was the tenor of the commission, made about
the time of the edict before set down: namely in the month of May 1568. The
King has ordained captain N. in the town of N. there to remain Captain and
keeper of the bridge and passage: to whom shall be delivered twelve men to
assist his person, whom he may command whatsoever he thinks meet and
convenient for the Kings service. which twelve men his majesty shall pay, over
and besides the entertainment allowed to the said captain. He shall first
procure to make a drawbridge over the said passage, which he and his twelve
men shall day and night diligently and warily watch and keep: not
permitting any to pass unless he first know whence he comes, whither he
goes, what his business is and who himself is. Also seeing any numbers of
men approaching to the passage over the said bridge, he shall presently cause it
to be drawn, not suffering the passage to be taken before he be assured of the
same, and do know that they have no means to hurt him. Also to the end that
he and his twelve men with him may continually remain at the said bridge, with all convenient commodities, he shall immediately take order for the making of a
lodge near unto the said bridge, whither he and his soldiers may retire,
lodge and accommodate the^ selves, in not going from the said bridge or
abandoning the custody thereof: and to the same effect his majesty has
written to the inhabitants of the same town, that they at their own cost do
make the said lodge and drawbridge. Also forasmuch as it may greatly advantage
the said captain toward his sure keeping of the said bridge, and providing
that there be no means to surprise the same, to have knowledge of things done
in the said quarters, he shall endeavor to discover to his power the actions and
intentes of those of the new religion: and hearing of any thing prejudicial to
the Kings majesty's service, he shall look diligently to his charge, and give
warning unto the Captain of the next bridge, passage or town: and the like
shall all other captains do, who have commission for the keeping of any other
bridges or passages, til time the King be thereof advertised, so that he may
take some order. And although the principal cause which moved the King to
commit this captain to the charge of the bridge or passage aforesaid, is for
the safe custody thereof, yet shall he for his part take diligent heed, that
the Protestants have no preachings or other exercises of their religion, in any
other place then his majesty has to them ordained and established as well by
the contents of his edictes of pacification, as also by the rule prescribed
since the publication of the last edict. He shall hearken and take good head (as
much as possibly he may) that the protestants make no enroulings of men of
war, no leuyes or collections of coin, no unlawful assemblies, or no motions
of war, either where his charge lies, or in any other place thereabout: but
shall provide for faithful men to advertise him, and if need be to send some of
the skilfullest about him, and such as have any understanding, or do seem meet
to penetrate into the said Protestants affairs, to the end they may certify
him of whatsoever they can learn out. He shall endeavor to know whether there
be any gentlemen of the Kings side, that be displeased, or do show any
countenance to favor or follow the said protestants, any whom they have
suborned or motioned to make any practices or drifts te^ding to the surprising
of any the Kings towns, and have not disclosed the same, to the end to keep
the said practices or enterprises the more secret and farther from suspicion.
He shall also labor when the said Protestants do hold their Synodes and
assemblies, thoroughly to detect and understand the causes of the same, together
with the conclusions thereof. He shall find means to get in under such pretense
as he shall think best, some wise and trusty person, who may know and smell
out the end of their intentes, and give him a good account of all that has
been propounded or agreed upon in the said assemblies. he shall take heed that
there be no assemblies made in any town or place forbidden and defended,
either any secret exercise of their religion. To the end also that his majesty
may be served as appertains, and with good knowledge among his trusty and
faithful subjects, the said captain shall often commune with the governor who
has the charge of the town, of such matters as may fall out touching his said
majesty's service, and the one not to encroche upon the others authority, lest
any displeasure or controversy should breed between the said governor and
him. He shall curiously enquire who be the superintende^ts over the protestants
affairs in the said country, what their pensions are, and whether they do send
any messengers into foreign countries, and to what end. He shall also certify
the King of al such matters as he has learned, touching any the said matters
or other things tending to his majesty's service, neither shall he fail of
sending weekly one or more messengers according as matters shall fall out: and
the same shall he address to my Lord the Kings brother and lieutenant general,
who shall give him answer. And the said captain may certify the King and my
said lord his brother of all that he knows by se^ding his letters to him that
shall have the custody of the next bridge, and so from hand to hand shall the
same be conveyed by other captains having like commission, unto the King, or
my Lord his brother.

Now may any man having wit or discretion consider in this co^missio^ wonderful
policies of ye Cardinal, and new preparatiues for war, by ye means whereof he
advanced him self. Also how by these drifts ye third civil war was sone
ki^dled, for in less the^ two months after ye peace, there were above ten
thousand persons slain here and there: and in the mean time ye Cardinal
boasted that he would kill more between two trestles, the^ ye King could with al
his power: and sent word ordinarily to Rome and other places, that they had
dispatched more Huguenots in one day during the peace, then in one month
whiles the wars continewed.

Besides all this, The lea^ of the C^tholiks.
the Cardinal doubting lest the Catholics would not sufficiently rebel,
procured them to make brotherhoodes, leagues, and associations, wherein sundry
of the Parliaments and nobility assisted them, gathering together of money,
giving their oaths, enrowling of soldiers, together with such other matters
concerning the entertainment of their brotherhoodes, which they called of the
holy Ghost. As in the town of Dijon through the driftes of the Lord of
Tauannes, and one named Begad a counselour of the parliament, the like league
was made, and when certain standers by demanded whether it were by the Kings
authority, the said Begad answered, that he had his majesty's letters for that
purpose, which Tauannes had delivered to one of his secretaries, who the^ could
not be found. Also that though the King liked not thereof, yet they need not to
fear, for he knew well enough whither else to repair. Morouer, yt they were not
to regard such letters as the King ordinarily writ to ye said Tauannes, or
unto the court of Parliament, te^ding to the observation of ye edict, for they
contained another mystery which al ye world understood not. The like was also
done in Bourgundy and other places.

In the mean time the exercise of religion was forbidden in the hie and low
countries of Auuergne and in all other parts pertaining to the kings brethren,
Couns^ the de^tion o^ Fran^
and to certain Princes of the blood. In other provinces were daily
preparations for ye apprehending of the principal, and yet by letters directed
unto such gouerners as had ye wachword, they were charged to let the gentlemen
of the Religion understand, that the Kings mind was well to entreat them, and
to maintain them in the exercise of their Religion, thereby giving them to wit,
that he accounted them as his faithful and good subjects and servants: and that
such broils as they heard of, tended only to the assuring of his estate
against sundry towns men, insolent and seditious persons, and so afterward to
the restoring of al things into quiet estate, and to the favoring of the
nobility as well of the one as other Religion, for that they are his principal
strength, causing them to live in agreement under the authority of his
Edictes. These now were fair words: but least certain Catholics, not being
sufficiently trained in the Cardinal and his adherents affairs, hearing such
letters, might quail, there were also other secret letters, sent with
commandment to communicate the same unto such, as were accounted meet to be
called to like accomptes. This enterprise did the Cardinal also communicate
unto the Cardinal of Crequies agent at the Castle of Madrit in August 1568,
whereof the said agent did at large write unto his master: the very words of
his letter which was surprised and brought to the Prince of Conde, have we here
set down. They have (said the Cardinal to this agente) taken good order
every where, that the King may remain master, that the chief may be caught,
and all opportunity of gathering together taken from them, to the end that
having brought them to that point, as by the order already taken it will be
easy to do, we may then utterly root out this vermin (for so did the
Cardinal call the Protestants) being enemies unto God, the King and the
estate, and not leave one infected person in the Realm, because it is such a
seed as still will budde out new mischief, unless we should take this
way, whereof our neighbors do set before us so goodly examples. Attending
which time, that can not be past this month, it is thought best in all the
provinces to speak fair to the principal of them, and to such of the
Nobility as seem least affected to the said Religion, thereby only to
content them in dalying, and as much as may be lulling them on sleep, as
already diverse have hearkened thereto, and do begin to assure them selves:
yea some come, and of their own accord do burn their wings in the candle,
and yet do we hope well that more will do the like, who we know are already
shaken. This way undoubtedly we shall sone win our process, and obtain
assured victory, without any great labor or resistance against the enemies of
our faith. These were the Cardinals fetches, which together with diverse other
practices, whereof we will in more convenient place make mention, did kindle the
fire of the third civil wars, being of longer continuance and more tedious
then the rest.

The Prince of Conde toward the end of the same month, The third civil war^
in great haste saved him self by departing from Noyers in Bourgundie, where
he should have been enclosed within two days after, and gat to Rochell,
against which place, the Cardinal had already practiced many things, but he
troubled his head in vain. Then was the war open: and while they prepared to
cause the Catholic army to march under the conduct of the Duke of Anjou, the
Cardinal devised two Edictes published both in one day in the Parliament of
Paris, namely the 28. of September, to wit, the third day after that they had
been framed in the council. In the first, the King making a long discourse of
things happened in his Realm through the Religion, declares among other
things, that the Edict of January, wherein he granted the Protestants leave to
exercise their Religion, was but prouisionall attending his maiority: also that
now he was no longer minded to permit the edictes touching Religion to stand
any longer in force. Also that now being come to his maioritye, he forbids
all exercise of the same within his dominions, willing perpetually that there
be no other exercise of Religion, saving the Roman in all his jurisdictions,
under pain of confiscation of body and goods. Also under like penalty, he
charge al ministers of the said Religion, to avoid his Realm within
fifteen days: forbidding nevertheless that any of the said Religion be
researched in their consciences, so long as peaceably they will live in their
houses. In the other he declared that from that time forward he did not intend
to use the service of any of the said Religion, and thereby did suspend them
from their offices and functions: commanding them to come, and give up the same
into his hands within fifteen days, or else him self would otherwise
provide. These two Edictes had long been upon the file, and the Cardinal a
far of showed the same to the Catholics, to move them to come to the
offering, and to bring in coin for the armies pay, wherein he, the Queen
mother, and their mynions used their wonted sportes. But these Edictes were
more prejudicial to the Catholics then they supposed, for most of the
Protestants, who otherwise were not determined to have gone out at the doors,
behoulding this so manifest periurye, wherewith the Cardinal diffamed the house
of Valois, took the fields presently. Also the Protestante Lords sent these
Edictes into England and Germany, as assured testimonies that they were not
pursued, as seditious persons or aspirers unto the crown (as before it had
been noysed) but as defenders of the Gospel, which the Catholics endeavored to
root out of France. This was all that the Cardinal or his adherents gate
thereby. About this time, were many writings published against the presumptuous
and ambitious cruelty of the Guisians, but chiefly against the Cardinal, whose
nature was amply described by a certain learned French Poet, in a certain
Sonnet comprehending a curse in the end.

And for that the said Sonnet is pretty, and never yet to my knowledge was put
in print, I have here presented the same to the Reader.

Qui l'anime, l'eschauffe, and conduit son dessein,
Rien que fer, rien que feu, rien que sang ne resonne.
Puisse-il par le fer cruellement mourir,
Ou par le feu du ciel horriblement perir,
Et voir du sang des siens la terre estre arrouset:
Et soit rouille, estaint, and seche par la paix,
Le fer, le feu, le sang, cruel, ardant, espais,
Qui tue, ard and rougit la France dissipee.
This third civil war beginning in October 1568, continewed to the beginning
of August 1570, the historye whereof has been at large written and published,
wherein is to be seen how the Catholics and Protestants have one destroyed
the other, by viewing what battailles have been fought, what places besieged
and taken, or what captains and soldiers have been slain: so that the
Frenchmen have committed against them selves, that which peradventure all other
nations in Europe together could not have accomplished. Whiles in the mean
time the Cardinal beheld this bloody tragedy, and practiced all means to
make the one part to destroy the other. And for that it would be an infinite
labor to describe all his driftes, it shall now suffice to consider part of
his subtilties used during this third civil war.

First he assured him self of the Kings person, whom he led hither and
thither according as things fell out, and so provided that nothing might be
done without his advice. He served also in stead of a firebrand to kindle the
King more and more against the Protestants, chiefly against the chief of them,
in whose respect he practiced all kind of violences and treasons for the
compassing of his purposes. Some being taken prisoners were (notwithstanding
all vowed faith) slain, others were poisoned, against others were murderers
hiered, unto whom the Cardinal gave great rewards.

Then gatte he many servants about the Duke of Anjou the Kings lieutenant
general, by whom he might incense the said Duke against the Protestants. This
was of so dangerous consequence unto the Prince of Conde, that finally it cost
him his life. For Montesquiou, the said Dukes Captain of his guard, slew the
Prince, whom the lords of Argence, and of S. John had taken prisoner. Under
the same policy the said Duke would grant no safe conduite unto the lord de
l'Estrange, the deputy in the behalf of the Protestant Lords and Princes in
June 1569, who should have gone to present their supplication to the King, as
touching such means and remedies, as he knew most convenient and profitable
for appeasing of the war, and establishing of a perfect peace.

The same policye did the Cardinal use in hindering the concluding of the
peace: For being certified that the Admiral had sent the said supplication to
his cousin the Marshal of Montmorency, that he might offer the same to the
King, he prevented the said Marshal, alleging unto the King, that it was no
reason that such rebellious subjects should speak to the King afar of, also
that unless they came and yielded them selves to his mercy, they were not to
be heard, but with weapons to be subdued. According to which counsel the King
showed the said Marshall of Montmore^cy, that he would neither look upon, or
hear any thing that came from the Protestants, but chiefly from the Admiral,
before he had taken them to favor, which he would do in case they would yield
to do their duties: as if before the said Admiral and his men had not most
earnestly entreated the King, like as now again in this supplication they did,
for these words were therein contained: They do most humbly desire your
Majesty to grant, and generally permit to all your subjects of what estate
or condition so ever they be, free exercise of their religion in all towns,
villages and boroughes, and in all other parts and places of your realm and
countries in your obedience and protection, without exception, moderation or
restraint of persons, time or place, with all requisite and necessary
assurance. And moreover to ordeyne and inioine al men, openly to profess
either the one or the other religion, thereby to cut of diverse, who abusing
this benefit and favor, are fallen into Atheism and all carnal liberty,
having freed them selves from the exercise and profession of al religions,
being desirous to see nothing but confusion in this realm, together with the
overthrow and suppression of all order, policy, and ecclesiastical
discipline, which is a most pernicious and dangerous matter, utterly
intolerable. Also, dear Lord, for as much as the said Princes, Lords,
Knights, Gentlemen and other in their companies, doubt not but they, who
hitherto have planted the foundations of their practices upon such slanders as
impudently they do publishe, to the end to procure the said Princes to be
brought into the hatred and displeasure, even of such as through the grace of
God, are freed from all bondage and tyranny of Antichrist, will not fail but
affirm that they will rather stiffly without reason defend whatsoever they once
have determined to believe, touching the Articles of Christian religion, then
correct and withdraw them selves, therefore the aforesaid Princes, Lords,
Knights, Gentlemen and other their company do declare and protest, as always
they have done, that if in any one point of the confession of faith heretofore
presented to your Majesty by the reformed churches of your realm, they may be
instructed, that by Gods word comprehended in the Canonical books of the holy
scripture, they have strayed from the doctrine of the Apostles or Prophets,
they will readily yield and willingly grant to such as by Gods word may better
instruct them, then in the beginning they have been, if they do err in any
article. And for this cause do desire nothing so much as a convocation of a
free, general and lawful council, wherein every man may be heard allege their
reasons, which must be either confirmed, or convinced by the only word of God,
according to the manner used in all times for like occasions.

In the mean time the Cardinal brought up the Duke of Aniou at the charges of
the Clergy and Catholics, to the end to destroy the Protestants, and to get a
new string unto his bow, wherewith he might shoot at other matters, in case the
war had such success as he wished. For as for peace he accounted it
impossible and past hope of being concluded, without the utter destruction and
abolishing of the contrary faction. Now sought he continually to cloak his
private interest, and to cause the King to think it impossible to come to any
peace, and so consequently to hazard all things rather then to yield so much,
and to that end propounded two great lets. The first taken of the contrariety
of religion, which (said he) neither could nor ought to be borne withal in the
realm. The other derived from the Kings majesty's fame, which (said he) the
protestants had blemished, and therefore it was impossible for them to salve up
such a wound, unless laying down their weapons, they came in haulters about
their necks to submit them selves to the Kings mercy, sitting in his seat of
the Cardinals justice. But he alleged these reasons (to the which the
protestants have often sufficiently answered) not so much for any zeal to
religion, whereof in the books following we will more amply entreat, neither
for any affection to the King against whom he conspired, but rather because
that before he granted to any motion of peace, he would be assured that
howsoever matters went, he and his would keep the chief room in the counsel
of the King and realm, that he might put out or in, the officers of the crown
at his own discretion, that he might ordeine and dispose the law and
treasury, as seemed best to his covetous appetite: to be brief, that the
realm might of him take laws to do or not to do, to speak or not to speak,
and at one word, that at his pleasure he might remove both souls, bodies and
goods, both of the head and members of the said Realm.

He feared also least the King should give ear unto the declarations of the
Protestants deputies, whereby in time he might easily perceive, that those
counseilers who have given him to understand, that the only means to
extinguishe in his realm all diversity of Religion, was through war, were
Atheistes, or else brainelesse persons wholly ignorant even to the end. Also
least the King might call to mind how that since the said Cardinals return
from the Council of Trent, the whole body of his privy council has been
divided and parted into two several opinions, the one part wishing for peace,
the other for war: and therefore the Cardinal and his adherentes might be
the worse entreated. Wherefore he resolved together with his partakers, so much
as might be to prolong the war, thereby to corrupt and frame the King after
his own appetite, and so destroy the Protestants, thereby to prepare the
readier path to the performance of his secret driftes. He persuaded him self
in time to conquer the said Protestants. First, being driven out of most
towns in the Realm, and reduced into the extremities of the same in a little
corner of Saintonge, they might easily be enclosed in this small quantity of
ground, by means of such rivers and towns as do abbut upon the Marches of
Angoulmois and the places thereabout: so that being once raunged within such
bars, the famine and infection of the air, raised through the vapoures of
their troops and companies, should within few months force them to come in
with haulters about their necks, and so to yield them selves to his
discretion and mercy. Then that the principal strength of the Princes camp
consisting in strangers, for the payment of whose arrearages already due unto
the^, until then the protestants had almost drawn their purses dry, and
therefore had small opportunity in time to come to satisfy the^: they of
friends should become foes, which easily might be compassed, and they be
entised if not to fight with the Protestants, yet at the least upon payment of
their duties to return home into their own countries. Finally, the Cardinal
grounded the prolo^ging of the war upon the uncertain hazard of battayles,
by reason of inconveniences of his own part. All such as considered that now
all the French Nobility, and the chief part of their warriors were already in
the fields upon the point, in case any battle should be fought, to murder one
an other, did bewail the miserable estate of the King and his Realm, who
leaned to their subversion through the hap of such a meeting, to whom soever
the victory fell. But the Cardinal and his faction made so small account
hereof, that they could have wished that the part lying upon the ground, had
left the conquerours so wounded, that they might never have risen again: not in
hope to have created any new French nobility with a sheet of paper, or a
skin of parchement, and four ounces of wax (according to the Cardinals
apophthegme, which was that the King was able in one hour to create more
Gentlemen, then in ten years space might be consumed in the wars) but
rather for that that the said French nobility being extinguished, the way
would be the readier unto the accomplishme^t of the Guisians forecastes, and
through the supporte of the Mayres, Sheriffs, and Counsaylours of the most
part of the towns in France, of long time affectionate unto the Cardinal, like
as were the courts of Parliament, under pretense of maintayning the Catholic
Church, they might challenge the title to the Crown, the which they have so
long boasted to appertain unto the house of Lorraine, by virtue of an
imaginatiue succession from the stock of Charles the great: Howbeit the
Cardinal fearing least the battle should be tried rather in the manner of a
fraie, and dispersion of one of the armies, then by any great bloodshead,
thought best to assure him self through delays in prolo^ging the time, rather
then to build his full hope upon so wavering and dangerous a foundation. For
if the victory had fallen to the Protestants, the Guisians would have
accounted them selves undone: also if the Cardinals army had gotten the best,
then did he forecast that their fury being over, some of the Catholics might
have commenced as dangerous a quarrel against him as that, and again require of
him the lives of such Lords and Gentlemen, as peradventure had been offered upon
the altar of his ambition. For all they that served the Duke of Anjou, were not
so bent unto the Guisians service, as the said Cardinal and his adherents could
have wished.

Thus did the Cardinal spin this cord of Civil wars, and draw it as long as
he could, notwithstanding that in his considerations there passed great
ouersights, which here I will neither detect, neither confute, for that is the
office of some such person as has leisure to devise some politic discourses,
and reveal the blindness of the French Catholic Gentlemen, who in professing
them selves men of experience and practice, have suffered a priest to baffulle
them, who was more cowardly then a woman, and who also in his sleeue in the
company of his familiar friends with open throat scorned them, as in place
convenient we shall hereafter see.

The Duke d'Aumale was upon the borders of Bourgundy and Lorraine, accompanied
with great troops over whom he commanded, and there waited to stop the
passage of the Reistres, who came to the protestants aid. Wherein he had as
good success as in other his martial deeds: For his soldiers openly said
that he had more flesh then wit or courage. And in deed notwithstanding he
were in a convenient country for his footmen, of whom there were a great
number, and those trained soldiers, yet did he nothing worth the speaking of,
but sundry times was in danger of being well beaten, yea he refused to meet
with his enemies in a place greatly to his advantage. But to say the truth,
the Cardinal was also one cause of these kind of dealings, for he minded not
that they should so soon come to handy blows, but hoped either to win the
strangers, or else to find them at a better advantage, and so sought more and
more to shuffle the cards, whereby he might meet with the better game.

As for the young Duke of Guise, through his great favor with the Duke of
Anjou, proceeding of their straight acquaintance, besides that he was great
master, he was now highly advanced. His uncle also placed about him many
captains, who at Poictiers stood him in good stead. The Marquise of Maine his
younger brother, was then through his youth of no countenance. The great Prior
and the Marquise d'Ellebeufe his uncles were dead a while before, neither were
they greatly regarded, as men having no more wit then their brother the
Cardinal of Lorraine had bestowed upon them, neither were they factious, but as
he taught and commanded them.

But at all adventures, we have extended this matter far enough in this first
part of the legende of the lords of Guise: We will therefore permit the
readers to take breath, and give our pen some respite, whereby to proceed in
the rest, namely of the behauiours of the Cardinal and his adherents in the
third Edict of pacification, also of their means to atteine unto the murder at
S. Bartlemewes day: also of such things as of their parts have since chanced
to the confusion of King Charles and his estate. Also of the evil pranckes
which they have played with King Henrye the third now reigning, with all the
princes of the blood, the great Lords, the Nobilitye, the Justices, the
Clergy, the people as well of the one as of the other Religion, their fautours
and friends, yea and one of them selves with an other. Here before we have
seen part of their dealinges under Francis the first, Henry the second,
Francis the second, and Charles the ninthe: but the sundry particularityes,
which shall be set down in the other books following, will show that in this
first part we have only touched the matters, and described as it were the
entrye into the bloody, villainous and accursed palace of the Guisians. Let
this therefore be the beginning of a greater work, and I would to God that by
this that is past, the Frenchmen might (though somewhat late and to their cost)
know part of those instruments wherewith the Lord for their offenses has
scourged them, to the end that returning unto him as they ought, they might
receive sooner then I hope for, some rest and ease.

FINIS.
