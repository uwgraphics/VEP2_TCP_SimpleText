lytyl John sith your tender enfancye
Stondeth as yet under / in difference
To vice or virtue to meuyn or apply
And in such age there is no providence
Ne comenly no sad Intelligence
But as wax resseyueth prynte or figure
So children ben disposid of nature
Vice or virtue to follow and enpresse
In mind / and therefore / to styre and remeue
You from vice / and to virtue address
That one to follow / and that other teschewe
I have devised you / this lytyl new
Instructo^n / acordyng unto your age
Plain in sentence / but playner in la^gage
Take heed therefore / and herkne what I say
And give thereto / your good aduertence
Let not your ere be here and your heart away
But put ye thereto / besy diligence
Leyng aparte al wantown Iusolence
Lerneth to be virtuous / and well thewed
Who will not learn / nedely he must be lewed
Before all thing / and principally
In the morenyng / when ye up rise
To worshipe god / have in memory
With crystes cross / look ye bless you thrice
Your pater noster / say in devout wise
Aue maria / with the holy creed
Then all the day / the better shall ye speed
And while that ye be about honestly
To dress your self / and do on^ your array
With your felawe / well and tretably
Our lady matyns / look that ye say
And this obseruan^ce / use ye every day
With pryme and ouris / withouten dread
The blessid lady / will quyte you your mede
Kembe your head / and look ye keep it clean
Your eres tweyne / suffer not fowl to be
In your visage / wait no spot be seen
Purge your nose / let noman in it see
The vile matter / it is none honest
Ne with your bare hand / no filth fro it fecche
For that is fowl / and an vnairtoys teache
Your hondes wesshe / it is an holsom thing
Your naylis look / they be not gety black
Ne fusfre not hem / to be over long growyng
To your array / I warn you good head take
That manerly ye fytte it up and make
Your hood. gown. hosyn / and eke your sho
With all your array longyng your body to
Keep you clean / and lose not your gere
And or ye pass / out of your loggyng
Every garment / that ye shall on were
Awayte well / that it be so syttyng
As to your degree / seems acordyng
Then will men say / forsooth this childr is he
That is well taught / and louyth honest
And as ye walk / and pass by the street
Be ye not nyce of chere / and countenance
But look my child / to folks that ye mete
Ye speak fair / with words of plesaunce
Demure and curtoys / of your demenaunce
To him that is your felawe and pere
Eyue ye fair langage / and afrendly chere
Cast no styck ne stone at foul ne be
And where ye walk / bewarre ye ne rage
For if ye do / ye shall to brecheles feast
Terre not with hou^d in field ne in vilage
Go forth your way / demenyng your viage
In sobre wise / that men may of you say
A goodly child / there passes by the way
And when ye come to ye church my litil child
Holy water / ye shall upon you cast
Before ye cross / with chere meke and mylde
Knele adoun^ / and knock on your breast
Thankyng the good lord yt on it did rest
And there / for you susfryd his sides to blede
Say ye or ye rise / pater noster / aue / and a creed
Auyse you well also / for any thing
The church of prayer / is house and place
Beware therefore / of clappe or Iangelyng
For in ye church / it is a full great trespaas
And a token of such / as lackyth grace
There be ye demure / and keep ye scilence
And serve ye god / with all your diligence
To help the priest / when he says mass
When it shall happen you or betyde
Remeue not fer / ne from his presence pass
Knele or stand ye / devoutly him beside
And not to nygh your tongue must be applide
Tanswere him / with boys full moderate
Auyse you well / my lityl child algate
To mynystre / with devout reverence
Look ye do / your humble obseruan^ce
Debonairly / with due obedyence
Circumspectly / with every circumstaunce
Of poort and chere / of goodly countenan^ce
Remembryng well the lord / a boue is he
Whom to serve / is grettest liberte
And when ye speak / look men in the face
With sobre chere / and goodly semblaunce
Cast not your eye a side / in other place
For that is a token of wantoun^ inconsia^ce
Which will appeyre your name and disauan^ce
The wise man says who has these thi^gis three
Is not like a good man for to be
In heart he seith / who that is inconstan^te
A waueryng eye / glydyng suddenly
Fco place to place / and afoot varian^te
That in no place / abides stably
These ben ye signs / the wisema^ seith sikerly
Of such a wight / as is unmannerly nyce
And is full likely disposid unto vice
Awayte my child / when ye stand at table
Of master or souerayn / whether it be
Appl ye you for to be seruysable
That no defaute in you founden be
Look / who does best / and him ensiewe ye
And in especyal / use ye attendaunce
Wherein ye shall your self best auaunce
As ye be commanded / so do ye algate
Be not causeles / fro the table absent
It is a great pleasure / to the high estate
To see his seruauntis about him present
Haunte no halke / for then^e ye will be shente
Let manner and mesure / be your gydes tweyne
So shall ye best plese / I dar sauely seyne
Reward also the look and contenaunce
Of your master / or of your souereyne
So shall ye best preue. what is his plesan^ce
Or else displesaunce / this is soth serteyne
The chere discouerith / often both tweyne
And eke ye chere / sometime may you address
In thi^gis / yt la^gage may not them express
And that ye her look / keep always secree
Besy report / of mischief is chief noryse
Mykyl langage / may not al fawtles be
Then^e do my child / as techeth you the wise
Which unto you / this lesson does deuyse
Here and see / and be still in every prees
Pass forth your way in scilence and in pees
And yet in adventure / if the caas require
Ye may speak / but ye must then percaas
Seven co^dico^ns observe / as ye may now hyre
Auyse you well / what ye say / and in what place
Of whom / and to whom in your mind co^pace
How ye shall speak / and when take good head
This con^celith the wise man without dread
Awayte my child / ye be have you manerly
When at your mete / ye sit at the table
In every prees and in every company
Dispose you to be so compenable
That men may of you veporte for conme^dable
For trusts well / upon your beryng
Men will you blame or give preysyng
And prynte ye trewly your memory
For a princypal point of fair noreture
Ye deprave no man absent especyally
Saint austyn amonessleth with besy cure
How men at table / should hem assure
That there escape them / no such langage
As might other folk hurt to disparage
This curtoys clerk / writes in this wise
Rebukyng the vice / of vile detracco^n
What man it be / that of custom and guyse
Hurts with tunge / or by foul colusio^n
Thabsente / weyue ye for that abusion^
Such a detractour / from the table
As unworthy / and also reprochable
When ye sit therefore at your repaste
Annoye ye noman present nor absente
But speak ye few / for if ye make waste
Of large langage / for sothe ye must be shent
And when ye speak / speak ye with good e^te^t
Of matters acordyng unto plesance
But nothing / that may cause men greuan^ce
Eschew also tacches of foul raueyne
Of gredy lust / with vncurteys appetyce
Prece not to sone / fro your viand restreyne
Your hand a while / with manerly respite
Feed you for necessite / and not for delight
Demene you with mete / and drink so sobrely
That ye not ben enfecte with glotony
Enbrewe not your vessel / ne your naprye
Over manner and mesure / but keep hem clean
Ensoyle not your cup / but keep it clenlye
Let no fat farsione / on your lips be seen
For that is foul / ye wot what I mean
Or than ye drink / for your owen honest
Your lips wype / and clenly look they be
Blow not in your dri^ke ne in your potage
Ne farse not your dishe to full of bread
Bear not your knyf / to ward your visage
For therein is parell / and mykyl dread
Clawe not your visage / touch not your head
With your bare hand / sittyng at table
For in norture / such thing is reprouable
Lose not your gyrdel / sittyng at your mete
For that is a tacche / of vncurtesye
But if ye seem / ye be embraced streite
Or than ye sytte / amend it secretly
So covertly that no wight you espy
Beware also / no breath fro you rebounde
Up ne doun^ / lest ye were shameful found
Be ye hushed in chamber / scylent in halle
Harken well and give good audience
If vssher or marchal for any rumor call
Put ye Ianglers to rebuke for silence
Be ye myld of langage / demure of eloquence
Enforce you unto him conformed to be
That can most good / and has humanyte
Touch not with your mete / salt t^ the saler
Lest folk apoynte you of vnconnyngnesse
Dress it aparte / upon a clean trencher
Farse not your mouth to full / for wa^tonesse
Lene not upon the table / for that rude is
And if I shall to you plainly say
Over the table / ye shall not spetel conueye
Yef ye be served / with metes delicate
Depart with your fellow / in gentil wise
The clerck says / nature is content and saciate
With mean diete / and litil shall susfyse
Depart therefore / as I you deuyse
Engrose not / unto your self all
For gentilnes / will aye be liberal
And when percaas your seruise is not large
Gruccheth not / with frownyng contenan^ce
Ne make thereof / not to mykyl charge
Dispose you to goodly suffran^ce
And what ye have / take it in suffysan^ce
Be ye plesid with such as god has you sent
He has enough / that can hold him content
Burnysshe no bones / with your teth / beware
Such houndis tacchis / fall of vncurtesye
But with your knyf / make the bones bare
Handle your mete / so well and so clenly
That ye offend not the company
Where ye be set / as ferforth as ye can
Reme^bryng well / that manners make man^
And when that / ye ete your mete small
With open mouth / beware ye not ete
But look your lips / be closed as a wall
When to and fro / ye trauerse your mete
Keep you so cloos / that men have no co^seite
To say of you / any langage or vilonys
Because ye ete your mete / unmannerly
Beware my child / of laughyng over mesure
Ne at the board / ye shall no naylis pare
Ne pyke your teth / with knyf / I you eusure
Ete at your mess / and other folks spare
A gloton can but make the bones bare
And of enough / he takes never head
He fedith more for lust / than for need
And when ye board is thynne / as of seruyse
Naught replenesshed with great diversity
Of mete and dri^ke good chere may then^ fuffise
With honest talkyng / and also ought ye
With gladsom chere / then fulsom for to be
The poet says / hou that a pour board
Men may enriche / with chereful will and word
And one thing my child / ye understand
In especyall / for your own honest
In the water / wasshe so clean your hand
That your towel / never enfoyled be
So foul / that it be lothsom on to see
Wasshe with water / your hondes so cleene
That in the towel shall no spotte be seen
Let not your spone / in your disshe sto^ding
Ne upon the table / it should not lie
Let your trenchour / be clean for any thing
And if ye have chan^ge / yet as honestly
As ye can / make a wide manerly
So that no fragme^t / fro your tre^cher fall
Do thus my child / in chamber and in halle
And when another man / spekith at table
Beware ye enterrupte not / his langage
For that is a thing discomendable
And it is no sign of folks sage
To be of langage / besy and outrage
For the wise ma^n said / in his sentence
He should be wise / that gives audience
Understand therefore or than ye speak
Prynte in your mind / clerly the sentence
Who that uses / a man's tale to break
Lets vncurteysly / all the audyence
And hurts him self / for lack of science
He may not give answer conuenyente
That herith not finally / what is mente
But beware my child / also of rehersayll
Of matters / which ben at table meuid
It greuith often / and does men disauayle
Full many a man / yt vice has myscheuid
Of evil thing said / is werse contryuid
Such reportis / always my child eschew
As may of old fre^dis / make enemies new
Advise you well when ye take your disporte
Honest gamee / that ye haunte and use
And such as ben of vylayns report
I counceyl you my child / that ye refuse
For trust ye well / ye shall you not excuse
From brecheles feste / and I may you espy
Playng at any game of rybawdrye
It is to a godly child well syttyng
To use disportes of myrthe and plesan^ce
To harp or lute / or lustely to sing
Or in the prees right manerly to dance
When men se a child of such governance
They say / glad may this chyldis fre^dis be
To have a child / so manerly as is he
Excersise your self also in redyng
Of books enorned with eloquence
There shall ye find / both plesir and lernyng
So that ye may / in every good presence
Somewhat find / as in sentence
That shall acorde / the time to ocupy
That ye not need / to stonden ydelly
It is fair / for to be comyn^catyf
In matters unto purpose acordyng
So that a wight seem excers if
For trusts well / it is a tedyous thing
For to here a child / multeplye talkyng
If it be not to the purpose applied
And also with / goodly termys alyed
Redeth gower in his writing moral
That anucyent fader of memory
Redeth his books / called confessionall
With many another virtuous trayttye
Full of sentence / set full fructuosly
That him to read / shall give you courage
He is so full of fruit* sentence and langage
O fader and founder of ornate eloquence
That enlumened have all our bretayne
To soon we lost / thy laureate science
O lusty lyquour / of that fulsom fontayne
O cursid death / why have thou yt poet slain
I mean fader chaucer / master galfryde
Alas the while / that ever he from us did
Redeth his werkis / full of plesaunce
Clear in sentence / in langage excellent
Briefly to write / such was his suffysan^ce
What ever to say / he took in his entente
His langage was so fair and pertynente
It seems unto mannys heeryng
Not only the word / but verily the thing
Redeth my child / redeth his books all
Refuses none / they ben expedyente
Sentence or langage / or both find ye shall
Full delectable / for that good fader mente
Of al his purpose / and his hole entente
How to plese in every audyence
And in our tunge / was well of eloquence
Behold Ocklyf in his translacon^
In goodly langage / and sentence passing wise
How he gives his prince / such exortacon^
As to the highest / he could best deuyse
Of truth* pees* mercy* and Justise
And virtues / leetyng for no slouthe
To do his deuoir and quite him of his truth
Required him / as against his sovereign
Most drad and louyd / wos excellent hyenes
He aduertysed / by his writing plain
To virtue / apperteynyng to nobles
Of a prince / as bears good witness
His traytye / entitled of regymente
Compyled of entyer true entente
Look also / upon dan John lydgate
My master whylome / monk of berye
Worthy to be renomed / as poet laureate
I pray to god in bliss his soul be mercy
Syngyng Yex splendens that heavenly kyrye
Among the muses nine celestyall
Before the highest Jubyter of all
Passing the muses nine of Elycon^
Where is non pareyl of armonye
Thider I trust my meistres soul begone
The sterrid paleys / above the dapplyd sky
There to sing sanctus incessantly
Among the muses ix celestyall
Before the highest / Jubiter of all
Redeth his volumes / that been large and wide
Seueryly set / in sadness of sentence
Enlumyned with colors fressh on every side
Me lacks wit / I have none eloquence
To give him lawde / after his excellence
For I dar say / he left him not a live
That could his co^nyng / sufficiently discriue
But his werkis / his laud / must need co^quere
They may never / out of remembrance dye
His werkis shall his name conueye and bear
About the world / almost eternely
Let his owe^ werkis preyse him and magnefie
I dar not preyse / for fere lest I offend
My la^gage / should rather apeyre than amend
Loo my child / these faders auncyente
Repen the feldes fresshe of fulsomnes
The flours fresh they gadred up and hente
Of silver langage / the great riches
Who will it have my lityl child doutles
Must of hem beg / there is no more to say
For of our tunge / they were both lok and kaye
There can noman^ now her werhis disteyne
The enbamed tunge / and aureate sentence
Men get it now / by cantelmele and gleyne
Here and there by besy diligence
And feign would reche / her craft of eloquence
And by the gleyne / it is full often seue
In whose field / the gleyners have bent
And unto me / age has bode good morrow
I am not able clenly / for to gleyne
Nature is fayn^ of craft / her eyes to borowe
Me lacks clerenes / of mine eyes tweyne
Beg I may / gleyne I can not certain
Therefore ye werck / I will plainly remytte
To folkis young / more passing clear of wit
Seche ye therefore / and in caas ye find
Such gleynors fressh as have some appare^ce
Of fair langage / yet take hem and unbind
And preue ye / what they be in existence
Colored in langage / sauerly in sentence
And doubt not my child / without deed
It will prouffite to see such thingis and red
Yet eft sons my child / let us resort
To thentente of yur first matere
Degressed somewhat / for we would report
And revive the laud of hem that were
Famous in our langage / these faders dear
Whose sowles in bliss / god eternel aua^nce
That lysten so our langage to enhaunce
Then^e lityl John / I counceyl you that ye
Take heed to the norture / that men use
New found / or ancient whether it be
So shall no man your curtoisye refuse
The guyse and custom / my child shall you excuse
Me^nys werkis / have often enterchan^ge
That now is norture / sometime had be stran^ge
Thingis whilom used / ben now leyd a side
And new feetis / daily ben contreuid
Mennys acts / can in no plyte abide
They be changeable and often meuid
Thingis sometime allowed / is now repreuid
And after this / shall things up arise
(...)t men set now / but at lytyl pryse
This mean I my child / yt ye shall haunte
The guyse of them / that do most manerly
But beware of vnthryft ruskyn galan^te
Counterfeter of uncunning curtoisye
His tacchis ben enfecte with vilonye
Vngyrte. vnblyssed. seruyng at table
Me seems him a seruan^t nothing able
Winter and somer to his souereyne
Capron hardy / no bonet list to auak
For every word / gyui^g his master tweyne
Auauntparler / in enery mannys tale
Absolon / with disheueld heeris small
Like to a prisoner of saint malowis
A sonny busshe / able to go to the galowis
O I pass norture fie fie for shame
I might have said he should go hawk and honte
For that should be a gentilmans game
To such disportes / gentil folks be wont
I said to far / my langage was to blonte
But yet sir gala^te wha^ ye shall bow or knele
He goth by compace round as does a whel
Braced so strayt / that he may not plye
But gaderith it / by manner of a wyndelas
And he ought wrenche a side / or a litil wrie
His geer stondeth then^e / m full parlous caas
His sho / his hose / doblet / point and laas
And if ought break / som^e tu^ges yt be bad
Will mock and say / a knave has broke a lad
Let galante go / I mean recheles ruskyn^
Take heed my child to such as be connyng
So shall ye best worship conquer and win
Enforce you in all your demenyng
To follow virtue / and fro folly declynyng
And wait well that ye love honest
Which is accrdyng unto humanyte
That is for you / to understand and know
That your array / be manerly reasonable
Not apysshe / on to mocken ne to mow
To nyce array / that is not commendable
Fetis new founden by fools vnprouffitable
That make ye world so plainly tra^sformate
That men semen almost enfemynate
Play not Jack malapert / that is to say
Beware of presumpco^n / beware of pryte
Take not ye first place my child by the way
Till other be set / right manerly abide
Presumptuous ben often set a side
And alleday aualyd / as men may see
And he is set up / that has humylyte
To connynd person^s regard ye take
Where ye be set / right in ententyf wise
Connyng folk / connyng men shall make
To their co^nyng ye shall make your surmise
And as they do / ye must your self deuyse
For this my child / is as the gospel true
Who will be co^nyng / he must ye co^nyng sewe
And one thing / I warn you specially
To womanhede / take awe alweye
And them to serve / look ye have an eye
And their com^andementis that ye obey
Pleasant words I auyse you to them seye
And in all wise / do ye your diligence
To do them pleasure / and reverence
And at this time this tretye shall suffice
Dispose you / to keep it in your mind
The doctrine which for you I deuyse
And doubts not / full well ye shall it find
To your honor / enrolle it up and bind
Right in your breast / and at your riper age
I shall write to you / hereof the surplusage
Go lytyl John / and who does you appose
Sayng your quayer / keep non accordance
Tell him as yet / neither in ryme ne prose
Ye ben expert / pray him of suffran^ce
Children must be / of chyldly gouernan^ce
And also they must entretyd be
With esy thing / and not with subtylte
Go lytil quayer / submytte you every where
Under correcto^n of benyuolence
And where envy is / look ye come not there
For any thing / keep your tretye thens
Envy is full of froward reprehens
And how to hurt / lies ever in a wait
Keep your quayer / that it be not there bayte
Explicit the book of curtesye.
