A Spiritual Song: containing an Historical Discourse from the infancy of
the world, until this present time: Setting down the treacherous practices of
the wicked, against the children of God: Decribing also the marks and
overthrow of Antichrist, with a thanksgiving to God for the preservation of
her Majesty, and of his Church.

Drawn out of the holy Scriptures, By Roger Cotton.

Psalm. 37.12. The wicked practices against the just, and gnasheth his teeth
against him.

Psalm. 37.13. But the Lord shall laugh him to scorn, for he sees that his day
is coming.

Psalm. 37.33. The wicked have drawn their sword, and have bent their bows to
cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.

Psalm. 37. But their sword shall enter into their own hearts, and their bows
shall be broken.

To the right worshypfull Sir Francis Drake Knight: Roger Cotton, wishes
continuance of health, with prosperous estate and felicity.
THe happy estate of the present, with the constant hope of further
prosperity (Right worshipful) by the glorious conquest of the heavenly army
of holy ones, and the virtuous zeal that you have, always had to defend Gods
truth, her Majesty's right, and Countries tranquillity, has imboldened me
(being a poor brother of the Worshypfull society of Drapers, whereinto you
were lately incorporated) to present unto you an Historical discourse and
short thanks giving, which I have rudely, but truly, and according to the
story, collected out of the holy Scriptures, declaring therein the extreme
rankour of the wicked against the godly, throughout all ages, with the just
judgments of God, duly rewarding their impieties; and also a description of
the marks of that Tirannicall Sea of Antichrist, the sworn enemy to the
gracious Gospel of eternal salvation, hereby hoping to encourage all such as
would avoid the heavy burden of that Egyptiecal yoke, the captivity of that
mystical Babell, and the persecution of Gog and Magog, to study the holy word
of God, which is the sword of the spirit; and to take unto them the whole
armor thereof, whereby they may be able to resist all the assaults of the
evil one, with all his soldiers, and may also have a full hope in the Lord,
that in the end they shall have a victorious conquest, as now we have, and so
learn with Martyrs, Apostles, and holy Prophets, to rejoice and sing Hosanna
and Haleluiah for the wound of that seven headed Oragon, and dyly to pray for
the overthrow of his whole rage: so shall their naked sores be covered and
healed with the leaves of that florishyng Tree of everlasting life, which
grows by the Crystal streams of that pure River, running through the City
of God, the celestial Jerusalem. This if your Worship shall accept, being the
first fruits of my small pains, not regarding the barbarousnes of my phrase
and verse, being no Scholar, but the zealous affection of my heart, to the love
of your godly care, for the upholding of Gods Religion. I shall (having so
skillful a Pilote to stir my stern, and so worthy a Captain to encounter
the enemy) be imbouldned hereafter to wade into deeper discourses (as God
shall bless, and time permit) to gratify your worthiness withal: Until
which time, I humbly commend your self, and your most virtuous proceedinges,
to the gracious government of the puissant Jehovah, the victorious King of
eternal glory.

Your worships to command, R. C.

To the Reader.
IT has been an usual thing, gentle Reader, throughout the whole Scriptures,
for later ages, to make recital of former stories, both concerning the cruel
rage of the wicked against the Church of God, and also the tender care the Lord
has had for the defense and delivery of his: and upon present experience of
the same, have assembled themselves together, not only to show forth Gods
glory by songs of praise and thanksgiving, but also to confess that as they
have heard, so have they seen: and therefore in the palaces of Syon was God
well known for a refuge, yea for a God most great, and therefore by them most
highly to be praised. Even so likewise (since all things that are written in
the holy Scriptures, are written for our learning, that we through patience and
comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope:) I have brought to your
remembrance (as breefely as I can) the cheifest stories therein contained for
this purpose, that when you have heard, you may also say, that you have seen,
his great severity in the late miraculous destruction of his and our Romish
enemies, and his accustomed mercy in the deliverance and preservation of his
children, and so by that means be stirred up to give all thanks and praise
unto God, and to have your hearts firmly stayed upon him, who is a wall and
strong defense to Syon his Beloved, and who continually sits upon a throne,
having a Rainebow round about, to assure us of his favor to be continued,
against the waters which the old Dragon powers out by the Italian Synagoue of
Rome, wherefore seeing he is our defense against the troublesome waves of this
life, let us never cease to be talking of the noble acts which he has done,
and the great deliverance which he has showed from time to time: and so take
occasion to have our mouths filled with his praises continually: so shall God
have his glory, and I my whole desire: and thus I rest, praying for thy peace,
and wishing (for my brethrens sake) thy prosperity, O Jerusalem.

Yours in the Lord, R. C.

P. K. In commendation of this work.
IF Poets pens deserved praise,
Whose pains deserved well:
Much more the minds, the pens, the men,
Endued with heavenly skill.
Of love, of war, of Plants, of Birds,
Of Sheep and Shepherds toys:
Have Poets writ who lie in dust,
Bereft of heavenly joys.
Yet these we see through world their praise,
With echo does resound:
Much more is praise to Cotton due,
Who makes Gods word his ground.
G. W. in praise of this Book.
WIll men be taught, in whom to put their trust,
In time of troubles stird by tyrants pride:
Or will they learn to whom the godly must
Sing thankful Himnes, when happy days betide?
Lo here a Lantarne, that may give them light,
Both to rely, and to rejoice a right.
A. W. in commendations of this discourse.
LEt worldly wisdom stand a part, let policy give place:
To simple ones, to little babes, whose hearts are filde with grace.
Whose tongues declare his praise, to whom all praise belonges.
With ioyfulnes, with singing cheer, in Psalms and spiritual Songs.
And you that hitherto have hid, your Talents in the ground:
Come learn of him that has but one, Gods mercies to resound.
R. I. in commendation of this work.
YOu idle Drones, that fleece and cannot feed,
You speechles ones, that can not bark nor bay:
You Slowwoormes mates, that make so evil speed,
To spy the Fox, and drive the Wolf away,
This Book shall be your judge an other day.
Which sweetly does record:
The mercies of our Lord.
And lively paints the whoredom of that Beast,
Whose mark Gods Saints do faithfully detest.

Let them which haue^ been redeemed of the Lord, show how he has delivered
them from the hand of the oppressor. Psalm. 107.2.
NOw may we all of England say of truth: Psalm. 124.

As we have heard, Psalm. 48.8
so have we seen performd
In these our days most worthy to be learnd: Psa. 121. to the end and 125.2.

How that the Lord does still his Church defend
From cruel foes, Psa. 37.33
whom his to hurt pretend.
Let us therefore unto our minds now call, Psalm. 37.1 14.32.

The cruel rage that wicked men have had,
Against the Lords, as though they had been mad:
Them to devour as Lions spoil their pray,
Inuenting their oppression day by day.
As bloody Caine, Genesis 4.1.1 18. and 1.
the first of Serpents race,
That onset gave against the woman's seed,
For whose good works he wrought that wicked deed. John. 3.12 and Jude. 1

And as began, the combat still does hold,
That sons of life, even swallow quick they would.
As Lamech next, Gene. 4.23 24.
a bud of that vile root,
Who in his rage, all men would wound and kill,
As though he did the law of God fulfill:
Whose deeds to grace he could a Scripture cite,
Although true sense and meaning wrested quite.
Genesis 9.22.25.26.27.
Next him that Cham the son of Noe the just,
who soon reuiues the wounded seed of Cain,
and does as ill vncoueryng Fathers shame:
and so procures a curse most vehemently,
Upon himself and his posterity.
Genesis 10.8.9.10. and 11.3. to the end.
As he for one, that Nimrod hunter great,
who said, Come buyld a Tower fair and hie,
a stately one, whose top may reach the sky:
that we may get unto our selves a name,
and all may see we well deserve the same.
Genesis 11.
But this their rage the Lord did soon epsy,
and down he came their language to confound,
that one knew not what others did propound:
and City theirs he called Babylon,
which name does show, They found Confusion.
Genesis 21.9.10.11. and Gala. 4.22. to end.
And Ismael next, Aegiptian Hagars son,
who Isaac skoft, of Abram blessed seed,
so as it shows how Cham does still proceed,
Genesis 15.13.
to hate, as Cain, the brother working good,
four hundred years afflicting Isaacs blood.
Genesis 27.41 and 32.6. and Ebre. 12.16.
The like does he, that Esau most profane,
good Iaacobs blood unkindly seek to spill,
like rauenyng Wolf, which seely Lamb does kill:
John. 1.29. and 1. Cori. 10.4. and Job. 6.47.
and birthright sold for mess of pottage red,
despising Christ, the Lamb, the Rock, the Bread.
Chams race holds on, Exodus 1,9.10.11.16. and 5.4. to 10.
as Pharaoh hard of heart,
good Abrams seed most hardly to entreat,
with slavish toil, and burdens over great:
in brick and clay, and bondage very ill,
until at length their children he did kill.
From ye time that Ismael began, to the coming out of Egypt, which was 400.
yeores. Exo. 7.19. and 8.6.16.24 and 9.3.10.23. and 10.14 22. and 12.29.
And thus they were four hundred years too long,
afflicted sore by Chams Egyptian dogs:
but they were plagued with lice, with flies, with frogs,
with blood for blood, with blaines, with scabs with hail,
to show how small man can against God prevail.
Himself, Exodus 14.1. to end.
his host, his chariots and his horse,
inclosd with waves, were tombd in heaps of sand,
where Israel past from yoke of Egypt land:
their ryder fell, Exodus 15.20.21.
and Israel skapt away,
and Miriam sung such praise, as now we may.
The second part.
THen Amalec, Number. 14.45. and 24.20.
of nations who was first,
that war did make, Gods people to withstand,
whereby they might them keep from holy land:
But Moses prayed while Sun abode in sky, Exodus 17.8 to the end.

and Joshua fought until his foes did fly.
And God a curse upon that nation gave, Exo. 17.14 and Number. 24.20.

and vow did make their name for to root out,
because against his they showed themselves so stout: 1. Sam. 15.2.3

and in Record he caused it to be, Exo. 17.14.16.

that he would war with them continually.
Number. 22. and 23. and 24. chapters.
Then Balak he to Balam said, Come curse,
come curse Israel, detest him I thee pray,
Number. 23.7.
who frets my heart to see him bear such sway:
Number. 22.3.5
Then Balam said, a people blessed of God,
Number. 13.32.
feign would I curse, but that I fear his rod.
2. Pet. 2.15.16 and Jude. 11.
Yet greedy gain this Prophet false drew on,
who wages loved unrighteously to get,
although dum Ass against that would teach him wit:
Number. 22.23.
And Angels sword against him was out drawn,
Number. 31.8.
who spared then, yet in the end was slain.
Judge. 3.8.12. and 4.2. and 6.1. and 10.7.8. and 13.1.
When Judges ruld, six times full sore oppressed
were Gods elect, by Nations strong and stout,
some left in land, some others thereabout:
Aram, Moab, Canaan, and such like,
Madian, Ammon, Philistines, all did strike.
Judge. 3.9.10.
But Othinel, Ehud, Shamgar, even he,
Judge. 3.31.
with goad of Ox six hundred men did kill,
Iud. 3.15.17.21.22.
and Ehud lame, fat Eglons blood did spill:
These Judges three, their foes (so strong) did bend,
Judge. 4.16.
and Barac did from Chariot wheels defend.
Judge. 7.20 and 6.12.
God whet his sword, and valiant Gedion fought,
Iud. 7.16.21.
with pitcher, pots, and men but hundreds three,
Iud. 7.12.
yet foylde that host which numbered could not be:
Iud. 11 33.
Of Ammon towns did Ieptath twenty strike,
Judge. 15.15.
and with Ass iaw did Samson thousand smite.
And Deborah help, Judge. 4.9.
and Stars and Streams did strive,
gaynst Canan Kings, Iud. 5.21.
at ancient Kishon brook,
at Kishon streams God on his Saints did look:
And Iaels hand with Hammer smote the Nail, Iud. 4.21.22.23.24. and. 5.24. to
28.

whereby Israel gaynst Sisera did prevail.
Yet did these streams increase their strength again,
and others met, until great floods they were,
in David's time, as it may well appear:
Both foreign foes, 1. Sam. 26.8 to 21. and 2. Sam. 15.
and those at home in breast,
as Absalon and Saul, above the rest.
Who David sought, 1. Sam. 26.20
as one would do a Flea,
and still did hunt the Anointed of the Lord,
his soul to take as Hunter Partridge would: 1. Sam. 24.12 and 26.20.

Even so did he most cruelly persist,
to persecute in him both God and Christ.
Yet did he stand as Lion strong and stout, According to Genesis 49.8. to 13.

until he did his foes all subject bring,
and he through God, did reign alone as King:
For whom the Lord the Crown and Diadem kept,
aye to remain: 1. Sam. 15.28
but Saul's away he swept.
The third part.
Again in days of King Iehosaphat, 2. Croni. 20.1 the end. and Psalm. 83.1.
to the end.

the vile pretense of wicked men we see,
and forces great, like Mountains seemd to be:
That then had joined in league and constant band,
to cut off quite poor Israel from their land.
Psalm. 83.4.
And that no name of Nation they should have,
Psalm. 83.3.4.
as then those crafty councels had decreed,
but thought in heart to cut them off with speed:
Psa. 83.6. to.9
and were in band ten Nations well we know,
that then had joined to serve good Israel so.
2. Chro. 20.6. to 14. and Psalm. 83.9. to end.
But Israel prayed, and God for them did fight,
to him they called, and he their suit did hear,
2. Chro. 20.22
and causd their foes kill each with others spear:
2. Chro. 20.17
they standing still, salvation did behold,
2. Chro. 20.25
and three days were in gathering of their gold.
2. Chro. 20.26
Then gathered they to valley Berachath,
to bless the Lord, to bless and praise his name,
whose mercies last toward those that seek the same:
they sought in truth, they sought as did him please,
who stroke their foes, and to them gave great ease.
2. Kin. 18.13. to end, and 19. to end, and 2. Chro. 32.1. to 23.
In time again of Ezechias King,
how did that proud Saneherib by name,
the Lord and his with most vile speech blaspheme.
in bragging sort most vaynely to be told,
as though by force he might get what he would.
2. Kin. 19.23. and Esai. 37.24.25.
I will said he, to top of mountains go,
2. Kin. 18.34. and 2. Chr. 32.13.14.15. and Esa. 36.14.18 19.20.
to Libanon, and her fair Cedars cut,
my feet shall you as dust from ground lick up:
What is become of all the Gods about?
Be not deceau'd, for none can keep me out.
But God a Hook into his nose did thrust, 2. Kin. 19.28

and bridled rage of this blaspheming King,
that thus had rayld on God that was living: 2. King. 19.22.23.

who overthrew his Host all in one night,
though number great and stout in armor dight. 2. Kin. 19.35.

And afterward him self was slain with sword, 2. Kin. 19.3^.

by his two Sons, while worshypping he was
his own false Gods, they then brought it to pass:
who did full fast to mount Arrat retire,
having dryde up the floods that Jews did fear.
The fourth part.
Again in time twixt Daniel and our Lord, Dan. 2.37. to 41.

most grievously four kingdoms did annoy, Dan. 7.17.18

the Saints of God, who longed for their joy:
and for their King, Dan. 2.44. and 7.13.14.
by whom they should have rest,
and freed from those that had them sore oppressed.
Which kingdoms four in vision then were seen, Dan. 7.2.3.

four savage Beasts in fearful sort and wise,
in Daniels sight out of the Sea to rise: Dan. 7.17.18.

and should unto his people be as bad
as cruel Beasts, Dan. 7.15.28. and 10.2.3.16
for which cause he was sad.
Yet presently to comfort him, no doubt
he did behold the Auncientest to sit, Dan. 7.9. to 13. and 10.21.

in judgment seat, to give a sentence fit
against those Beasts, Dan. 7.11
who yet had skapt his ire,
which now he saw go to eternal fire.
^n. 2.34. Dan. 2.31.32
And saw how Christ that Stone should beat to dust,
an Image fair in carnal eyes so seen, Dan. 2.35. Read Luke. 2.^. to 8.
then was the Image fully beaten to dust by Christ the stone. Dan. 2.33.41.42.43.

and scatter it, as though it had never been:
Although so hard of metals four was made,
yet toes and feet some dust amongst them had.
Dan. 2.31.32
Which Image then the king of Babell saw,
in goodly sort, as having head of Gold:
Dan. 2.37. to 46.
Which is the world, as he it did behold:
Dan. 2.35.
Until the time that Christ the Stone should come,
which he saw base, yet dashed them every one.
Math. 2.1. to 19.
No sooner was this Stone cut out of Mount,
but Herod he of Esaus race profane,
sought far and near true Jacob to have slain:
and killed all within two years of age,
to find out Christ, against whom, he did rage.
According to Dan. 2.35.
And when this Stone a Mountain great was grown,
and all the earth with glory it had filde,
yet did his own not cease till they had kilde,
Even him that just, that Lamb most innocent,
According to psalm. 2. which was fulfilled in Pilate and Herod, Roman officers.
and Heathens rage together were all bent.
Math. 27.26.28.29.30.31.39.40.41. and Mark. 15.15.18.19.20.27.28.29. and Luke
22.64. and 23. to end, and John. 19. to end, and Math. 13.55.56, and Mark. 6.4.
and Luke 4.22.
To whip, to spit, to toss from post to post,
to smite, to wound, to rail most shamefully:
saying, they knew him poorly borne to be.
To scoff, to floute, to pierce both hands and feet.
To hang on tree with thieves they thought it meet.
Thus did they bruise the heel of woman's seed, According to Gene. 3.15.

of his the chief, that Michael, prince of all:
But he overcame and caused them to fall, Reave. 12.7. to 11.

and brake the head of Devil Serpent old:
and foylde the rest of his, do what they could.
And for this spite to Christ, our only head, Math. 23.35. and 1. These. 2.16.

a vehement curse upon Jews he has brought,
and Romans he has painted out for naught:
He painted has that seat of Antichrist, Reave. 17.9.

that who so marks of him they shall be blessed.
Yea blessed they are, that Revelation read, Revel. 1.3. and 22.7.

wherein he has most clear and plain laid down,
the marks to know that Antichrist of Rome:
yea blessed they be that of that Beast beware, Reave. 14.9 to 14 and 15.23. and
16.15.

but cursed is he that mark of Beast does bear.
The fifth part.
WHerefore we will a little more proceed,
and note the like, since time of Christ on earth,
much like unto the time before his birth:
wherein is showed in visions two the sum, Reave. 13.1.2.11.

of Satan's rage until the day of doom.
Then first S. John out of the Sea saw rise, Reave. 13, 1, 2.

a monstrous Beast, compounded of them four,
which Daniel had in wickedness yet more: Dan. 7.

Which Beast is meant, Called y^ Withholder. 2. These. 2.7.
of Roman Emperors that
with blood of Saints themselves filled full and fat.
According to 2. These. 2.7. and Reave. 13.3. and 17.8.
And when this Beast, which is the first, was slain,
the second rose out of the earth, in show
like to a Lamb, in holy wise we know:
Reave. 13.11. to end.
But mark the end, and you shall find he spoke,
Reave. 13.11.12
as Dragon did, whose full strength he did take.
Reu. 13.12.16.
And caused all, both great and small to bow,
Reu. 13.15.17
and that no man might buy, or sell, or live,
unless he did all worship to him give:
Reave. 13.16.
Or mark at least, in hand or forehead have,
Reu. 13.17.
or bear his name: if but his crown to shave.
Reave. 17.18.
This same is she, that strumpet whore of Rome,
Reave. 17.6.
imbrude with blood of holy Martirs eke,
and does the same continually yet seek:
Reave. 17.4.
And still her cup of filthiness does wring,
Reave. 18.3.
that Kings on earth to folly she may bring.
Reu. 16.13.14.
And by those foul and unclean sprites like frogs,
which from that seat unto the world are sent,
to gather them that are on their side bent:
Reave. 12.17.
Great wars to make against the holy seed,
Reave. 12.6.14
which woman sent to wilderness with speed.
Reu. 12.12.14
Where she a time, two times, and half a time,
is safely kept, from rage of Serpent there,
Reave. 12.15.
although his streams he casts every where:
Which in the end, great floods do come to be,
as we of late with our own eyes did see.
And were gathered into a place to fight, Reave. 16.16 to end.

that called is the Mount of Mageddon,
with like success as Siser at Kyshon: Judge. 4.1. to end, and 5.1. to end.

Where stars did fight, even stars from heaven sent,
and Iael did the Nail strike fast in tent.
Even so likewise did Storm and Tempest help,
and Virgins hand thereto did well apply,
this mighty Host and Navy to defy:
Who thought their strength invincible they said,
but she through God, of them was not afraid.
Though like they were for to devour us all, Eeuen as the enemies of the
Church in Psalm. 83. and Psalm. 124. and Psalm. 48.

and swallow quick, for ought that we could see,
such was their rage as we might well epsy:
And as the floods with mighty force do fall,
so did they think to bring our lives to thrall.
These Popysh streams most proud in roaring wise,
made sure account to ourwhelme us in the deep:
but praysd be God, that does us safely keep,
From bloody teeth, who said with cruel voice,
us like a pray to eat they would rejoice.
But even as Birds out of the Foulers grin,
escapt away, right so it fares with us:
Broke are their nets, and we are escaped thus.
God that made heaven and earth is our help then,
whose name has saved us from these bloody men.
The sixth part.
Psalm. 48.8, 9, 10.
WHerefore as we have heard, so have we seen,
that God is still an help to his at hand,
against the rage of Satan to withstand:
And by our Queen most worthy Prince of same,
has foyld his foes to their rebuke and shame.
Reave. 17.16, 17.
Yea God has put into her noble heart,
to hate that Beast, and flesh of his to eat,
Reave. 17.16.
and still to strive to make him desolate:
The which God grant she may still so hold on,
Reave. 18.1. to the end.
that we may more see fall of Babylon.
And that her Grace, Gods will may thus perform,
we pray thee Lord, that long her reign may be,
since on this day she chosen was by thee:
And Crown did give, as due to her by right,
because she was accepted in thy sight.
Therefore let us this day with voices ring,
and give all praise and thanks unto the Lord,
that has her given for to defend his word:
Against the rage of Pope that monstrous Beast,
whose strength we pray, she daily more may waste.
Reave. 19.1. to 8.
So will we all still Halleluiah sing,
and eke confess that God alone does reign,
Reave. 19.16.
a King of Kings, for ever to remain:
Wherefore rejoice, and praises sing with heart,
and never let them from our mouths depart:
Since he does fight that on White Horse does ride, Reave. 19.11.

our battles all most righteous just and true,
a glorious Lord, to whom all praise is due:
For he alone the victory has wone, Reave. 19.20.

and into hell his foes cast every one.
Rejoice therefore, Revel. 18.20. and 19.1. to 8.
and praises let us sing,
ye people all that mark of God do bear,
come lend your voice, Reave. 19.5.
all ye that do him fear:
Come sing the song of Moses, Reave. 15.3.
servant his,
and of the Lamb, that on mount Sion is. Reave. 15.3. and 14.1.

And let us say, Reave. 15.3.4.
Most great and marvelous
are all thy works Lord God that art living,
Most just and true are all thy ways, O King:
Who would not fear and glorify thy name,
O Lord of hosts, whose ways are still the same?
Thou sits on high above the Heaues all, Psalm. 8.1. and Ebre. 1.3.

and down do look, on servants poor of thine,
and blood of theirs reuengest in due time: Reave. 19.2.

Wherefore we praise thy name eternally,
for that revenge on whore of Rome we see. Reave. 18.20. and 19.2.

FINIS.
A description of old Rome, or mystical Babylon: and may be song as the 81.
Psalm.
Saint John has blasd, most clear and plain to see:
Revel. 17.9.
Thou Rome do stand on seven hills, what City old but thee?
Reave. 17.18.

Reave. 17.8.
Thou Rome, that was, and eke was not, yet now thou art again.
Reave. 17.11.

Reave. 17.11.
Thou Rome, to wrack destruction calls, thou must as rest have gone.

Reave. 13.14.15 and 17.8.
