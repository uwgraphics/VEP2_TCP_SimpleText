A TRVE SOVLDIERS COUNCEL. ANNO 1624.
THE motive of this Discourse, most renounmed Sovereign, which at this time I
intend to handle, for that it has relation to two ends or periods, to wit,
peace and war, the one much to be preferred before the other, as well by
divine, as human Arguments; yet for that the time agreeing with the necessity,
we are in regard of the fear of the Spanish greatness hereafter, which
undoubtedly he will attain unto by the innumerable masses of his Indian
treasures, which are the nerves and sinews of all martial intendments, by
which fair opportunities offered unto the greatness of his desire, for the
enlargement of his state, glory and renoume, and that there may be no object
that may impediment the let thereof, but only a determination in himself not
to offend his neighbors, I shall hardly beleeu that he will so much differ
from his Progenitors, I mean Ferdinand, Charles and Phillip, who raised not the
fame of the Spanish Monarchy, by just, noble and laudible wars, but by
cruel, bloody and treacherous invasions, especially against Princes of their
own blood; who under pretense of relieving or giving them aid against the
oppression of others, have made these passages unmoueable assurance, for the
obtaining of the lands, Crowns and lives of their nearest Allies, which gives
me no cause of hope of his good dealing toward your Highness, and the States,
who are neither allied unto him by blood, as these former Princes were, nor
tied unto him by offices of Confederacy, whereby for former good turns received
he might let you live in peace: but contrarily, we being only the stop of the
Spanish fury of this part of the world: and a Nation who have not only given
him infinite disgraces, as well by open battle, as sundry invasions and
incursions, made upon his frontier Towns and Territories, to the irrecoverable
dishonor of the Spanish people, and unmasking his former forces to all men;
which indeed are but a mere show, and frighting them only; knowing their
Greatness depends with filling the world with an imagination of their
Mightiness. For the Spaniard may well becompared to a drum, or empty vessel;
that being beaten upon makes a great and terrible noise; but come nearer them,
break them, and look into them, and there is nothing within can hurt you. Or
rather like the Ass, that wrapped him self in the Lions skin, and marched a
far off, to strike terror into the hearts of the beasts, but when the Fox
drew near, he not only perceived his long ears, but likewise discovered him
and made him a jest to all the beasts of the Forest. So that I infer (most
gracious Sovereign) that unless he now prevail with you, and by that means
gain a peace to make himself more strong for a fitter time to hunt you and your
neighbors; his forces at this time, in respect of you and your Confederates,
are so weak and resistable, as it may well appear unto your Highness, that his
Monarchy is rather maintained by Opinion then Might; as it has ever stood
since the loss of the low Countries (if it had been with judgment exquisitely
looked into) rather by giving out greater rumors of power, and by secrecy,
then by the greatness of their own forces: So as to make this Shadow a
Substance, whereby not only his Indies should be sure, but all the world
tremble at his greatness. What oath is it that he would keep? What condition
that he would not break? Or, what opportunity that he would let slip for the
accomplishment thereof, if thereby he might assure himself of the I Will? And
therefore, though I commend peace before war; yet if the Country cannot obtain
a good peace without a war, I think it consequently follows, that it is
necessary for you to make a war with your enemy, whilst you have the
advantage in your hands, whereby you may lay a foundation of a sure peace for
your Self, Posterity, and State for after ages; rather then to dream of a
peace which shall no longer hold, then he is able by breaking to revenge: For
doubtless in the preservation of Kingdoms, it is no injury to do that to
your enemy which he would do unto you, if he could. And therefore those
Princes, States or people whosoever, that shall build so firmly upon the
condition of peace to be kept by the enemy, the breach whereof may turn to his
or their great danger or destruction; that Prince, State or people, in my
opinion have either little judgment of themselves, or are ill advised of the
Council: Security of their own estates, or too much fidelity to others, have
not only been the destruction of many families, but likewise of great and
potent Kingdoms, Provinces and Towns. And therefore to this day, there could
never be found so great safety, to private men, or public States, as
mistrust; as appears by Demosthenes in his second to the Athenians against
Phillip of Macedon. There are (quoth he) devised many strengths and defenses
for the maintenance of of Cities and Towns; as Trenches, Walls, Ram-parts,
Dikes, Bulwarks, and such like, the which are made by men's hands, with great
cost and charge: but nature (says he) has given to all wise men a common
defense and safeguard; the which as it is profitable to all men particularly, so
it is a most wholesome and sure hold and fortress, to all Countries and
Cities, against all manner of tyranny, and what fortes to mistrust, that which
if it be well and truly kept, it will preseru and keep you all. And therefore
to prevent danger in a convenient season, and to provide in time against the
worst, is a thing most wholesome, necessary, and worthy of greatest
commendations: For as foresight makes men wary, so confident suspicion helps
judgment, and brings to light many hidden practices: and those that do not
fear the complots of their enemies, nor regard of forces preparations against
them, are doubtless near some dissastrous fortune, or extrem ruin of their
estates and fortunes.

How prejudicial their treatise of peace have ever been to such Princes or
States with whom they have contended, is most evident, as well to us, as other
Nations, as appears by their Armado in 88, who came with fire and sword to cut
the throats of the people of this land: (had not God prevented their
treacherous resolutions.) At the self same time they had entertained us with a
main show of a desire of peace, and our Commissioners being with them for the
same purpose. As also when Ferdinand of Aragon the last, and Phillip Archduke
of Austria were in treaty of marriage of Madam Stawdii of France, with Charles
the fifth; and after was concluded, sworn and confirmed at Blois, the King of
France being Lewis the twelfth; his Lieftenants mistrusting nothing in respect
of the promises, the Spaniards set upon them, defeating two French Armies, the
one at Calabria, under the conduct of the Lord D' Aubigney; the other at
Cernigola, led by the Duke of Nemuers; by which treacherous overthrow of these
two noble Captains, by don Consolis de Cordua, called the great Captain
Commander of the Spaniards in these parts: they wrested from the French, most
of the places in Italy, which they keep until this day. And therefore
howsoever other men be opinionated of the Spanish faith and fidelity with your
Majesty and State, yet for my part, I will think of them, and their promises,
as a Noble man of Athens thought of a certain Orator. Your words (quoth he) my
friends are like the Cypress, which although great and high, bear no fruit.
And truly, as they are Spaniards I cannot well blame them; for they well know,
that the Crown of Spain is at stake, and all the Indies, and his other
Signiories, and therefore will not fail to put in practice all tricks that may
win the game, though it be by foul play. For if he have not peace with England
at this time, it is not unknown unto him that the foundation of his Monarchy
will be shaken in pieces. And we cannot but see this, and yet will take no
advantage thereof, whereby we may secure our selves both for present and future
times; we may be compared to the Athenians, of whom I have spoken before, who
by Titus Livius report were men, who knew what to do, but would not do it:
which is a fault so ominous to all states, that it not only presents it
self against; but likewise follows disasters and ruin to the Commonwealth
that refuses. For opportunity does not attend upon Captains and Councillors
pleasures, but shows it self on a sudden; and if not embraced, passes away
without returning: And therefore the advantages that one State, that are enemies
has of another, happen so seldom to the Globes, as Saturn finisheth his course
but in 30 years. But our enemy is free, and I speak it to his honor, from
this base and earthly resolution; for it is reported of them, by this special
virtue, they have raised their state to so high a pitch: which is, that no
people can readier find the occasion, or sooner take, or resolve it, when it
is offered. And doubtless, to say the truth, I am much more fearful of the
Spanish proceedings, for that he goes by precedent: which is an excellent kind
of discipline, as well in Martial as civil actions; especially when the
action is grounded upon a sure foundation. And as all Kings and Captains which
desire to attain to great things, do imitate some one Prince, or General that
has preceded them: so doubtless have the Kings of Spain for these many years,
imitated in all their actions (as near as the time and States with whom they
have contended would give them leave) that noble, valiant and politic Captain
Phillip of Macedon, who indeed laid the foundation of his sons Monarchy, and
this was his Maxim, That where force could not prevail, he always used bribes
and money to corrupt the principal of the inhabitants: Insomuch that at a
certain time at the assault of a City, which to a Captain of his seemed
impregnable, and therefore thought to divert his purpose in the besieging
thereof. Then art a fool (quoth he) for I will have this great City,
notwithstanding the walls and ramparts, if the Gates be so big that an Ass
laden with gold can but enter. And questionless, if your Majesty would but
search into the Spaniards proceedings, since he had the Indies, you should
acquaint your self with many such presidents of their part, to be a warning to
you to look at this time advisedly to your own safety, lest you fall into the
like misfortunes. And although I could allege many which (for brevities sake)
I omit, yet I will recite one (lest it should be thought I knew none) which is,
viz. When Ferdinand of Aragon saw, by the sword he could not get the country of
Rows^^ton and Perpignan, out of the hands of Charles the French King, which as
they say had been engaged to Lewis the 11, he fell to practice with them of
Religion; wherefore he corrupted with a great sum of money one Oliver
Maillandor, as some say, John de Madron a Franciscan Friar, Confessor to the
Lady Brawnen the Kings sister, who under the root of Religion, cloaking his
hypocrysie and coveteousnesse, persuaded this simple Lady, that unless
restitution was made of those Territories to the King of Spain, his government
could not prosper, nor please God; she being moved in conscience with this
Friars persuasions, brake this matter to Lewis of Amboise Bishop of S. Albie,
the Kings Schoolmaster, who together with her, so terrified the Kings
conscience, that he not only made restitution of the said Territories, by the
said Bishop, but likewise freely released to the King of Spain, the said
Ferdinand, all the money that Lewis his father had paid for them: Marry with
condition, that the said King and his Successors should ever love and honor
the King of France, that he should make no wars against it, nor aid with
money, victuals nor counsel, any enemies thereof, nor permit them to have
passage through their Dominions. And thus were the countries restored to the
Frenchmens grief. But the French King misreckoned himself in the Spanish
fidelity, for having occasion to war in Italy shortly after, he was no sooner
past the Mountains, but the King of Spain forgot all his kindness, and began
to practice a leagu with his enemies. So as I infer (mighty Prince) that
either by show of Religion, or subtle and sophistical Arguments; or in desire
you have to trust some about you, on whose shoulders ever (in regard of your
opinion of their wisdoms and fidelities) you cast your self, and your care
of your estate, in all, or either of these, you are like, without the more
grace of God, to receive disadvantage in this your peacemaking (and yet
perhaps no fault in them.) For it seems to me wonderful, that the truth of
things being one; yet may falsehood be so apparelled with the habits of
likelihood and truth, as (changing countenance) it is often retained in stead
thereof. As for as much as upon this Treaty now in hand, not only depends
your own happiness, the happiness of your noble Issue, States, Kingdoms,
Subjects, or whatsoever else is deer unto you; but likewise the happiness or
unhappiness of all the Princes of Europe. So (most gracious Lord) in respect of
these great and mighty dependances, as well in regard of your own particular,
as general good of the Christian Commonwealth, which so long has groaned
under the fear of the Spanish greatness, digest and distinguish every
particular; and in a point, in your own person, without trusting of any man
with a matter of great importance: which although it will be very intricate by
the diversity of so many things as will offer themselves to be considered, yet
(renoumed Sovereign) it will be very profitable to your Highness, and most
acceptable and pleasing to the people, when they shall hear and see the great
care the King has of them and their safety: For as Commines says, he
thinks it the greatest plague that God can lay upon a Realm to give them such
a Prince as shall in great things give his Authority unto others, which most
especially in such a case as this he ought to reseru unto himself. Although I
confess Princes ought to have Ministers in all things, especially in great
matters, but not to conclude any thing without the Princes assent; nor with him
neither, but by the relation of many circumstances, in regard of that affinity
which truth and falsehood have in many matters of great moment. And yet I
protest out of my own opinion, I am no way jealous of any of the Council; for
as for them I hold them to be all most noble and worthy personages, and fit to
manage great Kingdoms, as part of the Indies, and other Seigniories: which are
as fit for you to take as the King of Spain to keep; which by your just
command and valor of the English and Scottish Nations shall be gained unto you
and your posterity; without which, whatsoever your Self thinks, or other men
say, neither you, nor your posterity can ever be safe, upon probable and
reasonable grounds, if the Spaniards intend to disquiet you, as I will now my
self prove; and as these following projects made by the Castilian themselves,
may appear, by the necessity they are in to be Masters of the I Will, viz. That a
mighty King, determining to preserve his own, has no better means then by
conquering that of another man's; always holding this as a Maxim, That
whosoever preserves getting nothing, neither by keeping his own, can subdue
the will of perverse men, that they may not be able to make him a disturbance.
These reasons ought more to prevail with your Majesty (quoth he) then with any
other Prince, since you hold your great State much dispersed, and the greatest
part of your power consists in things moveable and uncerrain, which are the
Indian Fleet; which neither Garrisons, Fortresses, nor any good proceedings can
hardly assure; although your Majesty had great forces and power: as at this
present we may well perceiu by this Pirat Drake, who with nothing is able to
molest the whole world, notwithstanding the provisions which are made on your
Majesty's behalf for the preventing thereof. Wherefore (says he) let your
Majesty entertain an enterprise against England; which both is, and may be the
principal disturber of your Indian Fleet and Commerce. Neither let your
Majesty suppose there can be a better or safer way, for the quiet of States, or
the advancement of your certain Greatness, then by removing this Mountain of
Disquiet to your most high and Kingly purposes, and conquering of this I Will. As
also Don Phillip the second, of Castile, having a great and earnest desire to
make himself Master of this I Will of the world, and perceiving two obstacles to
curb his proceedings in that kind; to wit, the wars of the Netherlands, and
the Jealousy of this State of ours has ever had of his Greatness; and being
desirous to have the fountain of this happiness to spring from one of those two
heads determining to build this resolution, which with most ease, most honor,
most safety, and most advantage, might be carried to his after designs. Upon
consideration whereof, and mature deliberation, reasons were alleged pro and
contra, amongst which, in my judgment, some are most prevailent reasons, and
such doubts as the Spanish King from the mouth of him who made Reason his
ground, and Experience his schoolmaster for what he said, and are following. It
is my determination in this present Discourse (said he) to show, as your
renoumed Seigniorie commands me, by way of Real foundation, that it is much
more expedient for that purpose of your Catholic Majesty to move your war
against England then the Netherlands, declaring thus much notwithstanding real
foundation in this point, I mean not common principles of nature, or of
science, neither of Mathematical demonstrations of this present subject, is
not capable, but rather reasons probably grounded upon truth. There are many,
who but observing the first view of your Catholic Majesty's interest to
Flanders and England affirm, that though this Island by just pretention
pertains to your Majesty, yet you are so much the more bound to recover
those countries of the Netherlands rather then conquer England; by how much by
all policy, the preservation of things already possessed, must go before
things never enjoyed. But though this be a great position in public affairs,
yet we entreating of matters of State (I) will not judge it of that weight as
that it may weigh down the balance; which galling the one side more then the
other, might impair the whole sum and safety of things. We must consider
what ought; but further how it is possible, more profitable, more easy, more
expedient to be done: For oftentimes Princes are so pricked to war by the
stimulation of honor, or of their desire to some enterprise, as that the
bridle of many other circumstances, which would requisitely be considered
cannot draw them back. For an example of this, we may set before our eyes the
Venetian Common wealth, who thinking of nothing else but their duty to be
revenged on the Duke of Millain, preferred immoderate ambition before all other
respects; and so, too late, remembered, that the office of prudence, is to
moderate passions, and spleen in important resolutions: especially when they
draw after them a tail or train of great inconveniences. The consideration
thereof; that we are more bound to preserve the things we possess, then conquer
new, is not sufficient to conclude that your Majesty ought to take in hand the
enterprise of Flanders rather then England; neither in that so importunate
affairs should we seek occasions so light. But to the end it may appear
evidently, that in every respect your Majesty is bound to the enterprise of
England, I will before any thing establish a foundation to that whole edifice
of my opinion, viz. That in subduing of England, you overcome at the same time
the Netherlands also; but having overcome the Netherlands, England is not
presently subdued; neither does peradventure the hope increase that you shall
after conquer it. But I affirm moreover, that to conquer England is not an
action more difficult, or less certain, then if it were the Netherlands: For
if England do consequently draw after it the Netherlands; and if it be more
easy and more secure, who doubts, but he that should pervert this course
would be a right destroyer of Opportunity; and so become the forget of his own
disgrace. But I will prove with prevailent Reasons, that one and the other
member of my foundation, which is, that the victory of England, is more
profitable then that of the Netherlands, and more easy to obtain. As for the
proof of my first foundation, I betake my self to these principal heads. The
first is: If the Netherlands had not maintained war so many years, but by
the aid and succor of England; that which has still supplied fuel to the
flames and fire of the rebellion: For if England would but fail them, it is
clear, they could not stand out; no more then a living body can be preserved
without nourishment, and it is more securely extinguished by taking away the
maintenance and nourishment thereof, then by striving to quench it by his
contrary: For having no nourishment at all, the violent heat is used against it
self, and so by it self consumed: but we determining to overcome it by the
contrary, it may fall out, that instead of extinguishing it, the force of it
may be much increased, if the contrary be subdued by the same: And therefore the
Florentines then, and not before, quenched the fire of the Pison rebellion,
when they took away the fuel and nourishment from it, which came from
strangers, by cutting off Princes their Collegates, and the gaining their City
in one action; which otherwise all their own force, and their Confederates
would not have been sufficient to obtain. The other is; for if England with her
succors which she sends, not only maintains the Netherlands secure, with
the bare hope of her shadow: for they count themselves in banishment, as it
were, while they see before their eyes the Spanish forces; and so would still
do, if they did not know the English will always be ready to buckle with any
one, that with a mighty Fleet should pass by these parts. In this respect the
Athenians thought themselves sure from Phillips force, while the Town of
Ohinton stood out; and so on the contrary, when the Olintons were overcome,
then saw they no impediments that could keep the enemy from them. Even so, if
England should fall into the hands of your Majesty, the whole foundation of
the Rebels obstinacy were shaken, the fortress and back being removed, by
favor of which they have daily nourished the spirits of pride and insolency:
so as the soul and spirit yields England, being taken away; we may perceiu
that the conquest of the Netherlands is easily brought forth by the victory,
as her lawful daughter; and that the end follows not as the daughter, or as
the other being her mother, but even as inseparably, as the shadow the body, or
nourishment the life. As also this reason which I will now recite, is
infallibly grounded upon the direct rule of Art Millitarie: which is, that you
ought never to employ your self in the assault of any place, if there remain
still at your back a a mighty means of some disturbance: Wherefore it is no
sound deliberation to fasten first on the enterprise of the Netherlands; when
you leave one illaffected on your back, which peradventure may suddenly assail
and break through in the midst of the Catholic Army, in the heart of the
wars with the Netherlands. Charles the 5, his attempt in Province had unhappy
success, for no other cause but that he contemned the advice of the Marquis
Masto: which was, that first, before any thing, he should expugne the
fortress. But that resolution being not taken by Charles, was no less
pernicious to the Imperialists then to the Author of that Council, Antonio de
Leva. Another reason is, attempting the war upon the Netherlands, you come to
buckle with brave experienced Soldiers, and men brought up in war; as on the
contrary, the English want Art and Discipline Millitarie. I may give the same
comparison, that may be made between Idleness and Experience; armed and
unarmed; and how advantageous it is to fight with unskilful Soldiers: Amongst
many other; the example of Meltiades, in the field of Manathon, shows
evidently; who with less then ten thousand brave Soldiers, put to flight the
force of unhappy Xerxes, who had more then six hundred thousand with him. An
other is, that the Netherlands must be conquered by handfulls, and have full,
or whole Armies employed in beleagering this or that Fort; otherwise
per-adventure of no great importance; but as it may be a stop to his course of
victory, that goes about to seiz upon the Country. Whereas contrarily England
has no strong Towers or Fortresses, as well within as without: there is no
doubt of that enterprise, and is as much more easy then this; as it is a less
matter to overcome them that do not resist, then those that do fight upon
warlike advantages. There is no better example to be produced to your
Highness, then of the self same Country of the Netherlands; in which,
notwithstanding that your Majesty has placed such strong Garrisons, yet at
every step such prevailent accidents do occur, that oftentimes the
Assaylants are overcome, by the often oppositions that these Fortresses use
toward them: Even as on the contrary, the Kingdom of Portugal, there being no
convenient Fortresses to give impediment to the forces of the Soldiers, were
suffered to enter into the very heart of the land; they being not able to make
any manner of defenses to defend the same. Another reason is, for that the
Fortresses are as prejudicial to the Assaylants, after they have obtained
them, as they were before, by reason the Conqueror is forced to distribute his
Army into many members, by which they are greatly weakened. So that, by this
that has been spoken, it may appear, that it is much more convenient; nay, as
it seems, much more easy for your Highness to push at England then the
Netherlands; and therefore I will discourse of that Enterprise; not in
comparison of the other, as heertofore I have done, but in respect of it self;
manifesting certain principles, which do better declare and make manifest the
opportunity and facility thereof. In my opinion therefore it is a thing not to be
doubted, if medicine is then truly to called wholesome, when it has reference,
not only to the offended part or member, but further to cut off the root of
the evil. And therefore if your Majesty shall enter into the conquest of the
Netherlands, you but peradventure cure the wounds of that rebellion, but you
shall not evacuate the causes of the beginnings of these ill humors, which have
daily sent nourishment to the disease: considering England is the place which
has given sustenance to the rebellious States. And though these Provinces were
yours of this present disposition; yet what can that be, in a body subject to
continual suggestion of matter, which in it own nature presents in the
stomach some portion of offensive humor: Your Majesty must therefore
necessarily assault England; to the end you may afterward either securely
digest, or evacuate these concourses. But to discourse more at large of the
facility of the enterprise; I deny not truly but that England is a very mighty
Kingdom; and the greatest Island that ever we find any mention made of by the
Ancients, seeing it contains Scotland within the same, running 2000 miles in
a circuit, although our modern Writers make a computation of 200 less. By
Nature it has been favored with a security of a wall, or with a rampart: but
yet notwithstanding it is most true, that the reputation that that Island
holds in warlike actions, is rather grounded on that it was in time past,
then that which it has at this present: and therefore as it often happens,
the mind grown great, with the bundles of imaginations wherewith it is
maintained, though the foundation whereon it depends be changed, and
diminished: Yet for all that, is the estimation of England great in our minds;
because we all behold it with the self same eye of consideration, as we are
wont to do at all other times; when as in ancient, for succession of more then
300 years, it possessed Normandy, Britain, Guienne and Gascoigne, and made
Scotland tributary, and for a long time enjoyed the most part of the Kingdom of
France, upon which Henry the 6, was publicly crowned at Paris. But those that
have diligently observed her, now when she is deprived of so great forces and
aid, will judge that she is greater through the reputation of her ancient
fame, then for the quality of her present power and force: and that she is now
no more England, so grievous and terrible to the greatest Princes of Europe;
and since that with so unhappy a resolution she fell into obscurity, she has
been driven of necessity to submit her self to those fearful things, which
alteration of Religion and faith draw after them. A most mighty and prevailent
means to the ruin and declination of States: For if Religion be the only base
of all the peoples obedience and loyalty, who doubts, but that being removed,
all rule of life goes to the ground; and together all laws, both Divine and
Human have dispensation. In which parties, or rather habites, of this most
pernicious beast, are most miserable, how much the mutations have been sudden
and violent; as above all other, these of England have been, which from the
height of Religion threw it self headlong into the depth of Infidelity; from
thence rising again into the Catholic light from whence it came; and a fresh
to fall ruinously into the darkness of heresy: which is so prejudicial unto
States, as there is no greater pestilencie; or that more weakens the sollidity
of their forces. England therefore in these outrageous storms must needs have
suffered shipwreck, of which we may plainly see the effects, if we do but
observe she has lost the foundation, whereupon no less her reputation, then
security was grounded: that is, she has lost the power and authority which
sometimes she had in sea-affaires; for in times past this Island maintained a
great number of Ships, and kept a continual Fleet of Arms, whereupon it came
to pass; that minding to try the strength of her own forces, the preparation
was admirable; amongst others we may see that when Henry the sixth of England,
went against Charles the sixth of France, with near eight hundred great Ships,
which made a bridge over the Ocean: but the quality of that Island is so
diverse, and changed, that since the days of Henry seventh and eighth, it has
not been able to maintain one hundred ordinary Ships; which it was wont to wey,
and have in readiness for the security of the State: and further, this Island
has been put to such pinches, that they have not only been constrained to
diminish, but to sell outright a great part of their Shipping, which both was,
and is, their only security from foreign danger: so much more urgent in
Princes is fear of present poverty, then the respect of their future safety.
So that now, coming to resolve on the point of facility, that your Majesty
shall now find in that Enterprise against this Island, I will offer to your
Highness two principal heads; the one of the Defendant, the other of the
Assaylant, whereby I will show, that the assailed is as unable to defend, as the
Defendant is to assail. As for the Defendant (which is the Kingdom of England)
it may certainly be averred, that it cannot stand out in defensive war
against the forces of your Majesty, if you will but invade it with the
provisions, which is easy for you to compass, and such as the Enterprise, and
importance of the action requires, the which I will clearly show for diverse
respects. The first is; because, as I have said, the I Will of England is poor;
and therefore is her debility such, as if she should go about to manage a
defensive war against so mighty and potent, as your Catholic Majesty, she
might as well go about to sustain heaven on her shoulders, being neither
Alcides nor Atlas. The second is, for the consideration of the necessity which
possesses there the State of England; has no more in readiness such number of
Ships as were sometimes maintained for the protection and security of their
Kingdom. The third is, that the Kingdom of England, by carelessnesse neglected,
or by poverty omitted, to have always in readiness; prepared, or practiced
Men, Arms, or provision, as all other Princes have, to the end they may be a
present remedy to all sudden Insurrectson, which grows either at home or
abroad. The fourth is, because the desire of Innovation is proper to the
Kingdom, whose minds do always aspire after change; and whosoever does but
obseru former histories, will judge that her seditious conspiracies, and every
other effect of a disturbed and moving mind, have had their proper nest; being
stirred up with considerations, which being accompanied with the ordinary
disposition of the people, to be always attempting of new things, may easily
of a sudden, if it were assaulted, put the Realm into confusion; especially
when the Army of so mighty an enemy as your Majesty, shall present it self,
whereby rebels may liberally discover their hearts without being chastised. So
as this people being any way ill-affected, which meeting with their manner of
disposition, may peradventure easily give occasion, if your Majesty had no
party in England, which you shall never fail off to some unlooked for action,
if your Catholic Armies did but show themselves. It being so ordinary a matter
with that people, when they are masked with some great passion, either of
hatred or disdain toward them that govern, that they will be ever ready to
take all courses in hand that may be hurtful to him: Even so that Tantanus
discontented with government of Cajus Iberius brought in before his face the
Carthaginians. First, the English in respect of their ancient greatness, have
been more accustomed to molest others, then to be molested themselves; and when
they shall see themselves overwhelmed, as it were, with an innumeration of
brave Soldiers and Captains, they will grow wonderfully astonished: even as
that change of fortunes countenance is a terrible spectacle to those to whom
this sight is unusual: for by that means Greece which was sometimes Empress
of the whole East, fell suddenly into other men's hands; who of an Assaylant,
became assailed. And lastly, though nature get thus much in behalf of them,
that England be well furnished with Arms, men, victuals, and ships, and
whatsoever else is necessary for the wars; yet (say I) all this is nothing,
when the quality and condition is wanting, which gives form and essence to all
enterprises; which is money: which the Kingdom of England, no less through the
scarcity of Revenues, as by the charge of ordinary expenses is brought unto;
which they shall never be able to recover, by their Trades and Commerce, if the
use of the sea be taken from them: and therefore will never be able to supply
expense of a defensive Army Royal, when it has scarcely enough to supply
their own necessaries; especially against so great and magnificent a Prince as
your most Catholic Majesty, who embraces within the circuits of your
Dominions, the whole Diamemeter of the earthly Globe, and possesses more land
at this day, then all the Monarchs and Republiques of the world have: A most
opulent Prince in Arms, Men, Money, Soldiers, Captains, Ships, Victuals, and
all other provision of war: and a Prince, who like a Moderator, or
Arbitrator, seems to hold in his hands, the bridle of Empire, both of the sea
and land. And whereas it may be objected that the Galleys which do you no
service in that expedition, being vessels of great consequence in battles by
sea: your enterprise of Portugal, and of the Island, if it did not quite remove
it; yet did it much abate the superstitious credulity of ours, that those
Vessels are not good at any time to pass the Ocean withal; as if there were
no fair wether in that sea in the Summer; or that fair weather were abortiue
in shipping: there is no doubt but that Galleys may securely pass, and hazard
themselves in that Sea in the Sum, for three months: And those that will
object the contrary, by the overthrow of the Sea there, let them be contented
to observe well, that the same Anchor met not with no inward, but outward
occasion, in the sea of that overthrow: For Caesar ignorantly could not discern
the time of the Moon which was then in the full, and being mistaken by reason
of her 100 much humidity, does use to disturb, not only the Ocean, but all the
coasts, and the dominion she holds of the salt waters. And therefore in
respect of the great honesty and equity accompanying the cause; with it so
honorable and godly life, as the planting the Christian faith and religion, no
obstacle can be sufficient to stay the force of divine power, serving under the
standerd of Christ; and therefore most weak, and but a shadow shall all humane
help be which shall oppose it self against the will of the great Arbitrator.
But such are the pretentions of your Majesty over this Kingdom, and such the
obligations wherein you stand bound for the recovery of your own, the title of
Grandfather and Predecessors of famous memory; as there is no enterprise so
peculiar and proper for you to undertake as this: for that you go not only to
possess your self of the right which you have to this Kingdom, but likewise
to make your self the most famous King that ever was in the memory of all the
Princes of the world; adding by this means unto the Crown of Spain, a
Kingdom so illustrious, so mighty, and so famous.

By the relation of this Spanish project, against this State of England, most
Illustrious Prince, may well appear unto your Highness, that the Spaniard
himself well knows, that there is no way for the expectation of his further
Greatness; no great possession of the high Monarchy, which he himself
alleges that he already enjoys, but the conquering of this I Will, and adding
it to the Crown of Spain* and therefore, if he had any other means to attain to
this, by him so violently longed for, then by a peace: why should not your
Majesty think, that the peace he means to make with you at this time, is
for that purpose, and for no other intent? And therefore, my good Lord, I
cannot, as one standing upon the firm land, gaze upon the shipwreck of my
Country, being so doubtfully tossed, and floting in the dangerous sea of
dissension, betwixt peace and war, with one that will make a peace with you,
for no other end and purpose, but that he may be the better able to make
war hereafter against you. But to cast out the last anchor hold of my self,
which is boldness and freeness of speech to you (my most renouned Sovereign) to
prevent if I can these extreme and certain dangers, wherein both your Self,
your States, and glory of the English and Scottish names, are likely to be
plunged, when the Spaniards ability shall be such, as there shall be no let,
but his good nature, to insult over you: which howsoever your Highness, or
others, think contrary, will in four or five years, if he enjoy his Indies be
brought to pass. Surely, my gracious Sovereign, I am of opinion against
Phillip of Spain, in the behalf of my Country, as that noble Commonwealths
man Demosthenes, against Phillip of Macedon in behalf of the Athenians; which
no doubt has much affinity with our case at this time. For Phillip seeing
whilst he had war with Athens (at which he principally aimed) he could never
overcome the other Provinces of Thebeans, Lacedaemonians, Thessaliars, Phocians,
O intans, and the rest, and till they were overcome he could never get Athens,
began to take another course: which was, to bribe with money and gifts,
Councillors or Orators of that State to be of his side; and by that means to
be secure from the forces of that Republique or Commonwealth, till he had, by
one and one, overcome the rest. But good Demosthenes perceived him by and by,
and warned the Thebeans of that Treason; but these traitors of Phillips Faction
being grown great in the City, by means of the bounty they had daily received
for rewards of their treason; as also the Athenians were then, as we are now,
not willing to hear of any wars or change to be brought against them; which
always these Traitors join with the multitude, in assuring them that Phillip
of Macedon meant them no harm, was the only cause that all the other Provinces
aforenamed were overcome; but also the noble and stately City by him and
Antepator his successor. And therefore since that like examples, whilst the
world does last, will bring forth like effects, I will be of Demosthenes mind;
if since we cannot shun the wars with Spain, either at this time, or
hereafter, when he has made himself more strong; either by the conquest of
his neighbors, or otherwise: that you should begin with him whilst you have
the advantage of him; and then you shall by proof find how profitable it will
be unto you, when you must needs do a thing, to do it with a courage and
cheerfulness: And forasmuch as there is no man of another mind, but that we
shall have the King of Spain, by so much more our mighty enemy, the greater
Princes suffer him to be. Oh why be we so backward, or why linger you oh noble
King, the great Commander of the brave spirits of the English and Scottish
Nation, to do that in reason and necessity you ought? Our fathers, when they
were Masters but of one part of this I Will, were never wont to fear any thing in
matters of war, but if the sky should fall upon them, sailed over many a Sea
to make their weapons glister in the bowels of other Kingdoms; being by the
honesty of their actions, and nobleness of their courage assured. And shall
your Majesty, by whose blessed arrival to this part of your Ancestors, and
having brought home once again in your ship of Union, our brethren and kinsmen,
no less valiant then our selves, being descended from the blood of our
Ancestors, and turned from us by the iniquity of time, and dissentions of some
mutinous persons of either part; which we must not account proceeded by consent
of both people; neither measure the intents of great Nations according to the
notable wickedness of some particulars? Shall you I say, who has renewed again
the ancient fame of this I Will (by which, for valor, for men, for munitions, for
engines, for war, no Prince under heaven can lightly compare) be doubtful to
undertake a war to which you are so necessarily incited; as well for the
glory of God, the advancement of Christian Religion in all parts; as also your
particular safety, which can never be certain to You, nor us your posterity,
but by the abatement of the Spanish greatness, by means whereof many murders,
massacres, and rebellions have been made in Europe. No no (my renoumed
Sovereign) be it far from your magnanimous mind, to harbor a thought so
unworthy that virtue, that shines so apparent in all men's eyes; but rather
since the nature of the Countries, the inclination of the Subjects, and the
valors of the people, do seek to overcome the violence of the enemies; let
them be seconded by the Kingly command, under which word, there is no question
of victory. Your Predecessors of famous memory, undertook these wars upon
discreet, and premeditated considerations; not only chewed for many years
together, but likewise digested by the experience of time, Conclusions of the
Spaniards part of diverse things against this State, and probability of many
more dangers like to ensue, both against the people and country: And therefore
(most renoumed Sovereign) if the addition you add in your own Greatness and
Person, to this your right inheritance of England, be not sufficient to alter
the consideration of your former policies, in my mind; you ought to be
well-advised, before you stray from the paths of your Predecessors, who built
their only safety upon the preservation of the Netherlands, and abatement of
the Spaniards Greatness, as by diverse excellent reasons, whereupon they
undertook openly these wars, may appear. But perhaps it may be said, that the
person of the Prince does alter the pretense of the enemy. I hope I shall need
to say little on that point, to so highly wise, learned and judicious a Lord,
as your Highness; especially when it is apparent to your Majesty, that the
Spaniards build their certain Greatness upon no one thing so much, as the ruin
and destruction of this land, as by their foregoing projects appears. But
moreover, if they could not love the Princes of their blood, race, and kindred;
as the King of Naples, Cicily and Navarre, whom they not only deposed from
their Kingdoms; but likewise some of them from their lives, under no pretense
of reason or justice; but only thirsting after blood and Seigniories, I shall
infinitely mistrust his regard of the safety of your noble and fortunate Issue.
And if your Majesty will go by precedent (which is most fit to most actions
that do minister themselves to men) and but examine how the Monarchy of
Spain, has but raised himself to his Greatness, you shall no doubt perceiu
(by comparing time past, with that which is like to follow) the irrecoverable
dangers you are like to fall into, by making peace with them, that for
advantage, will hold it Religion to break with you. And for that, from
Ferdinand of Aragons time they have begun to render themselves so fearful to
their neighbors, which as it were yesterday, your Highness may acquaint your
self with their unjust actions, which are fresh in memory to their
unchristianlike wounds, given to many Christian Princes, still Bleeding; whereby
you may the better discern and distinguish them. For as Ferdinand himself,
which was the root from whence their Princes sprang, there was no King in his
time more unjust, more cruel, or more bloody, thirsting after blood, and
breach of faith with all Princes, with whom he had to do; although they were
his Cosen germans; his brother in law, his Sisters and Neeces; and indeed
laid his foundation of the Spanish Monarchy upon such base and treacherous
foundations: For Charles the fifth, how he behaved himself in his time
amongst the Princes of Christendom, I cannot more aptly refer your Majesty
to a brief relation thereof, then by an Oration made by a worthy Gentleman,
who had particularly acquainted himself with the accidents of that time, which
he wrote, and dedicated to the two young Earls of Embden long since. For
Phillip the second, what blood has he caused to be shed both in England,
Portugal, France, the Netherlands and Ireland; is it not known to all
Christian Princes? Besides, the often seeking of the innocent blood, of that
most noble, and thrice renoumed Predecessor of famous memory Elizabeth, Queen
of this land, which if, so it were, there were no other witness of his Goatish
and Moorish inclination (as there are thousands) were it not enough to enroule
and memorize him in the rank of unworthie and tyrannous Potentates? For
Phillip the third, although he be young, yet is he a Spaniard: and whatsoever
the wisest of the world have ever thought of the nature and quality of a
Spaniard is apparent: For Francis Quicchardine (a man so sufficient, as the
very reckoning of his very worth and perfections would require a story) says
of them. The Spanish Nation are covetous and deceitful, and where they be at
liberty, exceeding outrageous, tyrannous, and very proud and insolent. And
Andrew.. a famous Senator of Venice, says of them; That they are unfaithful,
ravenous, and the most unsatiable of all Nations: For where is it (says he)
of all the places of the world, where these infamous Harpies set their feet,
which is not defiled with the footsteps of most abominable vices; and yet the
shot of their Pistols do so dazell the eyes of many in this land, that they
are not ashamed to defend them to be the most noble, most faithful, most
honorable Nation in the world. Another writes of them; That they are loathsome
Swine, theevish Owls, and bragging Peacocks: For (says he) whosoever would
behold the lively portrature of them, without troubling himself with the
overturning of Martial or Terence, let him but behold the grim speech of a
stately Spanyard. By whom, most mighty Prince, I may well say, and according
to truth, that the world of America was not so much unknown to the former ages,
as their monstrous outrageous, and new devised cruelties, which these divelish
and tyrannous Spaniards have unhumanely practiced amongst the simple and
innocent people, as appears by Don Bartholmew de la Casas Bishop of... and
other of their own Historiegraphers. And although my self, being a stranger,
which have some time served against them, both in the Indies and else where,
could say much of their cruelties, by relation of such their slaves as I have
taken, yet for that my eyes have not seen them, I will forbear in modesty to
charge them; only I will relate, from the mouth of a true reporter, a worthy
Gentleman of this land, Sir Francis Drake, one truth; that by that, your
Majesty might be induced to beleeu the rest. He once talking with me of the
Indies, told me, That he being in the South Sea, after he had taken his prize,
he had thought to have ventured to have come home by the Northward, and stood
his course to the I Will of Canes, being in 12 degrees of the North latitude, and
from thence to Aqua Palce, upon the maine, being 16 degrees, at one of the
poor towns of the City of Mexico; where going a shore, he found an old
Negro, tied in a chain of 20 yards long, which had been condemned by the
justice of the place; for that sometimes being oppressed with too much labor,
the poor old man would run into the woods, and absent himself from his
Majesty's work; his sentence was, that he should be whipped, with whips, till
he was all raw and bloody; and afterward being tied in a chain to be eaten
with flies; which poor soul he released from that miserable death, and took
him away with him: And therefore oh Turk, oh Scithians, and Tartarians, rejoice
ye now all, since now, there is to be found at this day a Nation in
Christendom, which by the unhappy and cursed behavior, do increase the
hatred that men have born to the barbarous and ungracious cruelties. And
therefore, most renowned Sovereign, I should be sorry, in regard of the premises,
that you should commit so great a fault in the government of the great and
mighty Kingdoms, which is not sufferable to a private Captain over a few
soldiers, to say, I do not think it: so when he has by his own temerity,
or fool-hardinesse, committed an action for want of due respect, to the
subjects, undertaken that has made him disastrous, and unfortunate in his
honor, and the times of his people, (which desire rather to give them received
Laws... For the desire of honor to advance States and enlarge Kingdoms, is
naturally grafted in the hearts of all Princes of noble spirits; and there was
never any King, of a worthy and high courage, but desired to leau to his
posterity the memory of some noble and worthy action (as the American world) by
doing whereof, you shall not only procure safety to your self, and those that
shall succeed you in your Royal Seat, but general happiness to so many
millions of people, which at this day sit in darkness and the shadow of death;
and is a thing so far from discommendation or reproach, as you shall be so
qualified in all succeeding ages, with the most happy, most gracious, and most
fortunate Princes of the world. But yet I do not deny, but Princes may have
such grounds and reasons to trust some private men, or foreign Princes, as
being deceived by them, and they should say, I never would have thought it, yet
are not worthy of reprehension: as for example; That Prince ought not to be
blamed, that has put in a Fortress some one Captain; or place, in a Country
some one Prince, either of which have received goods or honors from him, and
yet in the end is betrayed by them, and hereupon the knowledge thereof should
say, I would never have thought it, that such a man would have betrayed me,
that Prince is not to be blamed; as it happened to Lewis Morre Duke of
Millaine, who having committed the Castle of the City to one Damerdine Covet,
whom he had so absolutely raised, and made obliged to him by infinite graces
and benefits; yet notwithstanding was by the said Covet betrayed to his
perpetual dishonor and infamy. This Duke was no way to be blamed. As also
your Majesty ought not to be reproved, who providing for every mischief, is
assailed by some strange accidents, that was not possible for your Majesty, in
judgment or counsel to foresee, or prevent: as being not possible with reason
to foresee a thing, which of it self is a thing without reason. As for
example, was that most grievous accident of the powder, and other munition,
prepared to be sent to diverse places before the Castle gate of the said City,
which took fire, and was burnt by lightning from heaven when the weather was
fair and clear, whereby afterward ensued to the State so many losses and
discommodities: upon this occasion, if the Captain of the Castle should have
said, I had never thought that this weather would have brought so great and
unfortunate a chance to me, he had deserved no reproof at all. But if before
your Majesty's eyes, it be apparent, that a manifest known enemy to the State,
who as Demosthenes says, hates the very Religion of Athens, who has not
only long thirsted after the Seigniorie of your Kingdom, in his secret
designs, but likewise by open force of fire and sword has assailed them; If
you will trust such an one, and after upon his breaking say; You would not have
believed, that the King of Spain would have dealt so with you: Doubtless
(renoumed Sovereign) the world will not fail to tax you with such
carelessenesse and improvidence, as I hope shall never have any affinity with
your most Excellent Majesty, or any other of your Royal Offspring that shall
sway the Scepter of this noble I Will. And therefore (my gracious Lord) in my
judgment; you ought to do in this, so great a matter of State, as concluding
a peace with so dangerous enemies as the Spanish Nation, as good and wise
Carpenters seem to do in substantial buildings; which is, to make a sure
foundation, lest by aspiring mind or breach of the enemy you be overthrown.
And where as he says in the foregoing project, that he has right and good
title to the Crown of England, by virtue of his Grandfather and Predecessors
(which I know to be otherwise) yet contrarily can I prove your Majesty, by the
virtue of your Grandfather of famous memory Henry the 7, to be as rightful
Heir to all the firm land of the Indies, as the King of Spain is to the
Islands of Cuba, Iannura and Hispaniola, with the rest of the Islands of Lucaites
Grante, and A^tile: and for that it is not inconvenient fully to take notice,
and understand how these Kings intitles themselves and their Successors to the
right and Seigniories of the Indies, I have thought good to set down my
opinion, how many ways they do, or may take their claim: And first by
discovery; secondly, by the Popes gift; thirdly, by consent of the people;
fourthly, by conquest and consent. So as if neither of these, be able to prove
or give a good and sufficient title (or at least such an one as may bar you
and other Princes that will, to inhabit in those parts) I know no reason why
your Majesty should not do as he has done; that is, to possess as much as
you can of those Heathen Countries; especially where the Spaniard is not
seated, nor has no command: whereby you might not only propagate the Christian
faith, amongst those Pagans and Infidels, as you are bound to do, as much as
you can; but a golden world to the Crown of England: whereby you be more
enabled, as well to undertake a foreign war against the enemy of the
Christian name; as also to make your State the more strong by the Indian
treasures, against such of your neighbors as shall envy your Highness. And
therefore to come to his Title: If he claim his interest by possession, and
first Discovery (which doubtless must be the strongest Title that he can
challenge) then your Majesty has as much title for all the firm land of the
Indies, as he has for these Islands before named. As for proof of this, the
Captains of Henry the 7, being Sebastion Cabot, and his companions, discovered
the Island of the Indies, on the north part of the Indies, from 60 degrees,
coasting the north latitude; the very year before Christian Columbus
discovered the high land of Dania, on the south part of the Indies; which was
the first day that ever the Spaniards saw the maine, and took possession of
that new Discovery in the behalf of Henry the 7, and his successors their
Lord and Master. So, as if first Discovery and Possession be his Title, your
Majesty preceding him in that said Title, must necessarily precede him in the
right thereof. If he claim it by the gift of Pope Alexander the sixth, then it
must be argued whether the said Pope had power to give it; yea, or no; if not,
then the gift is void in it self: If yea, he must prove it either by Divine
or Human Arguments; for Human he cannot, for that no way belonged to him, or
any other Christian Prince or Potentate, at that time; nor were so much as ever
heard of, before that present Discovery of Columbus, upon which the gift was
made in the year of grace 1492. All things never known to him, or his
Ancestors, can no way of right belong to him or them; so as not belonging to
him, directly or by circumstance, he had no right to give or dispose thereof,
either in present or future, and thus for Human. For Divine Arguments; if he
say he gave them as Christ's Vicar, whereby he may dispose of Kings or Kingdoms,
he must prove that authority by the word of God, or else we are not bound to
beleeu him, or think his gift of any value: As for example, if he be but
Christ's servant here on earth, he must challenge to himself no more
prerogative then his Master took on him whilst he was on earth; for if he do,
it is a great token of pride and arrogancy: And our Savior being but
requested to make a lawful division of a certain inheritance betwixt one and
his brother, refused to do it; saying, Who made me a Judge over you; as also
he confessed openly to Pilate, That his kingdom is not of this world. Why then
does the Pope, who acknowledges himself to be no better then his servant,
take upon him the giving of so many Kingdoms of this world. But the Popes say
they, gave Ireland to Henry the 2, and his successors: and indeed they did so
in word; but when had he it? when he had fast footing in it, and when Dernitius
the King of Lemster had made the King of England his Heir. But for all that
donation, had not the Kings of this land, by the sharpness of the sword more
prevailed, then by this gift, the Popes donation had stood in little stead;
neither did the rest of the Irish Kings admit or allow of the Popes Donation;
for, if they had, they would never have rebelled so often against this Crown.
But to conclude this point; though we confess, that the Popes have done this,
or that; yet it is no good argument, in my opinion, to say that they did it,
and therefore it was lawful, unless they could show they did it rightfully.
But the Popes gift of the West Indies, may well be compared to the Sermon of
Judge Molineux his Chaplain in Queen Mary's days, who would make it appear, by
a lively text out of the Scripture to his Parishioners, what a lying knave the
devil was: and for his Text, he took the place where the devil took Christ,
and carried him up to the mountain, from whence he showed him all the Kingdoms
of the world; and told him, it he would fall down and worship him, he would
give them all unto him. My Masters (quoth he) by this you may well perceive
what a liar he is; for he had no more right to have given him these Kingdoms
(if would have fallen down and worshipped him,) then my self, that am now in the
Pulpit. If I should say to you all now; Sirs, if you will all fall down and
worship me, before I go out of the Church, I will give every man his
Copie-hold for ever; which if I should do, I should give you your livings in
words: But my Masters (quoth he) that sit there below to whom they belong,
would take them from you again: And therefore (says he) if he had given all
these Kingdoms to Christ, the Kings of the earth, to whom by right they did
pertain, would never have suffered him to have enjoyed them. And so for that.
-- For the earth is the Lords, and all that dwell therein, he founded and
prepared it, as in the Psalmist: and so consequently, neither the Popes, nor
the devils, do dispose to whom they please. The copy of which foolish
donation of the Popes, truly translated out of the original, has been
delivered to your Majesty long since, and (I hope) perused before this time.
To prove that he has no general consent of all the people and Nations of the
Indies, appears most evidently, by this reason; for that no Spaniard farther
inhabiteth northward then Florida, where they have but two little Forts or
Villages, the one called S. Austine, the other S. Helena: All the rest of that
huge tract, whose insinitenesse is such, (as no mortal tongue can express,
nor eye has seen,) do not so much as think there is another world but that
they themselves inhabit, except some few of them which dwell upon the edges of
the shore, that sometimes see both us, the French, the Dutch, and the Spanyard,
when we come a fishing, but are not able to distinguish of us, but think us all
one people: then how can we imagine, that these people have freely given
themselves to the Spanish obedience, and acknowledge him for their Lord and
King, when they never so much as heard that there was such a man or Nation.
Again, from Capi culli formia, all the land that runs and makes the stange
of Anian, and the Netherlands thereof, whose bounds and limits are never
discovered; the Spanyard has not so much as once seated himself to make
himself known, whereby there might be any likelihood that they had
acknowledged him for their Sovereign. And for us to beleeu that the Spanyard is
Lord of such, whom he has never seen nor known, nor they him, were a manifest
sign of a strong faith in us. And there were no way for any man to make me
believe Miracles sooner, then by making me believe this: for after the belief
of this, I should never doubt of any miracle, though he should tell me a
thousand in a day: So that if this title come not by consent of all in
general, he neither ought to write himself Lord of the whole Indies, nor
debar other Christians from conquering or trading in those parts where the
Spanyard has neither residence nor Seigniory, nor command. If he challenge
right by conquest and consent, then must he claim no more, then he has by
conquest and consent obtained. As for example, all that part of the West
Indies, which at this day is scatteringly inhabited by the Spaniards and
Portugals, is almost contained in two Tropicks, excepting the two small
Villages of Saint Augustine and Helena in Florida, the Province of new Biscay
Northwards, and five Villages or Towns near the River of Plate, called Sancto
Sprinto, Saint Anna, the City of Ascension, Saint Fee, and Fuvirnan, lies
half way betwixt the mouth of the river of Plate, and the Mine of Polossie;
and in the South Sea beyond the Tropic, in the Kingdom of Chelix, the Towns
or Villages of Coquenbo Persco, Saint Iago la impe: villa del Lago. And
therefore, if the Spaniards have nothing to do, any further; either to the
Northward or to the Southward; what reason has he to forbid any Nation to
conquer or dwell there? But if he should admit you, I think it not convenient
that your Majesty should be so satisfied, for so should you do your self, and
other Christian Princes, great wrong: for his Towns and Castles are so
divided, and such masses of land and Kingdom betwixt them, which he has no
right, nor dare to enter; as being duly considered by your Majesty, he ought
not to claim no more, then he ought to claim the Kingdom of France, because
his Fort of Graueling is of one side, and South Arabia on the other, France
being in the midst between them; or to claim France, because his Frontiers in
Italy bound it on the one side, and Spain, on the other: or to claim the
Island of the Venetians and the Turks in Levant; for that Cicilia and Sardinia,
and a few others belong to him, that stands in that sea: Or claim all the
Islands or Shoares in Barbary, for that he has a Castle or two in the Straits,
and another in Libia. These Countries they never lay claim to, because they
are in the eye of the Christian world; which would make us rise up in Arms
against them for their foolish arrogance, if they should pretend it: But in the
unknown parts, which have been familiar unto us; whose light by the iniquity of
the time, and troublesome wars in these parts, have to us been hidden,
although to the Ancient well known, where they began their foolerie. Betwixt
the Castle of Argiue in Libia, and the Island of Macoa in the river of Canton,
in the Kingdom of China, the foolish Portugals say all is theirs, when many a
hundred Kings (as absolute and powerful in regard of people, as any King in
these parts) dwells betwixt, and admit the Portugals by way of petition or
bribes, to dwell in some place by the Sea side, and trafique with them; neither
dare they lay claim to any Kingdom, but only to such Fortresses, Factories
and Villages, on the Sea side, as perforce and favor of the Island they are
permitted to dwell in, as most excellently appears by answer of Charles the
fifth, made unto the Ambassadors of Portugal, anno 1522, when they came to
require and beseech him, that his subjects the Spaniards, might not trade nor
commerce, as then they did, in the conquest or navigation of the Portugals; who
after a most peremptory and noble answer of his part, told them; he knew no
reason, neither would he suffer them, that his subjects should be prohibited
freely, to pass into any Country where the hope of gain offers it self; and
that if the Portugals in the cause of their Trade, should do any violence to
any of his people, either in their persons or goods, he would be revenged
nearer home, meaning upon the Kingdom of Portugal. With which answer, at that
time, the Lucitans were forced to depart. Which answer, if it should please
your Majesty to return upon the Castilians themselves, at this time, I know
no reason how it can any way be bettered, having so good a president, as their
own King against the Portugals, upon the same subject. But for the Portugals,
where all their strength is seated, I mean upon the coast of Malubor, where
they have more Fortes and Castles then in all India besides; the Kings do so
pen and lock them up in their Garrisons and Fortes, as they can have nothing
the Country yields, but by their friendship procured by yearly bribes; As
for example, to the King of Cathaie, they pay an yearly tribute of 256000 Reis:
to the King of Pimenta.. Reis: to the mother of the King of Pimenta yearly
36000 Reis; to the King of Pargnan yearly 72000; to the King of Manfata yearly
72000 Reis. To Carto Babua, the proper name of a man of account upon that
coast, an yearly tribute of 42000 Reis: to the Teratates, which are brethren
and Kings, an yearly tribute of 72000 Reis. All which sums or tribute, are
imposed upon the King, and Custom of goods, brought from these parts. As for
their credit and reputation amongst these Heathens, it is so small, either for
fear they have of them, or love they bear to them; that, when we, and the
Hollanders pay no custom for goods bought and sold there, they make the
Portugals pay 30 per hundred, we going free before their faces, and they paying
before ours.

By this, your Majesty may well perceive, what base account the Princes in
those parts make of them there; and yet these vainglorious Woodcoks, will be
very angry with us, if we will not believe, when they say, that all the East
Indies is theirs, and they have conquered it. In self manner (most renowned
Sovereign) stand the Kings of the West Indies, with the Spaniards, both in the
South sea, upon the Kingdom of Cheley, Reta, Peru, and others; as at this time
is apparent by the Kings of Cheley, who has within this few years beaten down
the Spaniard, and won from them the Town of Impetial, wherein was wont to be
placed and maintained, one of the greatest Garrisons of the South Sea; and not
only razed it to the ground, but likewise killed and driven the Castilians quite
from them. Even so, upon the East and North part of the Indies, both upon the
Coast of Brazil, with all the firm land upon the Indies from Parabia to
Cartagene, the gulf of Vraba, the gulf of Mexico, and all along the Coast
of Bahana, even to their Forts in Florida, they are in continual wars, with
the Kings and peoples of those lands. And surely under your Highness pardon, I
am confident of this opinion, that it has been a main policy of the Kings of
Spain, for these many years, to keep us in continual wars one with another
in these parts; or if not, to encourage us himself; whereby being forced to
look to our home defenses, we might not have means to discover these his
invasions abroad, whereby he puts a mask before all the Princes eyes of Europe.
And therefore since he is now laid open, and by no Nation so much as by your
Majesty's subjects of this land; I hope, for the prevention of future mischeife
against this State, as for other honorable respects, and prevailent Reasons,
in challenging of that which is your own; or at least as much yours as his; you
will no be unmindfull; which doubtless will not tend only to the enlightening
of many souls, which to this day have sat in the shadow of death, but
likewise lay a ground (as before said) for the safety and preservation of your
States, Glory, Person and Posterity, in despite of the Spanish treacheries in
the time to come, which otherwise by no means, by the wit of mortal man can
be prevented, as upon my life, by circumstances I will make apparent.

But least this field of reasoning whereinto I have walked be too tedious unto
your Highness, I will briefly end; referring my self to Argument with any
one, against this mischievous and poisonous peace with Spain, which I do see,
cannot but prove very fatal to your Majesty and Commonwealth. And though I
be not called, yet considering I am your subject, I cannot forbear, in
respect of my great and loyal affection to your Majesty, the Prince, with the
rest of the noble Issue, and my native Country, I cannot but presume to speak
of such things, which I think now fit to be considered: especially at this
time; even as Merca^ie Gata^er, Chancellor of Spain, did against the peace
that was concluded betwixt Francis the first, and Charles the Emperor his
Master; for he seeing, that the Emperor was disposed to make peace with the
said King, and to set him at liberty, and that the Viceroy of Naples, and all
other the Lords of the Council tended to the same, and although he knew, as I
do now, that his counsel would not be accepted, yet failed he not to speak
what he thought, but likewise refused, being great Lord Chancellor of Spain,
to sign the Articles, which he defended with most excellent reasons, which
reasons are well delivered, and with much gravity of speech by Quiccardine in
the oration of the said Gataner. But this event made it known, that the
counsel of Gataner was most noble, most just, and grounded as well upon the
high wisdom, as great zeal to the love and good of his Country. For as soon
as the King was at liberty, all the Spaniards wonderful hopes that they
expected of this peace, and all the French Kings great promises to them
vanished into smoke, according to the opinion of that worthy Gentleman. And I
know no reason (most noble Sovereign) that I being your subject, as he was the
King of Spaines, and loving you and my Country, as much as ever he did his, and
having a subject of the same quality, to fear, as he did them; although I may
well say, as much more danger to us by the Spaniards, if our peace be not built
upon a sure foundation, then it could any way be unto them by the French. But
to speak my opinion, make what Articles you will, and let them be gilded over
with the fairest show, either they, or those of their Faction (if you have any
about you) can devise; unless these four be granted on their part to you, you
can never make any sure peace with them: or at least such a peace, as if he
have the mind to break he will have the advantage of you. And Phillip Comines
says, That for the many conclusions that he has seen in his time in the
affairs of State, that it were inexcusable folly for a Prince, if he were able
for to prevent it, to put himself under the power of another. 1 That your
subjects may have free access to the Indies, either to traffic or plant,
where the Spaniards have neither conquest, Seigniorie, nor tribute. 2 That he
do pull down all inquisition wheresoever your people shall resort in all his
Dominions, and that the Customs be reduced to an ancient order. 3 That he
shall never come with a main Army of Ships into these Seas, under color of
chastising the Hollanders. 4 That it shall be as lawful for your subjects to
serve the States in wars against them, as it shall be to serve them against
the States; these things accorded, your peace may be safe, otherwise not.

A short view taken of Great Britain, and Spain.
HIs Majesty now is of more power then any his Predecessors; First, because
our addition of dominion Ireland, is reduced to a more absolute state of
obedience, and increase of revenue then heretofore. The footing we had in
France, was rather a greatness of trouble to us, then of strength; it was
always in division; it held us always in continual flux of treasure and
blood, we never attempted in the Front, but that attempted us in the Rear;
which did both distract our Armies, and aggravate our charge: It is a Territory
so separate from us by nature, as we could not advantage upon it, either for
offense or relief, without the access of difficulty and charge that a State
must undergo, when it runs the necessity of such an undertaking by sea,
where the war was bent upon a great Continent, a populous Nation, a
plentiful Country, and entire in its self, and that can be succored without
passing the Seas: In these things we found such disadvantage, as have been the
undoing of our Expeditions. In stead of departure of this broken Dominion we
had in France, his Majesty has brought another whole Kingdom to England,
undevided from us in seat; from whence we have these benefits. The back door
that was open in the assistance of our enemies, both to offend us, and divert
our attempts from them, is now open to us, and his Majesty has the key of it;
it saves us the money and the men that we were forced to employ in a second
Army for the withstanding the invasion on that side: and not saues it us only,
but renders it, to bestow in undertakings of profit, which we were wont to
spend upon defenses. We have another valiant Nation to assist us, whose service
in Low Country wars has often, and always, given this testimony of their
affection and faithfulness, even in Queen Elizabeth's time; that in every
National quarrel between us and others (which has often happened, and very
remarkable betwixt us and the French (they have voluntarily and bravely sided
with us, making the danger common both to themselves and us; which was drawn
out but particularly against the English. The joining of Scotland has made us
an entire Island, which by nature is the best fortification, and the most
capable of all advantages of strength, that by Art can be added unto nature;
whereby we may at one and the same time be able both to undertake any action
abroad, and defend our selves at home, without either much danger, or great
cost. Secondly, by reason his Majesty has the neighborhood of the powerfulst
nation by sea, that now is in the world, at his devotion: a people by nature
more worthy of credit with us then any other; the use of whose neighborhood
our own histories will commend unto us, if we enquire of the ages past, even
then when they wanted that power and knowledge in their industry, which they
now have, as well in matters of peace as war, the memories of those times
will tell us, that we seldom undertook any great thing without them; in so
much as our loss of France, may probably be in part imputed to the breach we
suffered in their friendship: and though they were then of the same Religion
with England, as likewise now they are, yet the present condition that we do
both of us stand in, for point of Religion, does place us in an estate of
better assurance with them, then the conditions of those times did; for then
considering no main National separation, in the Church Religion was, but a
common bond unto them, and inclined them to particular side, where now it has
the motive in it to make defense with, against an opposite Church, in such a
Nation, as has drawn both of us into one and the same cause in quarrel, as
well of policy, as of Religion: And lastly, their Army is the best Millitary
School of the world, from whence our Landservices may be sufficiently
appointed, at least with Officers.

Now for the hearts of our people, and the wealth of our Kingdom (though it
may be some of his Majesty's ill-affected subjects could be willing we should
distrust our own strength, when we receive these two points into our
consideration) yet for the first; the occasion, whereof they have derived from
our difference in Religion, I may say the wrath of God has been evident
against them, in the confusion of their plots (One thinks) it should be a
horror to them, for to think of attempting any farther that way; for those of
them that have made a covenant with blood, we stand not either in fear or need
of their numbers, but we may both spare and suppress them: And far be it
from me to think, that many men of those that hold no communion in the Church
with us, should give other Nations the cause to say, that in England are the
false men, that take up Gods weapons against him, and their own weapons
against themselves, in favor of a foreign Ambition, that makes the pretense
of Religion but a port hole to lay his Artillery out at, or his scaling ladder
to assault by. Now the second point touching the wealth of the Kingdom, if I
should call the Council of Spain it self to give judgment in the cause, I
should need no better sentence to condemn their opinions, who think the King
of Great Britain poor; their Master knows it well enough, he shall find it
otherwise, whensoever he shall undertake to attempt us, or we them.

Now for Spain, his Majesty there, though accounted the greatest Monarch of
Christendom; yet his estate being enquired thoroughly, his root will be
found a great deal too narrovv; for the top of his Dominions are so far in
distance asunder, as they cannot give relief time enough one to another upon
an alarm; which is the reason he is more powerful to assault then defend,
and therefore are compelled to have continual Garrisons of that charge he is
unable to maintain: he has more to do with shipping then any other Prince,
and yet has fevv men at his devotion, but by extreme charge, and those of
vvorst sorts; his poverty has therefore appeared in the mutenie of his Lovv
Country Army, for want of pay, which was great cause of his ill success
there; and I cannot see how his estate can be much better now then it was. For
though it be true, that his charge is somevvhat less; yet it is likewise
true, that his Subsidies in Spain be also diminished; as well in respect of
insupportablenesse, as of indisposition of his Revenues out of the Indies
decayed: And indeed but for his Indies, he were the poorest Prince in
Christendom. Now it serves the better for the finding his weakness or
strength, to inquire whether he be able to stand upon the terms of defiance,
and yet hold his Indies, I think not: for his Majesty of Great Britain,
joining with the States of the United Provinces, is of power to raise Armadoes,
the one to block up Spain, the other the Indies; the least success that may be
hoped for out of this enterprise, the cutting off his return would beggar him:
the fear of this project was the thing that stopped his Greatness to the
United Provinces, when he departed with his pretense of Sovereignty to them:
and that fear is an Ague he is not yet cured of. This is a right design, and a
great one, such a one, as I wish we had the treasure, and valiant blood of our
Ancestors to bestow upon; for the expense whereof we have nothing to show now,
but two poor Islands Iarsey and Garnsey. And to say the truth in that case; if
all the Islands or Lands that belong unto the Crown of England, were offered to
his Majesty, I should not give my advice to receive them, much less to
conquer them. Now for the disposition of the Low Country men, I assure my self
there cannot be a thing more desired, then they to join with his Majesty in
any undertaking, especially in this: for they are sorry they understood the
King of Spaines weakness so little in Queen Elizabeth's time, when her
Majesty so much affected their joining with her; and that now they know it,
his Majesty being greater in power, will yet suffer such an enemy to all
Christian Princes, chiefly to those of his Majesty's Religion to creep into his
bosom: For all the greatness he has, he holds by the courtesy of his
Majesty, (and to that end Courts it;) he knows he were undone else. To
conclude, I will infer some of the Reasons, that persuade to the undertaking
of his design, the policy of Spain has trodden more bloody steps then any
State of Christendom; look into his Treaties, and his Negotiations of his
Ministers abroad, you shall find as much falsehood in them, as blood in the
other: He never paid debt so truly, as those he imposed in corrupting of the
Ministers of other Princes; He holds league with none, but to have nearer
access to do him harm: a Match in kindred shall not hinder it when he
apprehends his advantage: He disturbes all Christendom with his Alarums and
Armadoes yearly; and yet does less hurt to Infidels and Pirates then any,
unless it be to get wherwithall to arm himself the better against other
Christian Princes; and he has an ambition to the whole Empire of Christendom.
These are motives wherein all Christian Princes are interessed, so as with
reason they cannot oppose the design, nor will (I think the most of them) he
has brought himself into such an hatred with them. Let us, between his
Majesty and the United Provinces, consider how the particular causes of both
Nations do importunate us both to the undertaking thereof. Who has been so
thirsty of our blood as Spain? And who has spilled so much as he? Who has
been so long our enemy? And who has corrupted so many of our Nation as Spain?
And that all with the help of gold, which by reason of the neglect of this
Design he does still enjoy, tempting our weak ones, and our false ones
withal. Would you find a Traitor on a sudden? Balaams Ass will tell you
where, at the Spanish Ambassadors door? And when? when they come from Mass,
and otherwise. When to? when they Match with us. For his malice is so great he
cannot hide; nor will God (I hope) suffer it. Yet let us examine in reason: now
if we be so charitable as to forget what is past, whether we may promise our
selves assurance of his amity for the time to come or not? Because peace with a
true neighbor is a condition to be embraced, nothing more certain then the
contrary. We cannot promise it, his ambition to the Empire, so long as he holds
the Indies, shall never die. The United Provinces is an Object, which though he
has an eye to, yet he likes not. What other thing so ever we communicate with
him in, we shall never be assured of him (such is the nature of his Religion,)
so long as we differ in matter of faith, he knows very well the peril he
stands in, if he be attempted by his Majesty and the United Provinces.
Consider what suggestions these are to keep him thinking upon; and imagine
then, what his own part will prompt him to do when he sees a time for it. He
then to the end hurts, that he may not be prevented by the Enterprise. Now of
the fitness and honor of it, to be in that undertaking of his Majesty, who
is the greatest Ilander in Christendom, and therefore a Navy most proper to
him: He is a Defender of the Faith, as well in understanding, learning and
godliness, as in title; therefore in the planting of the true Church, there is
a sacred work, that even by office, as it were, belongs unto him: He is of a
great liberal mind, the Indies will afford him means to exercise it. These
Considerations, and the great multitude of his subjects, do seem to invite
him: and in every part, considerable in the Design, we may find something to
persuade us, that it seems to be a kind of offer, both in Religion, Policy and
Nature, preferred unto his Majesty; as the Prince for maintaining of it.

FINIS.
