Newly joined to a Loueletter sent by a Bacheler, (a most faithful Lover) to
an unconstant and faithles Maiden.

Imprinted at London, by Richard Ihones dwelling in the upper end of
Fleetlane: at the Sign of the spread Egle.

THE PRINTER TO the Reader.
What lack you Master mine?
some trifle that is true?
Why? then this same will serve your turn
the which is also new.
Or if you mind to read,
some Fables that be fained:
Buy this same Book, and ye shall find,
such in the same contained.
Perchance my words be thought,
incredible to you:
Because I say this Treatise is,
both false and also true.
The matter of it self,
is true as many know:
And in the same, some fained tales,
the Auctor does bestow.
Therefore, bye this same Book,
of him that haere does dwell:
And you (I know) will say you have
bestowed your money well.
Farewell
To her unconstant Lover.
As close as you your wedig kept
yet know the truth I here:
Which you (yer now) might me have told
what need you nay to swear?
You know I always wished you well
so will I during life:
But since you shall a Husband be
God send you a good wife.
And this (where so you shall become)
full boldly may you boast:
That once you had as true a Love,
as dwelt in any Coast.
Whose consta^tnesse had never quaild
if you had not begone:
And yet it is not so far past,
but might again bewonne.
If you to would: yea and not change
so long as life should last:
But if that needs you marry must?
then farewell hope is past.
And if you cannot be content
to lead a single life?
(Although the same right quiet be)
then take me to your wife.
So shall the promises he kept,
that you so firmly made:
Now choose whether ye will be true,
or be of SINONS trade.
Whose trade if that you long shall use,
it shall your kindred stayne:
Example take by many a one
whose falsehood now is plain,
As by ENEAS first of all,
who did poor DIDO leave,
Causing the Queen by his untruth
with Sword her heart to cleave,
Also I find that THESEUS did,
his faithful love forsake:
Stealyng away witout the night,
before she did awake.
JASON that came of noble race,
two Ladies did begile:
I muse how he durst show his face,
to them that knew his wile.
For when he by MEDEAS art,
had got the Fleece of Gold
And also had of her that time,
al kind of things he would.
He took his Ship and did away
regarding not the vows:
That he did make so faithfully,
unto his loving Spowes,
How durst he trust the surging Seas
knowing himself forsworn?
Why did he escape safe to the land,
before the ship was torn?
I think king Aeolus stayed the winds
and Neptune ruled the Sea:
Then might he holdly pass ye waves
no perils could him stea.
But if his faise head had to them,
bin manifest before:
They would have rent ye ship as soon
as he had gone from shore.
Now may you heave how falseies is
made manifest in time:
Although they that commit the same,
think it a venial crime.
For they, for their unfaithfulness,
did get perpetual Fame:
Fame? wherefore did I term it so?
I should have called it shame.
Let Theseus be, let Jason pass,
let Paris also escape:
That brought destruction unto Troy
all through the Grecian Rape,
And unto me a Troylus be,
if not you may compare:
With any of these parsons that
above expressed are.
But if I can not please your mind.
for wants that rest in me:
Wed whom you list, I am content,
your refuse for to be.
It shall suffice me simple soul,
of thee to be forsaken:
And it may chance although not yet
you wish you had me taken.
But rather the^ you should have caush
to wish this through your wife:
I wysh to her, ere your her have,
no more but lost of life.
For she that shall so happy be,
of thee to be elect:
I wish her virtues to be such,
she need not be suspect.
I rather wish her HELENS face,
then one of HELENS trade:
With chastnes of PENELOPE
the which did never fade.
A LVCRES for her constancy,
and Thisbie for her truth:
If such thou have, then PETO be
not PARIS, that were rueth.
Perchance, ye will think this thing, rare
in on woman to find:
Save Helens beauty, all the rest rare
the Gods have me assignd.
These words I do not spek, thinking
from thy new Love to turn thee:
Thou know by prof what I deserve
I need not to inform thee.
But let that pass: would God I had
Cassandraes gift me ient:
Then either thy ill chance or mine
my foresight might prevent.
But all in dayne for this I seek,
wishes may not attain it
Therefore may hay to me what shall,
and I cannot refrain it.
Wherefore I pray God be may guide
and also thee defend:
NO worser then I wish my self,
until thy life shall end.
Which life I pray God, may again,
king Nestors life renew:
And after that your soul may rest
amongst the heavenly crew.
Thereto I wish king Xerris wealth,
or else king Cressus Gould:
With as much rest and quietness
as man may have on Mould.
And when you shall this letter have
let it be kept in store?
For she that sent ye same, has sworn
as yet to send no more.
And now farewell, for why at large
my mind is here expressed?
The which you may perceive, if that
you do peruse the rest?
FINIS.
Is. VV.

The admonition by the Auctor, to all young Gentilwomen: And to al other Maids
being in Love.
YE Uirgins yt from Cupids tents
do bear away the so^yle
Whose hearts as yet with raginge-love
most paynfully do boil.
To you I speak: for you be they,
that good adusee do lack:
Oh if I could good counsel give
my tongue should not be slack?
But such as I can give, I will,
here in few words express:
Which if you do observe, it will
some of your care redress.
Beware of fair and painted talk,
beware of flattering tongues:
The Mermaides do pretend no good
for all their pleasant Songs.
Some use the tears of Crocodiles,
contrary to their heart:
And if they cannot always weep,
they wet their Cheeks by Art.
Ovid, within his Art of love,
does teach them this same knacke
To wet their hand, and touch their eyes:
so often as tears they lack.
Why have ye such deceit in store?
have you such crafty wile?
Less craft the^ this god knows would soon
us simple souls begile.
And will ye not leave of? but still
delude us in this wise?
Since it is so, we trust we shall,
take heed to fained lies.
Trust not a man at the first sight,
but try him well before:
I wish al Maids within their breasts
to keep this thing in store.
For trial shall declare his truth,
and show what he does think:
Whether he be a Lover true,
or do intend to shrink.
If SCILLA had not trust to much
before that she did try:
She could not have been clent forsake
when she for help did cry.
Or if she had had good advice
Nisus had lived long:
How durst she trust a strainger, and
do her dear father wrong.
King Nisus had a Hair by fate
which Hair while he did keep:
He never should be overcome,
neither on Land nor deep.
The stranger that ye Daughter loved
did war against the King
And always sought how yt he might
them in subjection bring.
This Scylla stole away the Hair,
for to obtain her will:
And gave it to the Stranger that,
did straight her father kill.
Then she, who thought her self most sure
to have her whole desire:
Was clean reject, and left behind
when he did whom retire.
Or if such falsehood had been once,
unto Oenone known:
About the fields of Ida wood,
Paris had walked alone.
Or if Demophoons deceit,
to Phillis had been told:
She had not ben transformed so,
as Poets tell of old.
Hero did try Leanders truth,
before that she did trust:
Therefore she found him unto her
both constant, true, and lust.
For he always did swim the Sea,
when stars in Sky did glide:
Till he was drowned by the way
nere hand unto the side.
She scrat her Face, she tare her Heir
(it greueth me to tell)
When she did know the end of him,
that she did love so well.
But like Leander there be few,
therefore in time take heed:
And always try before ye trust,
so shall you better speed.
The little Fish that careless is,
within the water-cleare:
Now glad is he, when he does see,
a Bayt for to appear.
He thinks his hap right good to be,
that he the same could spy:
And so the simple fool does trust
to much before he try.
O little Fish what hap had thou?
to have such spiteful Fate:
To come into ones cruel hands,
out of so happy state?
Thou diddst suspect no harm, when thou
upon the bait did look:
O that thou had had Linceus eyes
for to have seen the hook.
Then had thou with thy pretty mates
bin playing in the streams
Whereas sir Phoebus daily does,
show forth his golden beams.
But since thy Fortune is so ill
to end thy life on shore:
Of this thy most unhappy end,
I mind to speak no more.
But of thy Fellows chance that late
such pretty shift did make:
That he from Fishers hook did sprit
before he could him take.
And now he pries on every bait,
suspecting still that prick:
(For to lie hid in every thing)
where with the Fishers stricke.
And since the Fish that reason lacks
once warned does beware:
Why should not we take heed to that
that turns us to care.
And I who was deceived late,
by ones unfaithful tears:
Trust now for to beware, if that
I live this hundredth years,
FINIS.

A Loueletter, or an earnest persuasion of a Lover: sent of late to a young
Maiden, to whom he was betrothed.

Who afterward being overcome with flattery, she seemd utterly to swerue from
her former promise without occasion, and so to forsake him.

By VV. G.



A Loueletter, sent from a faithful Lover: to an unconstant Maiden.
AS duty wills, so nature moves,
thy friend these lines to wright:
Wherein thy fraud, (O faithless thou)
I mind to bring to light.
Can plighted faith, so firmly plight,
without desert be moved?
Or should the man that faithful is,
so slenderly be loved?
Should hate his guerdon (...), remain
in place of thy good will?
Should rigor reign within thy breast
to vanquish reasons skyll?
Should faith to falshed so be changd
(alas) the greater ruthed
When double dealyng is preferred,
before a perfect trueth^^
Of case such hap, as recompense,
unto your friend you yield?
What Bulwark can thou claim,
against Gods thy self to sheilde?
Can they that sit in hauty Heavens
such covert gilt abide?
Or ar they parcial now deemst thou?
is Justice thrown a side?
May just are they, and justice still,
as just, they justly use:
And unto them, as giltlesse then,
can thou thy self excuse?
No, no, not so, for they be hold,
thy double deades, be sure:
Do forged style, nor flattryng phrase
their favor may allure.
No gifts, no gold, can them corrupt
such justice there does reign:
And they that disobey their heastes,
are subject unto pain.
These are no nouel news I tell,
the proof is plainly known:
To such as do offend their wills,
their power forth are shown:
To see thy conscience, gylty is,
thy faithles frawde they see:
And thinkste thou then, this gilt of thine,
can unrewarded be?
O Faith, think not so far to wish,
from reasons lymyts pure:
But judge thy self, what justice they
to sinful ones inure.
And thy self such domb, shall give,
as gilty shall thou find:
Therefore relent, and once again,
thy grudging conscience mind.
Which unto Gods that sacred are,
as gilty thee he wray:
In place of fraud, let faith and truth
with thee now hear the sway,
Revoke and call to memory,
the fruits of friendship shown:
Perpend in mind, my torments strong
my playnts and pensive moan.
Which six years long, as pacionate
to caryyng yoke of care:
I bod for thee, as thou they self,
I know can well declare.
Remember thou the plaints and tears,
which I powrd forth for thee:
And ponder well the sacred vow,
that thou have made to me.
Which vow gave comfort to thy friend
that subject served to grief:
Thou gave thy self a pledge to me,
thy faith was my releffe.
But now what helyth hagge? (alas)
has tournde thy love to hate:
Or else what whelpe of HYDRAS kind
in thee has wrought debate.
Alas, will thou dispoyle me quight,
of my possessed joy?
Or wilt you plunge me headlong thus,
to gulphes of great annoye?
Who would a thought (alas)
such fraud to rest in thee?
Who would have deemd withou desert
thy heart should change from me?
Whose heart has coucht his tent,
within my covert breast:
And thine I hopte, of me thy friend,
likewise had been possessed.
But waueryng minds I plainly set,
so compassed with guile:
Pretend by slights, the perfect joys,
of frindes for to exile.
O, should a pratlyng Parasite, so egg
thee with disdain?
That thou the presence of thy friend
through flattery should refrain?
Not vouching once to speak with him
whose heart thou have in hold:
Since likeing same has granted grace
should love so soon be cold.
Consider these my letters well,
and answer them agenne:
For I thy friend in covert zeal,
this time has closd my pen.
Farewell, a dieu tenthousand times,
to God I thee commend:
Be seching him his heavenly grace,
unto thee still to send.
Thy friend in wealth, thy friend in woe,
Thy friend while life, shall flytt mesroe:
And whilst that you, enjoy your breath,
Leave not your friend, unto the death:
For greater praise cannot be won,
Then to observe trueloue begone.
FINIS.

R W Against the wilful Inconstancy of his dear Foe E. T. Which Example may
justly be a sufficient warnyng for all Yongmen to beware the fained Fidelytie
of unconstant Maidens.
All youthful Mights at lyberty
whom LOVE did never thrall,
I wish that my deray may be,
a warnyng to you all:
That have a soar bred in my Breast
although it be not strange:
Yet will it bring me to the Grave
without some sudden change.
For I by Suit have served one
two years and somewhat more,
And now I can no longer serve
my heart it is so sore.
Which heart I let to Userie
through gredie fond desire:
Not doubting to receive home twain
when I would them require.
But if that every Userer
had such good hap as I,
There would not be so many men
would use this Userie.
My Debtor has deceived me
for she is from me fled:
And I am left among the Briars
to bring a Fool to Bed.
So that I seely man remain
each day in doubtful case:
For DEATH does daily lie in wait
to rest me with his Mace.
And cast me into Prison strong
the Door is made of Grass:
And I might bles my hour of birth
if it were come to pass.
For lo my careful choice does choose
to keep me still in thrall,
And does regard my love no more
then Stone that lies in wall:
Whereby I see that Women's hearts
are made of Marble Stone
I see how careless they can be
when pensive men do moan.
I sowed both pure and perfect seed
on fair and pleasant ground
In hope though harnest brought some pain
some profit might be found.
But now the Harvest ended is
and for my faithful Seeds
And all my pain and labor past:
I have naught else but Weeds.
I thrust my hand among yt Thorns
in hope the Rose to find.
I pricked my hand and eke my heart
yet left the Rose behind.
Not I, but many more I know
in Love do lack relief,
But I as cause does me compel,
do wayle my pain and grief,
I doubtless can not be the first
That Love has put to pain,
Nor yet I shall not be the last
that Women will disdain.
If I poor wretch should think upon
the pains that I have past:
Or if I should recount the cares,
that she has made me taste
Into Despair it would me drive,
and cleave my heart in twain:
Or else bereave me of my Wits
to think upon the pain.
I never spent one day in Joy
my careful heart does know,
Since first I lent my Love to her
by whom my grief does grow.
There are no greater pains assignd
for dampened Ghostes in hell:
Then I do suffer for her sake,
that I do love so well.
The Price that I have paid for love
not many men do give.
But I my Bargayne shall repent
as long as I do live.
I paid for love and that full deats
yet I receive right naught,
I never was so much deceived
in any thing I bought.
If every woman on her friend
such pity use to take,
Then shortly men will ron to love,
as Bears unto a stake.
But now let VENUS fire her forge
let CVPIDS Shafte be sent:
They can no more increase my woe
for all my Love is spent.
But here good Reader thou may see
how Love has paid my hyre,
To leave me burning in the frame,
compeld to blow the fire.
But if that thou good friend desire
to live in happy state?
Then seek in (...) if thou mis(...)ap,
Repentance comes too late.
Frequent not Women's company
but see thou it from them swerve
For thy Reward shall be but small,
whateuer thou deserve.
Take heed for you may come in the all
Before that thou beware:
And when thou art entangled once
thou can not fliethe snare.
Take thou not this to be a Jest,
but think it to be true,
Before thou prove as I have done,
least proof do make thee rue.
Yet if thou chance to place thy love
take heed what than do sat:
And see thou place thy talk in Print
or else beware a fraie.
And thus I end: not doubtyng but
these words may well suffice,
To warn thy gredie bart of harm
and ease thy rouing eyes.
Ease by Disease,
has made me to halt,
Time has so turned
my Sugar to Salt.
FINIS.
