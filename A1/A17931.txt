AT the reverence and worship of ye blessed trynyte and of ye glorious virgyn
saint mary / and the conseruacyon of the common well of christian people as well
for them yt be hole as for remedy of them that been seek. I the bishop of
Arusiens in the royalme of denmark doctor of physycke will write by the most
expecte and famous doctors auctorysed in physyque some things of ye Infyrmyte
of ye pestylence which daily enfecteth and soon suffers us to depart out of
this life. First I will write ye tokenes of this infyrmyte / The second / ye
causes whereof it comes. The third remedies for the same. The.uij. comfort
for the heart and the pryncypall members of the body. The.v. when it shall be
season to be let blood. First I said ye tokens of this infyrmyte.vij. things
ought to be noted in the same ye first is when in a summers day the weder
oftentimes chau^geth as in ye morning the weder appears to rain / afterward
it appears cloudy and at ye last wind in the south. The second token is when
in somer the days appears alder ke and like to rain and yet it rayneth not /
and if many days so co^tynue it is to dread great pestylence. The third token
is when great multitude of flies ben upon ye earth then it is sign / yt ye
air is venymous and infecte. The.iiij. token is when ye sterres semen
oftentimes to fall / than it is token ye the air is infect with much venomous
vapors. The.v. token is when a blasynge sterre is seen in the element above /
then it should fortune sone after to be great manslaughter. in battle. The.vi.
token is wha^ there is great lyghtnynge and thundre namely out of the south.
The.vij. token is when great wyndes passen out of the south / they be foul
and unclean / therefore when these tokens appear it is do dread great pestylence
but god of his mercy will remeue it. These things following ben the causes of
pestylence. Thepestyle^ce comes of.iiij. things / sometime it comes fro the
rote byneth other while fro ye rote above to yt we may feel sensibly how the
change of the air appears unto us / and sometime it comes of both together as
well. fro the rote above as fro the rote byneth / as we see a sege or a preuy
next to a chamber or of any other pertyculer thing which corrupts ye air
in his substance and qualyte which is a thing may hap every day / and
thereof comes the ague of pestylence / and about the same many physycyons be
deceived / not supposing this axes to be a pestylence / sometime it comes of
deed careyn or corrupcion of standing water in dyches or sloughes and other
corrupt places / and these things sometime be universal and sometime
particular. Fro the rote above it fortuneth ye causes of the bodies above the
air by whom the spyryte of life is corrupt in man or be as Auice^ce says
in his.iiij. book / by ye form of thayr above the bodies byneth lightly be
infect / for thynpressyons above corrupts the air and so the spirytes of man
be corrupt / this infyrmyte comes from the rote above / and bynethe when of
thynpressyons above the air is corrupt / and of the putryfaccyon or roten
carcyne / or of vile places byneth an infyrmyte is called in a man / or such an
Infyrmyte sometime is an axes / sometime a postome or a swelly^ge and that is in
many things. Also the air inspyred sometime is venymous and corrupt / hurtynge
ye heart / yt nature many ways is grieved so / yt he perceyueth not his harm
for ye vyrgyn appears fair and shows good dygestyon yet nevertheless ye
pacyent is like to dye / wherefore many physycyens seeing the vryn of their
pacyentes yt speak superfycyally and be deceived. Therefore it is need that
every pacyent prove to him self a good and expert physycyen. These things
written be fore are ye causes of pestylence. But about these things two
questyons be moeued. The first is wherefore one dies and a another dies not in
a town where me^ be deed in one house / and in a another house there dies
none. The second questyon is whether pestylence sores be co^tagyous. To ye
first questyon I say it may hap to be of tho causes / yt is to say of ye
thing yt does and of ye thing that suffers / an example of ye thing that
does / ye Influence of the bodies above beholds that place or that place more
than this place or this place / and the pacyent is more disposed to dye tha^
another. therefore it is to be noted yt ye bodies be more hot dysposed of open
pore than bodies Infect having the poores stopped with many humors where
bodies be of resolucyo^ or opening / as men which abusen them self with women
or use often times bathes / or men yt be hot with labor or great anger they
have their bodies more disposed to this great sekenes. To the second questyon
I say yt pestylence sores be co^tagyous by cause of infect humors of bodies
and thereke or smoke of such soores is venymous and corrupts ye air and
therefore it is to flee for such persons yt be infect / in pestylence time no
dody should stand in great prece of people by cause some man of them may be
infect. Therefore wise physycyens in vysyty^ge seek folk stand far fro ye
paciente holding their face toward ye door or wy^dowe. And so shol de ye
servants of seek folk stand. And it is good to a pacyent every day, for to
change his chamber / and to have the wyndowe open against ye north and eest /
and to spear the wyndowes against the south / for the south wind has two
causes of putryfycacyon. The first is it makes a man beynde hole or seek feeble
in their bodies. The second cause is as written in ye third of Amphyrosmis ye
south wind greueth ye heerynge and hurts ye heart because it opens ye
poores of man and enters in to the heart / wherefore it is good to an hole man
in time of pestylence when the wind is in the south to be within the house all
day and if it shall be need a man to go out / yet let him abide in the house
till the son be up in the eest passing southe ward The remedies of
pestylence here after follows. Now it is to wete by what remedies a man may
preserve him self fro pestylence / first so ye writing of Ieremye ye prophet
yt a man ought to forsake evil things and do good deeds and mekely to
confess his sins / for why it is the highest remedy in time of pestyle^ce /
penance and confession to be preferred of other medycynes. Nevertheless I
promytte you verily it is a good remedy to void and change thynfect places.
but some may not prouffytably change their places / there fore as much as to
them is possible it is to eschew every cause of putryfaccion / and namely
every flesshely lust with women is to be eschewed Also the sothern wind
which is naturally enfecteth therefore spear ye wyndowes against the south as it
is said before un to the first hour after the mids of ye day. Then open ye
wyndowes against ye north. Of ye same cause every foul stynche is to be
eschewed / of stabyll stynkynge feldes ways or streets / and namely of
stynky^ge deed carayne and most of stynky^ge watres where in many places water
is kept by.vij. days or.ij. nyghtes / or else there be gutters of water
casten under the earth which causes great stynke and corrupcyon and of this
cause some deye in yt house where such thy^ ges happen / and in a another house
dye none as it is said before. like wise i^ yt place where be wurtes and coals
putrefyed it makes a noyfull sauoure and stynkynge for as by the sweet odoure
of bawme yt heart and the spyrytes have recreacion / so of evil savors they
be made feeble wherefore keep your house that an infect air enter not in / for
an Infect air most causes putry faccyon in places and houses where folk
sleep / there fore let your house be clean and make clear fire of wood
fla^mynge / let your house be made with fumygacyon of herbs / that is to say
with leaves of baye tree Ieneper vberyorgany it is in thappotycary shoppes /
wormwode rewe mugworte and of yc tree of aloes which is best but it is dear.
Such a fumy taken by the mouche and eres opens thynwarde parts of the body.
Also it is teschewe all great repleccyons by cause full bodies by lightly
infect / as Auice^ne says in the fourth canon / they yt chargen their bodies
with respeccion / shorten their life. Also common bathes are to be eschewed /
for alytell crust corrupts all ye body Thefrore ye people as much as is
possible is to be eschewed / leest of infect brethes some man be infect / but
when the multitude of people may not be eschewed. then use the remedies
following. In the morning when ye rise / wasshe a little rewe and one or two
fylberde nottes clean with salt and ete them / and if yt can not be had than ete
bread or a toste sopped in veneger namely in troublous and cloudy weder. Also
i^ the time of pestylence it is better to abide win the house / for it is not
wholesome to go in to cite or town / also let your house be sprynkled specially
in somer with vyneger and roses and with leaves of vine tree. Also it is good to
wasshe your hands often times in the day with water and veneger / and wype your
face with your hands and smell to them. Also it is good always to sauoure
ayger things. In the mount of pessane I might not eschew the company of
people for I went for house to house because of my pouerte to cure seek folks
/ therefore bread or a sponge sopped in vyneger I took with the holding it to
my mouth and nose because all egre things stoppen the ways of humors and
suffers no venymous things to enter in to a man's body and so Iescaped the
pestylens my fellows supposy^ge yt I should not live / these things I have
proved by my self. Here follows the co^fortes of ye heart and of ye
pryncypall members. The co^fortes of ye her te be these / saffron auisex
plantayn: with other herbs they open the inward spyryte / and these be good
among the common people where lightly it happens yt on is inefete of another
therefore be ware the brethe of a another. Also of an Infect air a man's eyes be
made dymme if he bear not ye foresaid things in his hand Also it is wholesome yt
ye wasshe your mouth face eien and hands oftentimes in the day with rose water
medeled with veneger / and if ye have no rose water take veneger and so these
things used ye may go surely among the people. Also a natural lax of the
belly is a great remedy else provoke a lax be a supposory craftly / use pypylle
pestile^ciales for they be good / they be in thappotycarye shoppes. Also keep
fire always in your house for it lets much the Impressyons of the bodies
above and clarefyeth the air. Also it is profitable as well for and hole seek
folks to drink tryarle therefore take it.ij. rymes a day with clean wine
limphat or with clear rose water or with clear ale / take a quantyte of tryacle and
two sponefull of clear wine or rose water or ale dyssoiue the tryacle in the
cup and dry^ke it and dyne not till ye mids of the day ye the tryacle may
have his operacyon / then chese a good dysshe with mete / and dry^ke clear wine
and often times drink in the day but not much together / for much
hadoundaunce of drink putryfyeth the humors. Also beware hot things in
metes as peper and garlyke / though peper purges the brain from the flewme
and specially ye members from vycyous humors / yet it makes much hete / and
hete falls in to putryfaccion / bytternes only is more please than hot
odoure or sauoure. Also garlyke though it purges flewine and put out all
humors and provoke an appetyte to ete and suffers no dry air to enter yet
it troubles the eyes and makes the head hot therefore it is not good to ete
garlyk. The pestylence grows often times of an hot cause therefore all metes
the more they be light dygestion so much they be the better / In the morning
ete boiled mete at even roasted / forbere brothe and potage with out they be eyger
/ in ye time of this sekenes eyger meters be better tha^ other. Also for bear
all fruytes but if they beeyger / as cheryes or pome garnates or a little of a
pere or apple by the way of medycyne / because all fruit enduceth putryfacryon
/ ete conuenyent spyces as gy^ger synamum common macys and saffro^ / these be
the best sauce may be made for rich people / for poor take rewe sage
fyllberde nottes percely with veneger my^ste together these be good and lets
putryfaccyon. To be merry in his heart is a great remedy for health of his body.
Therefore in time of this great Infyrmyte he ware ye dread notdeth but live
merely and hope to live long.

For the lettynge of blood.
Lettynge of blood ones in the month may be made / but age or other things
forbede it as pylgryms or feeble perfones ye have the flyxe / suffer to be let
blood in ye vain called basilica on the right or lift side before ety^ge / and
after incision of the basilisca be merry and drink wine or ale temperatly /
sleep not yt day wha^ basilica is but / if ye sele you grieved to be infect /
than eschew sleep and be walking and moeuynge / for by sleep thynwarde hete
induces poison to ye heart and to other special members / so ye uneath any
herb may take away such poison / which should not be if a man would be
moeuy^ge to and fro / but some would say wherefore should flepe be eschewed / I
say shortly yt in pestylence time anon after mete if a body list to sleep /
then such a lust ought to be forborne by a space walky^ge in the gardyns or
feldes / and therefore Auicenne writes ye if a man would sleep he must drink a
good draught of ale or wine a fore / because a man being a sleep draws many
humors / and ye cuyl humors be put down by thumours of a good draught. But
some would understand how man a may felt when he is infect / I say that a man
which is infect ye day he eteth not much mete / for he is replenysshed with
evil homours / and forth with after dinner he has lust to sleep and feleth
great hete under cold. Also he has great pain in the forhede but all these
things he may put away by moeuynge of a place hyder and theder to ride or to
walk he may not for sloth / of the body and the weight of the same. Also a
man which is infect has lust to sleep every hour for the vemyn wtin the body
troubles the spyryte of life so yt always he would rest and sleep and so of
these tokens a man shall know and feel him self infect / and if a body will
not believe this. Abide the mids of ye day / and then anon he shall feel a
swelly^ge under the arm about the share / or about the eres and therefore se
an hye and a good medycyne / forbere sleep because of the things aforesaid /
and it is plain that ye spyryte of life rests in sleep and all the body here
and there is venymed. All these things I have proved by my self / these
things known when a man feleth him felfe infect as soon as he may let him be
let blood plenteuously till he swoune / then stop the vain / for a little
letynge of blood moeueth or styreth vemyn / if a man will not have many veins
kut together / then let him suffer ye vain kut to run till ye blood with draw
/ for alytell bledy^ge meueth strongly ye venym as it is said before also a man
whether he be infect or not if he be let blood let him forbere siepe all that
day till mydnyght folowy^ge / and always let blood ye vain upon ye side of the
body where ye swelly^ge appears. Therefore if a swellynge appear under ye right
arm let blood in ye mids of ye same arm in the vain called medtana / if it
be risen. But and if yt he feel any such swelly^ge after his sleep / then
upon the contrary part the lettynge of blood must be made / as for if the
swellynge or rysynge appear in the right arm let him bold in the lift
arm in epate or (basilica) or mediana. And if that a swellynge or a moeuynge
appear under the left arm let him blood in the right arm like wise as it
be foresaid of the lift arm / and so of all other places of the body / let
blood on the contrary part of such swellynge or rysynge. And that the
lettynge of blood be veraye little and feeble / Then let the pacyente sleep
after the mids of the day / and then always within the mids of the day
/ for he must be in contynuelly meuynge riding or going moderatly / and
afterward if that the swellynge grow let him not be a frayde of death by
cause such a swelly^ge puts out all manner of euylles / and makes a man
very hole. And that the sooner a swellynge may be made type / take this
medycyne as follows. Bruise the leaves of an elder tree the which ben fair and
great and put thereto mustarde the which shall be well and strongely grounden
in a pair of quernes / and then when ye have done as I have told you / take
and drive a plaster of the foresaid things good and thyche and after put it
upon the sore and swellynge and it shall aledge him anon of the foresaid
sykenes Also for the foresaid swellynge / or rysynge in the neck / or in the
arm / or money other place of a man's body when it appears take fylberde
nottes fygges and rewe and bruise them together in a mortar well and lay it
upon the swellynge. And if that it appear under ye left arm let him blood in
ye mids of the same or i^ ye vain of ye liver which is above ye little
finger / and if it be about the share let him blood about the here upon ye
same side / if the swelly^ge be in the neck let him blood in the vain called
cephalica about the thombe in ye hand in the same side or in the vain called
medsana of the same arm or in ye hand of the same side about the little
finger / if ye swellynge appear about the ere let him blood in the vain
called cephalica of the same side or in ye vayn which is between the long
finger and the thombe / lest many venymous things go in to the brayn / or let
blood the vain which is about the little finger ye is named by physycyons
basilica / and if a swelly^ge appear in the sholders less it with ventosyte
and first lest the vain called mediana / if the swellyngs be on the back /
less it upon the vain called (pidia magna) and all these things be made if
man sleep not before yt knowledge of ye swelly^ge. some surgeons will put
treacle to ye swellynge But do not so / for tryacle puts out venym. Therefore
dry^ke tryacle for ye put teth out the same. Also there is another medycyne
take syngrene hylworte other wise called wild time mawdelyn grass plantayne
and a little rye flower and break all these together till yese water come out
there of / meddle yt water we woman's milk and give it to the pacyent fasty^ge
before sleep and will work the better for to remeue the swelly^ge. These
redmeyes be suffy cyent to eschew this great sickness with the help of god to
whom be ever lasty^ge laud and praysy^ge world with out end. Amen.
