Laud, A Commendation of Virgyll

To the, and thy dulce ornate fresch endite
May reverend Virgil, of latin poetis prince
Gem of ingyne, and flude of eloquence
Thou peirles peirle, patron of poetry

Lantern, lade stern, myrrour, and a per se
Master of maisteris, sweet sours and springand well
Wide quhare over all, ringis thine heuinly bell
I mean thy crafty werkis, curious
Sa quyk lusty and may sententius
^lesand perfyte, and selabill in all degree
As quha the matter beheld, before there. E.
In every volume, quhilk the list to write
Surmonting fer all, A comparison.

Like as the rois, in June with her sueite smell
The Marigulde or Dasy, doith excel
Quhy should I than, with dull forhede and vane
With rude ingyne, and barane emptiue brane
With bad harsk speich, and lewit barbare tongue
Presume to write, The Auethoris humilytie.

Or counterfete sa, pretius wordis deir

For quhat compare, betuix myd day and nycht
Or quhat compare, betuix mirknes and lycht
Or quhat compare is, betuix blake and quhit
Fer greter defference, betuix my blunt endite
And thy scharpe fygurate, sang virgiliane
So wisely wrocht, vythoutyne word in vane
My wavering wit, my cunnyng febill at all
My mind misty, (...) may not mys ane fall
Stra for this ignorant, blabering Imperfite
Beside thy polist terms, redymyte
And netheles with support, and correctioun
For natural luf, and freyndly affectioun
Quhilkis I bear, to thy werkis and endite
All thoucht god wate, I know tharin full lyte
And that thy facund sentence, mycht be soung
In our langage, als weill as latyne tongue
Als weil na na; Impossibil be perde

I wald, into my vulgar rurale gross
Write sum savoring, of thy Eneados^
Bot sare I dread, for to distene the quyte
Throw my corruppit cadence, imperfyte
Distene the na forsooth, that may I nocht
Weill may I schaw, my bureil bustious thocht
Bot thy work shall endure, in laud and glory
But spot or falt, condign eterne memory
Thocht I offend, vnwennyt is thy fame
Thine is the thank, and mine salbe the schame
Quha may thy versis follow, in all degree
In bewte sentence, and in grauite
Nane is nor was, nor it salbe trow I
Had, has, or sall have sic craft in Poetry
Of helicon so drank, In Tatyne roung Vyrgill excellis all other Poetis both in
sentence and eloquence

That of thy copious fouth, or plenitude
All men purchesce drink, at thy suggerit tone
So lamp of day thou art, and schynand sone
All vtheris one force, mon their lycht, beg or borowe
Thou art wesper, and the day stern at morrow
Thou Phoebus, lichtuare of the Planetis all
I not quhat deulie, I the clepe sall
For thou art all and sum, quhat nedis more
Of latyne Poets, that sens war of before
Of the writis macrobius, sans fail
In his great volume clepit, saturnale
Thy sawis in sic eloquence, dois flete
So inuentiue of rethorik, fluris sweet
Thou art, and has, so hie profound sentence
Tharto perfyte, but any indigence
That na louingis, He is happy, whose ^ame another praise reprou^e (...) envy

Nor na reproach, dymynew thy good name
Bot sen I am compellid, the to translait
And not only of my curage, god wate
Durst I interprise, sic outrageous folly
Quhare I offend, the less reprefe serf I
And that e know, at quhais instance I tuke
For to translate this may excellent buke
I mean Virgillis volum may excellent
Set this my werk full febill be of rent
At the request, of ane Lord of renown
Of ancestry nobill, and Illustir baroun
Fader of bukis, protector to science and lare
My special good Lord Henry, Lord Sinclare
Quhilk with great instance, diverse times sere
Prayit me stranslaite Virgill, or Homere
Quhais plesoure soithle, as I understood
As nere conionit, to his lordschip in blude
So that me thoch, this requeist ane command
Half disparit this werk, I tuke one hand
No^ fully grantand, nor anys sayand e
Bot only to assay, how it mycht be
Quhay mycht ganesay, ane Lord sa gentill and kind
That ever had any courtasy, in their mind
Quhilk beside his innatiue policy
Humanite curage fredome and cheuelry
Bukis to recollect, to reid and se
Has great delight, as ever had Ptholome
Quharfor to his nobilite, and estate
Quhatso it be, this buke I dedicate
Writt^n in the langage, of Scottis natioun
And thus I make, my protestatioun.
FIrst I protest, A protestacion to the Reader.
good Readers be our lest
Be weill auisit, my werk or e repreif
Consider it werly, read ofter than anys
Weil at ane blenk, sle poetry not tanc is
And it forsoith I set, my besy pane
(As that I couth) to make it, brade and plane
Kepand no sodroun, bot our awin langage
And speak as I learned, quhen I was ane page
Na it so clean, all sudroun I refuse
Bot sum word I pronuce, as nychboure dois
Like as in latin been, grew terms sum
So me behuffit quhilum or be dum
Sum bastard latyne, Frensche or ynglis ois
Quhare scant was scottis, I had nane vthir chois
Not that our ^oung, is in the selu^ skant
Bot for that I, the fouth of Langage want
Quhare as the color, of his propirte
To keip the sentence, thareto constrenit me
Or that to make my sayng, schort sum time
Mare compendius, or to likly my ryme
Tharfor good freyndis, for ane gympe or ane bourd
I pray ou note me not, at every word
The worthy clerk; hecht laurence of the veil
Amang latyne ane, great clerk sans fail
Grantis quhen twelf, eris he had been diligent
To study virgil scant, knew he quhat he meant
Than thou or I my freynde, quhen we best wene
To have virgil red, vndirstand and seen
The richt sentence, perchance is fer to seik
This werk tuelferis, first was in making eik
And not corecke quhen, the poet can deceis
Thus for small faltis, my wise freynde hald thy piece
Adherand, to my protestacioun
Thoch wylliame Caxtoun, had no compatioun
Of Virgill in that buk, (...).
he preyt in prois
Clepand it Virgill, in Eneados
Quhilk that he sayis, of Frensche he did translait
It has na thing ado, therewith God wate
Nor na mare like than the Devil, and sanct Austin
Have he na thank tharfore, bot lois his pyne
So schamefully, the story did peruerte
I reid his werk, with harms at my heart
That sic ane buk, but sentence or ingyne
Should be intitulit* eftir the poet divine
His ornate goldin versis, mare than gylt
I spitte for disspite, to se them spylt
With sic ane wicht, quhilk treuly be mine intent
Knew neuir three wordis at all, quhat virgill meant
So fer he chowpis, I am constrenyt to flyte
The three first bukis, he has ouerhippit quyte
Saiffing ane litill, twiching polidorus
And the tempest, set forth by Eolus
And that full simpilly, on his owin gyse
Virgill them wrate, al on ane other wise
For Caxtoun puttis, in his buke out of tone
The storm forth sent, by Eolus and Neptone
Bot quha sa redis Virgill, soithfastly
Sall find Neptone, sayffit Eneas navy
Me list not schaw, quhow the story of Dido
Be this Caxtoun, is hale peruertit so
That beside quhare he fenis, to follow bochace
He rynnys so fer fra Virgill, in money place
On sa prolixt, and tedious fassyoun
So that the ferd buke, of Eneadoun
Twiching the luf and deed, of Dido queen
The tua part of his volume, does contene
That in the text of Virgill, traistis me
The tuelf part skars contenis, as e may se
The fyft buke, of the feistis funeral
The lusty gammys, and playis palestrall
That is over hippit, quite and left behind
Na thing thereof, e sall in Caxtoun find
The sext buke eik, he grantis that wantis hale
And for thereof, he understood not the tail
He callis it fenete, and nocht for to belief
Sa is all Virgill perchance, for by his leif
Juno nor Venus goddis never were
Mercury, Mars, Neptune nor Jupiter
Of fortun eik, nor her necessite
Sic thingis not attentik, ar wate we
Nor it admittis, that quent Philosophye
Haldis saulis Hoppis, fra body, to body
And money thingis, quhilk Virgil did rehers
Thocht I them write, forth followand his verse
Nor Caxtouns schrinkes not, sic like things to tell
As not war fabil, bot the passage to hell
Bot traistis well, under derk Poetrye is hid great* wisdom and lerni^g
quha that ilk sext buk knew
Virgil tharin, ane hie Phylosophoure him schew
And under the cloudis, of dirk poetry
Hyd lyis their money, notabill History
For so the Poetis, be their craftye curys
In similitudis, and vthir quent figuris
The soithfast matter, to hide and to constrene
All is not falls, traist weil in case they fene
Their art is so, to make their werkis fare
As in the end of virgill I sall declare
Was it not eik als possibill Eneas
As Herculus or Theseus, to hell to pas
Quhilk is na gabbing, su^hly nor na lie
As Ihone bochas, in the genologie
Of goddis declaris, and like as ye may reid
In the recollis of Troy, quha list take heed
Quha wate, gif he in visioun thidder went
By art magik, Sorcery, or enchantment
And with his faderis saul, did speik and mete
Or in the liknes of sum other spreit
Like as the sprete of Samuel I ges
Rasit to King Saul, was by the Phitones
I will not say, all Virgill been als true
Bot at sic things ar, possibill this I schewe
Als in they dayis, war ma illusiouns
Be Deuillis werkis, and coniuratiouns
Than now their been, sa can clerkis determe
For blissit be god, the faith is now mare ferme
Inewch thereof, now will I no more said
Bot unto Caxtoun, thus I return agane
The names of Cieteis, or pepyll been so bad
Put be this Caxtoun, bot that he had been mad
The flude of Touer, for tyber he had write
All men may know, their he forueyit quyte
Palent the ciete, of Euander King
As virgill planely, makis rehersing
Stude quhare in rome, now standis the chief palice
The samyn buke, eik in, mare heit malice
One the self river of touir, says planelye
Eneas did, his ciete edify
Thus aye for Tiber, Touer puttis he
Quhilk money hundredth mylis sundry be
For sikkirly les, than wise authoris leyne
Eneas saw never Touer, with his Ene
For Touer diuidis, greece from vngary^
And Tiber is chief flude, of Italye
Touer is kend, ane grane of that river
In Latyne hecht, Danubium, or (...)
Or gif it be Tanayis, he clippis sa
That flude diuidis Ewrope, fra Asia
Elikewise eik, this Caxtoun all in vane
Crispina, clippis Sibilla, Cwmane
That in the text of Virgil, traistis us
Hate Deyphebe, Douthter of Glantus
Quhilk was Eneas, conuoyar to Hell
Quhat should I langer, on his errouris duel
They been so plane, eik and sa money fold
The hundredth part thereof, I leif unfold
The last sext buke of Virgil, al in feris
Quhilk contenis, strange battellis and weris
This ilk Caxtoun, so blaitlye lattis over slip
I hald my tongue for schame, bitand my lip
The great affers, of athir oist and arraye
The armor of Eneas, fresche and gaye
The Quent, and curious castis poetical
Perfyte similitudis, and examplis all
Quharin Virgil beris, the palm and lawde
Caxtoun for dreid, they should his lippis skaude
Durst never twiche this vark, for laike of knalage.
Because he onderstude, not Virgils langage
His buk is na mare like Virgil, dar I lay
Than the night oule, resemblis the papingay
Quharfor ou gentill Redaris, Exhortacion to the Reader.
I beseiche
Traist in na wise, that this my werk be siche
Quhilk did my best, as the wit mycht atteyne
Virgillis versis to follow, and na thing feyne
e worthy nobillis, redis my werk for thy
And cast this other buke, on side fer by
Quhilk under color, of sum strange wycht
So frensihly leyes, uneath tuo wordis gais rycht
I nold e traist I said, this for dyspite
For me list with no man, nor bukis flyite
Nor with na bogill, nor browny to debaite
Nowthir auld gaistis, nor spretis deed of lai^
Nor na man will I lakkin, nor despise
My werkis till authoris, be sic wise
But twiching Virgyllis honor and reverence
Quho ever contrary, I mon stand at defense
And bot my buke, be foundin worth sic three
Quhen it is red, do warp it in the seye
Thraw it in the fire, or rent it every crum
Twiching that part, (...) unto unlearned people / whose rudnes cannot

Vyrgil in there.vi forsaid beukis, follouis the moist excellent greik poet
homer, in his odisse, of Ulysses, schawand Eneas lang navigations, and great
perillis, and dangeris on the se.

Now in the syxt bukis heir after, he followis Homer in his Iliada, discryuing,
the horrybil battellis, betuix the Troianis, and the Italianis. He pantis Eneas
to be a prince, Endued, with all nobyl, and princly verteous, both of body and
of mind, featis of war excellyng al vderis, and was of sic clementy. In that
these quhom he had subdewit in war, with his great gentylnes wan theme, to be
his very frendys, he was virteous, sincer, gentill, and liberal. In justice,
wisdom, and magnanimitye (...) myrroure to all Princes Quhas verteous, gif the
Princes of our dayis, will follow, they schal not only be favored of god, bot
also weil beloved of al good men. Their Impyr. Kingdoms, and posteritye,
schalbe the mair durabyll. for it is vertew, that ever has promoued commoun
welthys. And vice has ever been the catis of dystructione of the same, as we
read in all historyis, both civil and ecclesiastical.

Quharfor, lat every nobyll Prince, that desiris to cum to hye honor, and
great fame and name, after this life, fear God, luf vertew and justice, heat

War horsemen send to turnus, for to se
Quhat he plesit, and at the kingis intent
Till him to schow, three hundredth men forth went
With scheild on schulder, under capitane Wolstens

To procure in haist, by woundis ane honest deed

And lukand vpwart towart the clear moan

Quhay mycht perfectly, al his hie terms luge
In barbare langage, or them deulie expone
Bot well I wate of his sentence wantis none
Quha can do bettir lat se, quhare I foruayit
begin of new, al thing is good vnassayit
F^r ethar is quha list, sit down and mote
Ane vthir sayaris, faltis to spy and note
Than but offense, or falt them self to wit
bot for to chyde, sum been so birnand hot
Bald they their piece, the word wald skald their throat
And has sic custom, to Iangil and bakbite
That bot they schent, sum they should birst for site
I say no more, quhen al their rerd is roung
That wicht mon speik, that can not hald his tongue
Go vulgar virgil, to every churliche wycht
Say I auow, thou art translatit richt
Beseik al nobillis, the correct and amend
Beis not effrait, to cum in prisaris sicht
The nedis not to eschame, for thy licht
For I haif brocht thy purpois, to good end
Now sal thou with every gentil s^ot be kend
And to vnletteryt folk, be red on hicht
That erst was, bot with clerkis comprehend
Finis.
To know the name of the translator.
THe gaw vnbrokin, mydlit with the wine
The dow ioned with the glass, richt in ane line
Quha knawis not the translatouris name
Seik no forther, for lo with lytil pyne
Spy leile this verse, men clepis him sa at hame
Finis.
