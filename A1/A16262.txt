The most wonderful and pleasant History of Titus and Gisippus, whereby is
fully declared the figure of perfect frendshyp, drawn into English meter.

By Edward Lewicke.

Anno. 1562.

Aristotell.
Frendshyppe is a virtue, Aristo,

For all men to take hold,
Frendshypp joined with virtue,
Passes silver and gold.
As fire and heat Seneca.

Are in seperable always
So are the hearts of friends
From day to day.
THere was in the city of Rome,
A noble man hight fulnius:
A Senator of great wisdom,
One of the chiefest the truth is thus.
He had a son named Titus,
An apter child could not be found,
(As witty men did their discus)
For learning, going on the ground.
Fulnius love did so abound,
To Titus for his native grace:
That to athenes he sent him round,
Because he should learning enbrace.
Whereof Athenes was the best place.
With one Chremes, Titus did host,
Who had a son so like of face
To Titus that Chremes (...).
Knew not his son, his mark was lost?
For their statures and age were one,
Their garments both a like did cost,
On all the earth lo there were none:
So like of beautye blood and bone.
Gysippus hight Chrimes sons name:
Together still would they have gone,
To scole, to meals, to play or game.
Their wills and wits both, like did frame,
In oue doctrine they did delight,
What one did tone, the very same,
The other loved with all his might,
In learning they were justly pight,
For yer that they much time did spend,
In Athenes was not many a wight,
Would in learning with them contend^.
At last when God by death did send,
For Chremes, in his ancient age,
Gysippus goods was without end,
He was of noble parentage,
And eke a propre personage:
Wherefore his friends did him allure,
And still provoke to marriage,
Saying thereby you may be sure.
Your progeny shall long endure,
To your great honor and comfort,
Thus daily they did him procure.
But Gisippus (for to be short,)
To their counsel would not resort:
For he was wedded to study,
Philosophy was all his sport,
Except Titus, his friend onelse:
Whom he so loved, that (well nie)
For other things he did not care.
Titus also (a good cause why)
Would for Gisippus his life spare,
Such friendship has been seen but rare.
Gisippus fearinge that a wife,
Should cause their friendship sone to ware,
Which he had lever lose his life.
Then with his friend to fall at strife:
Fearing left through marriage also,
Which caused him to be penife,
Philosophy he should forgo,
(And leave his scole alas for woe)
Which thoughts made him for to abstain
As much as in him lay to do,
His kinsemens advise to refrain.
But yet they did him so constrain,
By calling on so importaunt,
That needs he must (though to his pain
Seeing they cried incessaunt)
To all their requests thoroughly grant:
Titus also did him desire,
That he would not be repugnaunt,
But do as they did him require.
Or else said he their fervent ire,
Against you always shall be bent,
As furious as the fretting fire:
Therefore it is expedient,
(Dear friend Gysippus) to content
Your self: and set your heart at rest,
Chouse you a wife by mine assent,
Even such a one as you like best.
Gysippus with this meke request,
To his friend Titus did agree:
What need much talk to be expressed,
His friends a maiden did forsee,
No meter match they thought might be
Then she, for such a worthy wight,
In beautye bright, peareles was she,
Sophronia this maiden hight.
When they and her friends had full right
The covenant of this marriage knitte,
Gysippus then to have the sight
Of this lady they thought it fit,
And said also, that best were it,
For him, this maiden to behold,
Whom when he saw in shape and wit,
Like him, his joys could not be told.
He louid her so that often he would
Resort unto her secretlye,
Leaving Titus his lover old
Behind, applying his study.
Yet at the last he did descrye,
himself, and told Titus his mind.
How that her gentle courtesye.
And beautye clear, had him enclinde.
So on a time he had assinde,
To have his friend Titus with him,
To se Sephronia so kind,
Which to Gysippus seemed trim,
And as well shapt in every lim.
When Titus came in her presence,
His will above his wit did swim.
To se her good entelligence.
And how at their engredience,
She did Gisippus entertain,
With courtesye and reverence.
With rare and sober talk right plain,
So well placed and not in vain,
The sweet and pleasant countenance,
That in her visage did remain,
With louelye looks and temperaunce.
So that he fell into a trance,
Beholding of her sweet visage.
And sore abashed at the chance,
That frendshippe could it not assuage,
Nor yet Philosophy the rage?
Of pricking with blind Cupides dart,
For in beholding her image,
Her beautye perced him to the heart.
But yet he showed not his smart,
Till they to their lodginges were gone:
Then Titus drew himself apart,
His misery for to bemone:
And when he was himself alone,
Upon a bed there down he lay,
For other help he looked none,
But only death his care to stay.
There cursed he the time and day,
That he into this world was borne,
O death said he, fetch me away, The complaininge of Titus.

would god I were with tirantes torn,
O that Rhynos with his sharp horn,
Would rid me of my miserye:
Oh cursid Titus and forlorn, Rhinos is a certain beast in the countreise of
India having a sharp horn gro wing out of the nos trilles of his nose, and
an other in his neck, this beast is as big as an Elephant and is naturally an
enemy to the Elephant.

Why swaruest thou so sore awry.
Oh traitor Titus well worthy,
For thy treason to Gysippus,
A miserable death to dye.
Thus wept and wayled poor Titus.
No man in the cause that could descus,
Nor whereof his care did depend,
But always Titus would say thus,
Would god my life were at an end.
With that the salt tears would dessend,
Down by his chekes like floods of rain,
The deep sightes from his heart would wend,
Which well declared his mortal pain.
But at the last for to be plain,
For lack of sleep and sustinaunce,
So feebleness did him constrayne,
To keep his bed this was his chance.
He was so hurt with Cupides lance,
That naught his pains might pacify.
When Gysippus (to his greuaunce)
Heard that Tytus was like to dye,
He ran in all have by and by,
God knows with a woeful heart,
But yet he looked cherefullye,
To comfort him as was his part.
But when he saw the color swart.
Which had been like the ruddye rose,
Titus said he, whence comes your smart,
Dear friend to me se you disclose.
And though that I do spend and lose,
My goods and lands your care to slake,
My life from me will I depose,
Dear Titus for your only sake.
Then Titus as his heart had brake,
The tears afresh he did renew.
Which made Gisippus heart to ache,
Seeing more doloure still ensue.
Dear friend said he no more rescue,
Nor hide your mortal pains from me:
But show that I may them subdue,
If any help for you may be.
Thus wise Titus constrained he,
Which all blushing and ashamed,
Talking with great difficultye,
Shamefastly holding down his head.
My most dear loving friend he fed, The words of Titus to Gi^sippus.

Withdraw your gentle courtesy,
Let no mo tears for me be shed,
But slay me rather where I lie.
Or otherwise on me hardlye,
Take vengeance most writched villain
And of all other most worthy,
I am to suffer death and pain,
For whereas God of nature plain,
In one likeness has both us made,
So had he trapped in one train,
Our wills that we in weal should wade.
So that the like recourse and trade,
Of concord that has been between
Us two, ye and so stedfastlye laid,
I do suppose has never been,
The like in lovers ever seen:
Yet notwithstanding all this love,
This faith this trust is wasted clean,
A woman's look has gone above.
Alas what wicked spright did move,
Your mind to bring me in presence,
Of her whom ye (as I can prove)
Beholding beawtye and prudence,
Could not with hold by no defense,
Your mind from rauishinge with lust,
Alas where was your sapyence,
That you in such things would me trust.
Wist you not that our winds were just?
Forgot ye quight our like nature,
Which thing ye ought to have discuss?
This is the cause I you ensure
Of this mischief that I endure.
Your trust have trapt me in the rays,
That issue from her eyes demure,
Remembering eke her virtuous lays.
Which perceth my heart a thousand ways
So that of all things I desire,
Sharp death to end my doleful days,
Confusion eke to be my hire.
Since I against you did conspire,
Such treason so unnatural:
Desiring so iustlye your ire,
Shame and reproach perpetual.
Unworthy am I for to call
Or say Gisippus is my friend,
Sith frendshippe in me is so small,
With those words Titus made and end,
The sighs that from his heart did wend
So heavy were and so profounde,
The tears from his eyes dessend,
As he to salt drapes might redounde
Gysippus then with cherefull sound,
And with a louelye countenance,
Not raginge rashlye in that stounde,
Although he sorowed at the chance: The answer of Gisippus to Titus.

But with a friendly affiaunce.
Enbracinge him and sothlye said,
Why Titus is this your greuaunce,
That you so long from me have stayed?
I have (it can not be denayed)
Offended as I here confess,
In that which you did me enbrayde,
I acknowledge my folishnesse.
Dear friend Titus, ye are faultlesse,
For truth it is that I forgate,
(In f^we words brefely to express,)
The unity of our astate.
For what I love you do not hate,
But love it in as high degree:
Our constellacion or fate
Is one, I know it so to be.
Therefore the fault lies all in me,
(No man the contrary can prove,
Since that I caused you to see,
Sophronia whom I do love.)
Since that ye have so stoutlye strove,
Against the power of Cupides might,
Which has so many nobles drove,
And slain them quite in his dispight?
Think you (dear friend) my wit so light,
That I know not how that venus,
Will wou^d those, against whom she fight,
With deadly dent? yes yes Titus.
Have ye not well strove that have thus,
Resisted such a great Gods,
Almost to death for Gysippus?
Was not this very noblenes?
What friendship could you more express,
Then to withstand such violence?
Am I so virtuous to distress,
Or stop the heavenly influence.
Preordinate by providence,
Divine? what were (if I so thought)
My time of long and large expense,
What were my learning dearly bought,
Or yet the wisdom I have sought?
In deed Titus I loved the maid,
As much as any wise man might,
And had my heart unto her slayde.
I was of her better apaid.
Then of all my treasure and land,
But yet what though, what may be sa^^,
Since that your love (I understand)
Does far surmount if it were scand,
A boue the compass of nature?
I know you can not slake the band
Of venus, it is knitte so sure.
What shall I judge, a mind vnpure,
That you do this of wanton lust?
Nay Titus I will not procure,
Such things against you so unjust,
Dear friend in this you may me trust.
For how should I of right contend,
Except that good reason should rust,
And so our frendshippe come to an end:
Since that we never yet did spend,
One word in malice day nor night:
So to be still else god defend,
And bring the error sone to light.
Nay nay Titus I have done right,
The providence of god only,
Has wrought this thing with his great might
That she should be your own lady
For such love enters not but by,
A disposicion divine,
Into a wise man's memory:
I can it no ways else define.
Whereat if I should now repine,
I should seem stout and obstinate,
Against that god does determine,
And rightes from you to separate.
Which never shall early nor late,
Be found in me therefore I say,
Dear friend Titus and loving mate,
Let not this chance your mind dismay.
Put sorrow from you quight away,
Rejoice now and no more be sad,
Let not this woe your wealth decay,
For certeinely I am right glad
That such a wife is to be had, In those days not withstanding any ceremony
done at the church, the marriage was not confirmed un till night that the
husband had put a ringe on the brides finger, and losed the girdle of her
virginity, andech of the^ promissyd loyalte one to another.

And that it is my chance to find,
Her, with whom your life may be lad,
In joy according to your mind,
Whereby you may increase your kind,
To the comfort of your lignage,
I have to you my right resinde,
Of her: therefore your old courage.
Take unto you and your visage
all to be wept, wash it right clean,
For now the day of our marriage
approaches nigh, therefore sum mean,
Let us (this time and that between)
Devise, how that you may attain,
Your whole desires which have been,
The only patron of your pain.
Mark well, this is mine advice plain,
You know well that our shape is so,
That in like garments of us twain,
Few men do scant know who is who.
Although that we together go.
Much les a part and liklye dight
Shall they desearne each of us two,
And brifelye of us judge the right.
Also ye know that until night,
The marriage is not confirmed,
That they their trouthes have plainly plight,
And that a ring there prepared,
On her finger be fastened,
Her girdle then must be untied,
And then may they two go to bed,
And perform the parts of a bride.
This means for you I will provide:
Until that day be past and gone,
In sum close place you shall abide,
Being prepared for you alone.
When night is come feately anon.
To her chamber your self convey,
Of maids nor wifes there is not one,
that for our shap shall you bewray.
Then quicklye do your self vnray,
And vno bed, bouldly prepare,
Your ring on her finger assay.
Louse her girdle and do not spare,
But yet be circumspect and ware,
That no fond thing in you appear,
Whereby you may augment your care,
Now friend Titus be of good cheer.
Let no things be for you to dear,
Take good refections and solace,
For to amend your lothlye leare,
Your wan and pale colored face,
That it be not in any case,
The cause of your discovering.
I know within this little space,
That you your purpose thus having.
My friends will hate me and thinking
Me to disgrace my familye.
But let god worck I care nothing,
Though I be had in obloquye,
Increasing your felicity.
At those words Titus then began
To moan, as on my fantasy,
He though Gysippus spoke not than
But thought he did a vision scan,
As one adremed in a sleep,
Lay still as an abashed man.
But when he saw Gysippus weep,
And tears by his chekes down did stepe,
Perceyuinge love in explicable:
He gave him thanks with groninges deep,
For his kindness incomperable.
And said it were more reasonable,
That such unkind wretches as I,
Should perish with some death notable*
Then that you should sustain thereby,
Any reproach or injury.
Eftsone Gysippus did protest:
And kissed Titus lovingly,
Saying dear friend be you at rest.
For look what things I have protest,
Feign would I have accomplished,
And thereto will I do my best,
At those words Titus perceived,
That his frendshipe was not fained,
And starte up then as one not sick,
But from sleep he had waked,
his blood resorted sum what quick.
For good eats then he did not stick,
But took things his health to restore,
So that shortelye he waxed trick,
In figure as he was before,
To health was turned all his sore,
Short tale to make, the marriage drue,
The widdinge wedes, Gysippus wore,
Of costly colored, cloth of hue.
And did as unto him was due,
His friends he accompanied,
The damuseles house they did cusue,
Where they were ioyouslye feasted.
Gysippus was entertained,
So lovingly of his fair maid,
That all the people there praised,
To se that sight were well apayde.
And each unto his fellow said,
(Praising the virtue and beautye,
Wherewith those parsons were araide.
And eke their gentle courtesy)
That never erst they could espy,
Their virtues rare, so excellent,
In any creatures save only,
Those two which then were there present
What need much talk for to be spent,
The wedding day away did pass.
Their friends also, away they went,
The bride eke as the custom was,
Was brought with many a lovely las,
To a chamber most freshlye dight,
Gysippus then returned as,
He told Titus he would that night.
Then Titus he stepped in full light,
Anon to bed he did prepare,
The maid as soon eke as she might,
Lay down by Titus naked bare,
Not knowing of the subtle stare,
But thought it had been Gisippus,
Then Titus ending all his care,
Demanded of her saying thus.
Sophronia flower of Uenus,
Do you love me and not disdain,
That in this bargayne between us,
I shall your husband still remain?
In health and wealth, in joy and pain?
Wherewith she smiled all blushinge,
Her maydenhode like to refrain,
With eyes half laughing, half murning.
To his reqnestes she affirminge,
Eftsone he asked her also,
If that she would receive his ringe,
Anon she did consent theretoe,
Her girlde then he did undo,
His ringe he put upon her hand,
What else he did, non, but they twoe
Knew that, yet this I understand.
That all the treasure in the land,
Could not have pleased him half so well,
As did the lousinge of the band,
Which made him suffer pains of hell.
When morrow came, the truth to tell.
Gisippus thought expedient.
That people knew what had befell.
Wherefore bye his own appointment.
For all the noble men he sent,
Home to his place of habitation,
Where Titus came for this intent,
In break his mind with an oration,
And after their good recreation,
He said to them, my dear friends all, The oration of Titus to (...)
Ath^^ensis.

Ye no^^^s of this famous nation,
A wondrrous thing declare I shall.
What is in Athenes now befall,
To your perpetual prick and praise*
Of love, whose power is mystical,
Wherefore he ought to take alwayse,
Great comfort fith in those your dayse,
Such love among you does remain,
As has been seen in no countrayse,
So well approuid with ease and pain.
For what more praise is their certain,
Then constance and benevolence.
Without who^ no kingdom may rain,
Uoyde of much inconvenience:
Where constance has the preminence,
The country is in much solace,
Through it they have always defense,
And comfort in each heavy case.
What need I tarry longer space,
In this contectinge mine intent,
You know from Rome unto this place
I was by my dear parantes sent.
And straight to Chremes house I went,
UUhere that I found by adventure,
Gisippus propre and prudent.
Of mine own age this is most sure.
We were so like of mood demure,
That none of his friends neither mine,
(It was so hard and so obscure,)
Could say to us (lo) this is thine,
But as we showed by sum sine,
Our personages to declare:
What mutual love eight years or nine,
Has been between us every where?
Ye your own selfs the witness are,
Which have beheld and seen us both,
This to affirm right well I dare,
Yet certainly I would be loath,
To speak such things should make you wroth,
But for my part by your license,
I will declare the very troth,
Desiring you of patience.
When that (by divine providence)
My father dyed who left to me,
Possessions such, that in expense,
Few with me might compared be,
Being eke of so high degree:
Also I being called home,
By my friends whom (right well know ye
Are of the noblest men in Rome.
And men also of ripe wisdom*
Offering me the highest dignitye:
But when they saw I would not come,
At their requests they maruayled why.
And wild my mother instantlye,
(To whose beck nature has me bent)
In her letters to certifye,
Me, that therbye I might relent.
Whose blotted bills with tears be spent,
Accusing me of unkindness,
For my being so long absent,
From her, since she is comfortles,
I say (in few words to express)
Could not withold or pull me back,
From Gisippus, although riches,
I was behest never to lack.
But liesier to be clothed with sack
I had, then part from such a friend,
For wordely wealth often winds to wrack,
But faithful friendship has none end,
I can not from his presence wend,
Except he thereto will agree:
As long as I have breath to spend,
His servant gladlye will I be:
Ye more gladly I promise ye,
Then of Rome to be the consul,
My love requited well has he,
In sauinge me from death so dull,
And of all other most painful,
No death that may be so cruel,
Though one were torn we bear or bull,
No paygnes more dreadful are in hell.
You merualle I perceive right well,
What person owth me such malice,
Or who dare be so ferse and fell,
To attempt such an enterprice,
(Reiectinge natures preindice)
Against me being a Romayne,
And of the noblest blod certice,
Who think ye the^ would me have slain:
I perceive ye would know full feign,
Who wrought me such cruel dispite,
It was love, yea, I tell you plain,
Which (as your Poets do resite)
Did wound your gods with loves delight, The description of the mighye pour of
love.

Made Jupiter chance his figure,
Like a bull or swan full white,
Or to sum other things obscure.
The same love which (I am full sure)
Made Hercules spin on a rock,
Sittinge among maidens demure,
Wearing next to his skin a smok,
And upon that a woman's frock,
Yea though he were so puissaunt,
That through his strength and sturdy strok,
He could slay Monstre and Giaunt.
The same love which made assemblaunt,
The Grecien lords in fields of Troy,
With Geldinges gay, and Glaues gallaunt
Which did the Traianes sore anoy
In ten years Greeks did them distroy,
And beat their city down to ground,
Perpetuallye ended their joy,
Their honor never shall resounde.
The same love I say did me wound,
Sodaynlye with such vehemence,
(Against whose assaults may be found,
No help (no comfort nor defense)
That in short space with violence
Of fervent tourmentes I had died,
Had not Gysippus resistance,
The band of my sorrow untied.
I se you would feign have discried,
Who I so loved: without delay,
With truth you shall be certyfied,
It is (I will it not denay)
Sophronia the lady gay,
Whom Gisippus had chose to wife,
And whom he loved I dare say,
As much as he did his own life.
But when he saw that Cupides knife,
Had hurt me with a healthles bloe,
Most friendly then, to end my strife,
Perceiving (as I trust you do.)
That gods provision wrought it so,
Through his divine almighty grace,
That she should be my wife, wheretoe
He gladly geuinge room and place.
True frendshyp he did more enbrace,
Then woman's love thereto forced,
And not constrained by Cupides mace,
(From whom no way is to be fled)
As I was, wherefore he granted
To me, his right in the damsel,
And even I Titus did her wed,
Her shamefastnes I did expel.
I lay with her, this mark ye well,
Confirminge the matrimony.
At those words they began to swell,
And looked most disdaynefullye,
Upon Gisippus by and bye.
Then Titus spoke to them saying,
Leave of your frettinge and furye,
Leave your spiteful menasinge.
Leave (I say) your murmuringe,
Leave of your grievous countenance,
For Gisippus has done nothing,
That shall be to your hinderaunce.
But your honor he does advance.
For well he knew, that he might find,
Another maiden that (perchance)
Might be more better to his mind.
But such a friend to him enclind,
Having respect to mine astate,
So like to him in every kind)
As I was, was not ventilate.
Also the maid does not abate,
Or take dispergement in her blood,
For (no dispraise to my dear mate)
Her marriage now is even as good.
And better if ye understood,
All that does to me appertain,
For I exceade her in liuelood,
And pass her in possessions plain.
The noblest men that does remain,
In Rome and in all Italye,
Did will mine alyaunce very vain,
Wherefore ye ought to magnify.
Gisippus, and be not auctrie
With him, but to exto (I say)
his kindness toward me, whereby
you, and your city safelye may
Be descended, and kept away:
I say he has well deserved,
A monument of gold so gaye,
To be set up and honored.
His love ought to be remembered,
For good that it may to you bring
But if you be not parswaded,
Devising any evil thing,
To him after my departinge,
I make auowe to the creature,
And maker of each thing living,
That with the invincible pour.
Of Romans, to your dishonor,
Perpetual reproach and blame,
I will resort for his socoure,
In such wise that your fatal fame,
Shall sound in all greece to your shame.
Therewith all them that were present,
Dessembled their malice with game,
As though they had been well content.
Sone after by the appoinctement,
Of all the Senators of Rome,
Titus was sent for to frequent,
An office fit for such a grome.
Then he prepared to go home,
But to depart it did him grieve,
From Gisippus, also to whom,
He granted gladly for to give,
Half of his substance to atcheue,
Only to have his company.
But Gisippus did well perceue,
How needful and necessary,
His counsel was to that city,
Wherefore he would not therhens wend,
Although above all things earthlye,
He ioyed in Titus his friend.
When Titus with his lady hend,
UUere gone to Rome for their repast,
Gysippus joys were at an end,
His friends and fellowship did wast.
His kinsmen spared not in have,
To exclude him from their counsel,
And did prohibit at the last,
That he should not in Athenes dwell.
And yet with this they were not well,
But (comptinge his love vain friendship)
From all his lands they did him expel,
Out of his robes they did him whipp,
And out of Athenes did him whippe,
Full poorly went Gisippus tho,
Having naught but a stasse and skrippe,
And needs a begginge must he go.
Gysippus wandringe to and fro,
Could find no man him to sustain,
This was his chance, alas for who
Necessitye did him constr^ine.
Thus late welthye he did remain,
And now banished his own countray,
Never must he come there again,
His kind heart brought him to that bay.
He wandered he wist not which way,
Lamentably still did he moan,
He knew no place where he might stay,
For hope of help he hears of none.
At last his pleasures past and gone,
To his great grefe, he remembered,
With Titus, for whom he alone,
Had all those damages suffered.
To go to Room he concluded,
His evil fortune to declare
To Titus, whom he supposed
Would for him sum redres prepare
So then with hunger cold and care.
To Room he ran, through mud and mire,
When he came thither pore and bare,
For Titus house he did enquire.
When he saw it, he did retire,
Because it seemed so princely,
He was ashamed to aspire,
Or in such raiment approach nie,
But stood that if Titus came by,
Himself he might to him present,
Thus thinking, he and his lady
Came walking forth incontinent.
Gisippus was so ragd and rent,
That when Titus did him behold,
He knew him not, but forth he went,
Not regarding his garments old.
Gisippus heart was then full cold.
Thinking that Titus did him hate,
Because no comfort show he would,
To him which stood so at his gate.
Then in a sorry simple state,
Gisippus thence away did trudge.
Cursinge his chance unfortunate.
Oh lord thought he, what man would judge
Titus to have been such a snudge,
For whom I suffer all this smart.
Gisippus thus at him did grudge,
Thinking for ever to depart.
From Room, and wander the desert
As a beast with madness possessed,
But yet he was well feign to start
(Being with werines oppressed)
Into an old barn to take rest:
Where he fallinge flat on the ground,
Drew out his knife and thought it best,
To give himself a deadly wound.
But wisdom did his will so drounde,
That from that act it did him keep.
Until he fell into a sound,
Or (as god would, as he did sleep)
Into a sad and slumbring sleep,
His knife wherewith he would have slain
himself, down by his side did stepe.
In the mean time a thief certain.
Which was a commen Ruffian plain:
And had both robbed and slain a man,
Thought in that barn for to remain,
To hide him self that night. But when
He saw a wretch bewept and wan.
On slep and a knife by his side,
He took the knife, and quicklye than,
Toward the dead man, he did glide.
Into his wound, both deep and wide,
(Which at that time did freshlye blede)
He put the knife thinkinge to hide,
His own vile act, and mischeuous deed,
And brought it all blodye with speed,
To poor Gysippus where he lay,
Aslepe, and put it (without dread)
Into his hand and went his way.
Sone after when that it was day,
The dead man being found: anon
The officers all in array,
Made earnest search for the felon,
And finding in the barn upon,
The ground, a man on sleep which ha^
A blody knife: suspection
They had, thinking him to be mad.
And waked him of his sleep so bad,
Saying arise thou murderarre,
With that Gysippus was right glad,
Thinking his death not to be far.
Before thy Senate to the bar,
They brought him to have his judgment
With bills and battes like men of war,
Yet he (poor soul) was innocent.
Titus at that time was present
Who beholding Gisippus well,
Lept from the bench incontinent.
And down upon his knees he fell
Saying give ear what I shall tell
Ye nobles all, and then discus,
This heinous murder so cruel
Committed was, by me Titus.
For old malice (the truth is thus)
Which I a long time did him owe,
For things that have been between us,
This stranger (as ye may well know,
Is desperate (god knows how)
And does this act gladly express
His care with death to overthrow,
Yet certainlye he is giltlesse:
Reward me for my wickedness,
For I it is that ought to dye.
Gisippus did again profes,
(Seeing Titus was contrary
To his aspecte) and still did cry.
To the Senators to proceade,
In sudgement on him bie and by,
For I said he have done the deed.
Titus denied it in that stead:
Thus they a long time did contend
Each of them for the others mede:
Who for thoffence should his life end,
Abundantlye tears they did spend,
The Senators abashed were,
None wist whereof it did depend,
That those two such friendship did bear.
The very these, bichaunce was there,
Amid the prease that time standinge,
Who when he heard with snob and tear
Those two persons thus disputinge.
Which both were giltles of the thing:
His heart could not make his tongue slake,
To keep truth from discoueringe,
Wherefore quite through ye prease he brak.
Before the Senate thus he spoke,
Most noble fathers every one, The confession of the these.

I am approached peace to make:
I am known to be a person.
Which have many bie theft undone,
Titus you know assuredlye,
Pleasure in malice he has none,
But is of much simplisitie:
This stranger eke which stands by,
Seems to be with care compact,
And disperate god knows why,
His wits from him being subtract:
They both are gilties of this act,
The truth plainly I will disclose,
I did that most ungracious fact,
The man from his life to depose.
I smot him that he never rose,
Then to the barn Iran full right,
Thinking to hide me from my foes:
But when I saw this woeful wight,
A sleep, thinking myself to quight
A policy I thought full good
I took his knife, and did it dight,
Both hafte and blade, in the man's blood.
When I had done, in that mad wood,
I brought his blodye knife again,
This feate my reason understood
Was best your judgment to refrain.
But concience now, does me constrayne,
To put the giltlesse out of dout,
At your iugdement, will I remain
Abiding death, though it be stout.
The Senate then and all the rout,
Rejoiced and took good comfort,
In all the court, there was a shout,
There never was a gladder sort,
To make the tale, more brefe and short,
Gysippus was, discovered,
Titus did their frendshippe report,
The felon, he was pardoned.
Titus being advertised
Of his most dear friends banishment,
He vowed to be avenged,
On Athenes yer long time were spent,
So then he took incontinent,
His friend Gysippus with him home,
Where that the lady excellent,
Most lovingly, bad him welcome.
His fame was spread throughout al Rome
With reverence, and with honor,
For his friendship, and his wisdom,
And for his lovely behauioure:
Titus being a Senatoure,
With assistince, he did prepare,
A mighty army to sucoure
His friend and to aduenge his care.
To Athenes ferslye he did fare,
With all his soldiers on a thronge,
On his friends foes he did not spare,
But with a courage stout and strong,
Requited al Gisippus wrong,
Restoringe him his goods certain
Stablishinge him, his friends among
And so returned to Room again.
