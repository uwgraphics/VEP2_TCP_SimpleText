A caroll of the birth of Christ
Come to Bethleem and ye shall se
Puer natus est hodie.
A woman a maid in thought and deed
A fayret with eyes might no man see
With her vgin paps her babe did feed
Puer natus est hodie.
The chyldes name is called Jesus
Gabryel said it should so be
Joy we together and sing we thus
Puer natus est hodie.
To make us rych, pore was he than
With mekenes and humylytie
Doutles he is both god and man
Puer natus est hodie.
Kings and princes of this did here
Together they came a maiden to see
Lullyng her babe her blessed son dear
Puer natus est hodie.
N^w blysful maid yt bare yt birth
Pr^^ ^hy son that we may him se
(...) (...) To every man that is unkind
what should I man do for the more
Than my life to be vntwynde
Thou art the fairest creatur^ to find
For I the made like unto me
And gave the reason, wit and mind
Quid vltra. etc.
I love the man above all thing
I will be borne for the therefore
Because I would to blys the bring
What shuldae I man do for the more
By Adams syn thou was forlore
Evermore punysshed for to be
But for thy mys I bought the sore
Quid vltra.
My hands (...) ^he cross be spread
To yield the mercy if thou wylt crau^
Mercy to ask be not adred
For if thou wylt I will the save
Wha^ thou art dead and laid in grave
And all thy friends from the flee
Yet thy soul will I have
Quid vltra. etc.
Finis.
(...) Blow ye wide still and blow not so shy^
My blood man I shed for the al at will
Blow ye wide still and blow not so shyll
This pain to suffer is my fathers will.
Sinful man thou art unkind
To thy maker yt made ye of nou^^^
Thou should keep and have in mi^de (...)
How with my blood I the boug^^
To save the from the pains of hell
That with the fend you should not dwell
Neither rather to go.
Blow the wind still.
This pain to suffer.
To a pillar bo^^^ both foot and hand
T^ll al my senew^ (...) broad did brast
Theiues me bet (...) they could stand
And as they weryed they did them rest
And arose a gain and scorged me so
Till blood and flesh went the bones fro
Blow the wind still.
This pain to suffer.
Wha^ they me scorged sharp and sure
They crowned m^ with a thorn
A read in my hand for a septure
And there they kneled me beforne
They said to me al hayle my king
For so was away their saying
And mo^ked me so
Blow the wind still:
This payue to suffer.
I bare ye cross that was so long
To Caluery where my death was dight
My mother followed with rufull song
Seeing my travel she fell down right
To se me in such pain I brought
For the syn man yt thou have wrought
She was full woe.
Blow the wind still.
This pains to suffer.
On the cross they splayed me than
And all my body they drew in bread
Till flesh and blod through ye skyn ran
My hands and fete with holes did blede
They went me fro with one assent
And made a knight my heart to rent
Thus payned they me tho
Blow the wind still
This pain to suffer.
They gave me drink yt was not fine
The which was eysell myxte with gall
They gave it me instead of wine
And I said than made an end was al
Than went away my spirit to hell
To fetch the souls yt there did dwell
And in Limbo lay.
Blow the wind still
This pain to suffer.
Finis.
Farewell aduent and have good day Chrystmas is come, now go thy way.
GEt the hence what do thou here
Thou have no love of no beggere
Thou make us fast with evil chere
With farewell aduent.
Thou take on ye more tha^ does ye lent
Theu dwell so long that you art shent
When alleluya is a lofte
I go gay and sit soft
And than I am merry often
As any bird on brere
When laus tibi comes to town
Than me behooves to knele down
And ever to be in orisowne
As it were a friar.
Soon at Easter comes alleluya
With butter chese and a tansay
It is nothing to my pay
That he taryeth away so long
Might I bide shere thursday
Laus tibi shall go away
^d I have wept that I may
Though he never come us among
Finis.
In the honor of Christ's birth
Sing we al with joy and myrthe.

IN this time of Chrystmas
Bytwyxte an ox and an ass
A maiden delivered was
Of Christ her dear son dear
^ The husband of Mary
Joseph stood her by
And said he was ready
To serve her if need were.
When she her dear son se
She set him on her kne
And song hydder to me.
Cum basse thy mother dear*
* On her lap she him laid
And with her pappe he playde
And ever sang the maid
Come basse thy mother dear.
With lyppes collyng
His mouth often she did kiss
And fayd sweet heart mine
I pray you make good chere.
To this child let us pray
That borne was on this day
Of Mary the mylde may
To grant us all good chere.
Finis.
