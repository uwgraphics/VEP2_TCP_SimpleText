Here begins a little treatise in English / called the Extripacion of
ignorancy: and it treats and speaks of the ignorance of people / showing
them how they are bound to fear god / to love god / and to honor their
prince. Which treatise is lately compyled by sir Paul Busshe priest / and
Bonhome of Edyndon: and dedicate unto the young and most hye renomed lady Mary /
princes and daughter unto the noble progenytour / our worthy sovereign king
Henry the eight / king of England and of France / and hye defe^der of ye
christenfaithe. etc.



(...) Hystoris to read / autentycall and true
Grace to augment / and ydelnesse to subdewe.
Wherefore gracious lady / sithe ye are so prone
By natural instyncte / and humble humylite
Thus virtuously to be occupied / no hour forgone
Of your mylde goodness / my dytties to ouerse
Wherein ye shall find / touched in breuyte
Hystoris autentycall / of the testament old
And some presyde^ces of ye new / necessary to behold
And though I lack dropes / of ye lycour laureate
Which sprang of Chaucer / ye fou^tayne of orators
To adorn my style and my matter to consecrate
yet gracious princes / to repel the sharpeshours
Of synistrall reports / among yuell detractours
Sometime at leysar / your other charges laid aside
Where ye fault find / correct or it be spyde.
Thus doing / your grace shall me straightly bind
With heart and service / to do what lies in me
your magnifyce^ce to extol / or else I were unkind
According to your merytes / to testify my fydelyte
Against you and your pare^tes / whose wealth and dignite
Christ conserve / and also daily augment
with honor and worship / co^grue / to your power exelle^t.
The prologue general of Paul Busshe / composytour of this little treatise.
Deum timete / et regem honorificate. Prima Petri secundi.
In an orcharde as I walked / desolate of company
In a pathe / from tree to tree / as my usage was
Vnbrede with bows pendau^t / in order plesauntly
In mind I reuolued / how I might bring to pass
Some treatise to endyte / to the conforte and solace
Of people desirous / virtuously to be occupied
To se god lauded / and his hye name magnifyed.
And as I walked alone / in mind thus musyng
I thought to endyte / what thing were necessary
And by long delyberacion / I co^iectred most sytti^g
Somewhat to write / of man's ingratytude and folly
And to prosecute his demeaner / all crooked and contrary
To god his maker / by lyueng not commendable
Subdued by vice / and such matters semblable.
And no great marueyle / ne wonder certain
Though such inco^uenyence / enshewe us among
For wylfully is broken / the bridell and the rain
Which should govern man in every thronge
As first / dread is expulsed / by audacite strong
And sensualyte rules / as governor principal
So that Christ is not dradde / ne feared at all.
Also perfyte love / which should devout minds
Set on fire / in loving god omnypotent
Is subpeditate / by enormytes of sondrie kinds
Wherefore I thought it semyng / and most co^uenye^t
As touching my purpose / for this time present
Of these two matters / and their circu^stau^ce chefely
Somewhat to write / to mittygate such folly.
And also to speak / I thought it expedient
Thirdly of ignorance / which ledeth people froward
Showing them by auctorites / and reasons euydent
How they are oblygate / in especial regard
Their prince to honor / as capten of their forward
Whose magnanimyte / they ought to auaunce
With hertes and goods / after their substance.
Of these matters three / as god will dispose
I entende this volume / shall bear thimportaunce
And as breuely / as I can / in meter compose
I shall discribe as my wits can forge vttraunce
Their grades and disti^ctions / their propertis and eligau^ce
Rebukyng in especial / wylfull rash audacite
and also blind ingratitude / which man ought to fle.
That gostly champion / saint Peter the apostell
In his epistels / this sentence often does resight
Fear you god he says / this is his counsel
And look ye honor your prince / with power and might
In his just tytell / always ready for to fight
Thus shall you please god / and your souls decorate
When ye heed with the me^bres / togider be adunate.
What causes mischefe? what causes disce^cion?
Discord and debate: But only disobedience
Thus old hystores and scripture / makes mention
For it is counted a life brutall / ever says sapience
When that people lyueng / does not their dilyge^ce
God chefly to worship / and their prince to honor
As the thing special / of their corporal treasour.
What caused cities and towns to fall to ruin:
But only the decayeng / of Christ's hye honor
When ye people to vice / them self did fully enclyne
Sometime the Romans / habounded in treasour
But when christ's honor decayed / and they fell to error
Than their renome abated / urged by violence
For their unstable demeaner / to keep true silence.
Many fold presyde^tes / reduce we may to memory
Cotidially showed of man's unstable dotage
Waueryng as the wind / laboring right busely
For honor and worship / as one of hye lynage
Clyming so hye / that forgoten is their parentage
ye / god and his prince / and himself also
Which after subuerteth his state / to sorrow and woe.
Well this set clean aside / I shall my wits auau^ce
My purpose to comprice / and thereto my pen direct
No lengar to remain / by gods governance
In matters dependyng / nothing to theffecte
Eschewing words superflewe / which often does infect
The sentence clear / of hystores true and autentycall
Left for moral presydentes / to people universal.
But in mind when I pondre / this proverb old
Who casts less peryls / tha^ does bayarde blind
It makes my hand quake / and also my heart cold
And tosseth my wits / as a ship before the wind
Lest some froward persons / pervert and unkind
Should by me report / words somewhat equalent
Saying / to entprice such causes / he is insufficie^t.
Such sayi^g may be verified ye deed makes relacio^
Wherefore to my masters / knowng the quiditice
Of scolasticall acts / by practyse and speculacion
I submyt my self / in most humble wise
Their due correction / in no case to dispyce
But as a discyple / leanyng to doctrine
So unto their tradicions / gladly I shall enclyne.
But the correction I refuce / and that in especial
Of a wandering mynstrell / or of a rusty coke
Of a iester / a rayler: or of a barbaryke rural
Or of any such other / knowing no letter in book
The truth to say / not an A / from a fysshe hoke
And after mine opinyon / it is greatly vnsyttyng
That such should have / such matters in ha^dlyng.
But yet though such chatte / as does the Pie
And find many fautes / for lack of intellection
yet that shall not cause me to omyt my study
But to keep ydelnesse / in bond and subjection
Such pastyme will I use / under the protection
And the divine suffrau^ce / of god omnypotent
As to my state / is most syttyng and conuenyent.
Co^mendacion it is none / this I know certain
A relygious man / to ydelnesse to be obedyent
Nor the laud is but small / vile and mundayne
His time to co^tryue / in discribing works insolent
For to such things / if he do his mind frequent
Wysemen shall say / deprauyng his fame
This man gothe about / to lose his good name.
Therefore my lords and masters in general
Pondre the intent / of my enterprise rude
For the thing y^ provoked me / to this work special
My study to apply / with dilygent solycitude
Was that slothful idelnesse / should not me illude
And yt I may acco^plysshe / my purpose and intent
First shall I pray / as it is most expedient.
Now lord / as thy sapience surmou^teth ma^s estimacion
In rulyng and gouernyng / by providence incomparable
Heuyn / earth / and hell / as doctors make relacion
So now rule my pen / and my wit variable
That my work be not found / fauty ne yet culpable
But fartell of goodness / garnysshed with virtue
Vice utterly to repel / and gostly fortitude to renew.
Also help me lord / of thy goodness habu^dau^t
Directly to proceed / in this matter compendyous
My style to adorn / with sentence plesaunt
That to the reders / gredy and desirous
It may be profitable / and also commodious
Their hertes to inflame / always pondring
God to dread / and to honor their king.
Thus ends the prologue of Paul Busshe / co^positour of this work / and
begins the first treatise / which speaks of the dread and fear that every
man ought to have to offe^de almighty god. Venite filij audite me, timorem
domini docebo uos. Psalmo. xxxiij

AS ornaments fresh / plesaunt and comely
Garnisheth ye body / of man woman and child
So is ye soul decorate / when people labor busely
God specially to honor / by conversation vndefylde
Whose power inui^cible / chasteth and tameth ye wild
As hunger does the faucon / all at large flyeng
Wherefore attend my words and pondre my saying.
Deum timete.

He that purposes / graciously to comprehend
The joys inestymable and with god to reign
Must remember pondre and well attend
That he have sure in store / wings twain
The one must be dread / the other love certain
And these two well ordered / fear not thy departing
Wherefore attend my words and pondre my saying.
Deum timete / et diligite.

Dauyd the prophet / does pronostike this sentence
In his book of psalms / as plainly does appear
That the original only / of all wisdom and sapience
Is to dread god / and also his power to fear
For it is not good / man him self to endanger
With his true justice / and most rightuous dealyng
Wherefore attend my words and pondre my saying.
Deum timete.

If Adam our first parent / being in paradise
Had humbly obeyed / the commandment special
Of god his maker / the myrrour of all justice
And not wylfully tra^sgressed / by suggestio^ mortal
But always have feared / his displeasure pri^cipall
Than changed had not be^ his state in wealth flowi^g
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
When the world also / was replete with sin
Almost every creature / prone to vnthriftynesse
Was not Noe preserved / and eight of his kynne
From dredefull drownyng / for his constant sadness
And life right commendable: as bears witness
The history true: without color of faynyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Deum timete.

Old Abraham ye patriarch / has made i^molacyon
Offryng his son ysaac / in sacrifice most redolent
Had he not feared / gods just castygacion
No doutlesse / the history shows plain and evident
For it was always / his mind and intent
Gods will to acco^plysshe / as it is most syttyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Deum timete.

Was not virtuous Jacob / had i^ worthy reputacion
With almighty god / and endewed with great substance
Ruling nere the world / as writi^g makes relacion
By his pruident dealyng / and polytike governance
And all this was provided / by gods ordinance
For his moral lyueng / and rightuous demeanyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Deum timete.

Also what abled Joseph / to such hye authorite
As to be lord and governor / of Egypt that region
Was it not his virtue / and sober grauyte
Dredyng the enfecte / his soul with the poison
Of Venus flaming lusts / fylthy as carrion
Behold well genesis / there appears the writing
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
What auaunced Moises / sometime a shepherde
To honor and fame / as man of hye parentage
But only that his lord / he dradde and feared
Instructi^g his people / committed to his gouernage
With la^gage discrete / cou^tinau^ce / demure and sage
The fame special to enshewe / vice and syn avoiding
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum timete.

Why was Iosue elect / by god omnypotent
Moses to succeed / in office and dignyte
But that he feared god / and eschewed works insole^t
As it becomes a captain / set in auctorite
For hye roumes / and dissolute manners / as we se
Full ill does acorde / as iugeth wisdom and co^nyng
Wherefore attend my words and pondre my saying.
Deum timete.

Were not ye children of israll plo^ged in care and sorrow
In the time of Aioth / Delbora and Gedeon
As in captiuyte to day / and at lyberte to morrow
Now in now out / brought to great confusyon
And all for their iniquite / and unstable co^uersacion
God not dredyng / but all at pleasure wandering
Wherefore attend my words and pondre my saying.
Deum timete.

O holy Ruth / a woman though thou were
And made of nature frail / as all women be
yet example art thou / as plainly does appear
To all men / for thy meekness and hye humylite
For in the reigned / no such mutabylite
But virtue and goodness / god always fearyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
If Ofnye and Phynes / the sons of Hely
Had feared god / and not preuaricate his intent
Ne defrauded their father / and the people chefely
Which made oblacion / with minds beniuolent
Than suffered they had not / such strait punyshme^t
As to be slain both / the holy arc also lesyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum timete.

How garnysshed Samuel / his life leuiticall
With works meritorious / as a lamp and luminary
Rulyng all Israel / in causes judicial
With justice and equite / by his wit and policy
Subduyng transgressors / myttigatyng folly
Feryng gods punisshment / as I said at begi^ni^g
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum timete.

Did not David commit a syn great and detestable
When that Vrye his seeuau^t / he caused to be slain

Co^mytting auoutry / as thistory shows plain

He did penance / gods punysshment fearyng

wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Why was Eliseus ye prophet / endued with such virtue
As to restore the deed to life again

For time perpetual / in turment always lyeng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum timete.

What caused Nabugodonosor / a king of great fame
To fall from his regal state / to lead a life brutall
Lyueng by hey and grass / in woeful misery and shame
But only his errogance / not fearing god eternal
Which by his might / subdueth such people fro^tall
Wandering at pleasure as the wind waueryng
Wherefore attend my words and pondre my saying.
Deum timete.

When people be enflamed / with blind ambiciosite
Couetyng hye gouernage / unworthy and unable

Thus says the theologe / plain in his writing
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum timete.

What mention makes / that book so exellent
Paralipomynon / which treats seriously
Of kings and princes / and of their regyment
Showing how some were auaunced to glory
For their lives venerable / dispisyng pleasures tra^sitorie
Dreding always: the final day of recuyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying

Their lives so to lead / brought to extreme ruin

O holy dread / how surely thou were planted
In the heart of Toby / that gostly lyueng person

Of theft and rapyne / the sequel thereof dredyng

If Isaye / Heremye / Baruthe / and Ezechiell

What was ye origynall / yt caused the macabeis five
As valiant men / descended of stock royal
In marciall business / their lives to contryue

Feared sore to break / their laws moisecall
Is doutlesse / thus says plain the writing
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying

Many thousands mo / there be without dout

Whose names and acts / I purpose to omyt chefly
Because I entende to write now consequently
Of our new patrons / the merits also praising
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Deum timete.

First what caused the holy apostels all
This world to dispyce / caduke and transitory
Affectyng no honors / ne pleasurs corporal
Certain it was / as the text does testify
For fear of lesyng / the everlasting glory
Of heavenly joy sovereign / excellyng all thing
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
O blesshed Paul / dyddest not thou also
Fervently labor / with traueyle and great pain
To preche and teache / where ever thou dyddest go
And all because / that thou would obtain
The joys inestymable / and with god to reign
yes surely: this was thy special recuyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Deum timete.

At first beginning / you were enflamed greatly
With furious audacite / procuring only to abate
Christ's hye honor his disciples pursuing namely
But thy tyra^nous courage / was son subpeditate
When thou laist nuslyng / on the ground prostrate
In the field of Damasse / for mercy always crieng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Deum timete.

What caused Steven and Laurence / with diverse other
As vi^cent albane / and thom^s: these martyrs glorious
Also Cyrike the enfant with Iulyta his mother
Constantly to parseuer / in turmentes dolorous
Was it not for fear of lesyng / the ma^cion glorious
yes doutlesse / or else in vain was their traueyling
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Deum timete.

How many holy co^fessors / do we find in likewise
As we read in legendes / left in perpetual memory
Which daily mortifyde / as plants of paradyce
Their members corporal / asswaging lusts filthy
Feryng the co^tamynate / the figure of endless glory
Of these we find thousa^des / without any fayning
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Also what is he / which truly can express
The no^bre of perfyte virgyns / pure and immaculate
Which lived here co^tynent / grounded in soberness
In whose honors now / our temples are dedycate
I know certain / if I should daily inuestigate
yet should I never bring them all to recuyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum timete.

This still to replycate / hystores autentycall
Time it consumes / wherefore to conclude
That I say to one / I say breuely to all
If ye will obtain / the everlasting beatytude
Beware of ignorance / and blind ingratytude
And evermore among / as I said at beginning
Attend my frequent words / and pondre my saying.
Here ends the first part of this volume / which has showed how man is
bound to fear god by manyfolde examples. And now immediately here follows
the second part / which shall speak of ye love that man ought to have to
almighty god.
Diligamus nos deum / quoniam deus prior dilexit nos. Prima Iohannis quarto.
Read the last word in the second line over the leaf / merytorious / for
metorious.
Deum diligite.

But yet god thus to dread / and nothing to love
It were but labor tedious / and scant metorious
For he that a place will purchase above
Eternally to reign / in state most prosperous
Must combyne dread / with love ardent and amorou^
As two things necessary / to one belongyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Deum diligite.

This love is so noble / so hye and so exellent
If it be pure voluntary / fre and spontayne
That to all virtues / it is a spectacle euydent
For another dread / nor yet obedience certain
May be acceptable unto god / this is plain
Except love be the origynall / and the well spring
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Deum diligite.

The love that Christ showed first for man
In his plasmacion / by gifts hye and excellent
Was for no qualyteis / that in him reigned than
His production was so baren / yet of his mind provident
To magnify our nature / it was his intent
For of all his creatures / he made man lord and king
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Deum diligite.

Whereof mounted this gift of preemynence
But only of his mere love / as I said before
Not in vain to betaken / through our negligence
But as a presydent / always to be had in store
Love to encrese and augme^t / specially again therefore
This may we understand / by reason rulyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
The multitude of benefits / should enge^dre amyte
Namely when they be exibite / to people indigent
Wrapped in wretchedness / and bonds of calamite
As is our nature / all lame and impotent
By necessite inevitable / of it self not sufficient
But that god mynistreth / unto us all thing
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum diligite.

Such is our necessyte / that no creature can say
Without the exellent gifts / of god omnypotent
I am able to live / one natural day
No doutlesse / to speak / and to be indifferent
Be he never so noble / not the space of a moment
So feeble and so sklender / is our substance wavering
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum diligite.

Let us consydre / how prone in times all
Christ is to sufflute / our impotence and debilyte
For our necessite / is not so urgent at all
But much more prone / is his aid and benignyte
All seasons helpyng / our care and aduersite
Gyueng us life / conseruyng our being
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Deum diligite.

This is euydent / experience does ye cause patify
That his conseruacion / may not be sequestrate
From our substance caduke / vile and transitory
For if it be / we all are but frustrate
Redacte to adnichilacion / from all thing private
Of shape and form / nothing remaining
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
These consyderacions / ought to auaunce reason
With solicitude of mind / concludyng finally
That man is most bound / having discrecion
God always to laud / with seruage and study
Inuestigate who lists / he fyndeth not the contrary
For this yeldeth reason / without more recuyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum diligite.

Now / sith man is bound / above creatures all
To god omnypotent / for his benefits infynite
He ought to reuolue / in his mind principal
What thing may be / most acceptable in his sight
And the same to render / with heart and might
Or else reason may reprove / his unworthy dealyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum diligite.

What thing may be / thinks man in mind
Unto god his maker / more plesaunt or acceptable
Than to show him love / as reason does him bind
Doutlesse nothing / so precious nor commendable
Nor to us nothing / so necessary nor profitable
If it be depured / from all erthely recuyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum diligite.

This love must be pure ta^gled with no wealth mu^dain
But fixte on him only / which of naught made all
Or else inordinate is our law / this is plain
For when love is wrapped / with affection carnal
It is not good nor godly / but beestly and brutall
And to people reasonable / greatly discordyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
What should man / having the use of discrecion
Fix his mind / on things vain and transitory
Though nature give beauty / and fair impression
Set not thy mind / on such matters rasly
For it is but volage / and changed shall be shortly
To all creaturrs: this chief point is belongyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum diligite.

It is greatly uncomely / unto us people mortal
To set our hertes on that / which can not remain
For he that is prudent / to mind often will call
That such faint follyes / should not him co^straine
His maker to forget / for things abiecte and vain
But labor he should busely / for his soul providing
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum diligite.

What can the world promise to the perpetually
Sith nothing it has / that is perdurable
But fraite with vanitees / cowarde under pall
Thy mind to enuolue / with thoughts damnable
And thy soul to put / to pains intermynable
This ever eschewyng / thy life mysgouernyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum diligite.

Such doleful rewards / among people prudent
Are utterly dispysed / and set at naught
Reuoluyng in mind / this proverb often frequent
The child is ill taught / and worse up brought
Which in age / has no mind nor thought
His body to refrain / from in ordynate lyueng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
God made not man / as doctors make relacion
His wits five / to spend mordynate
But his part were / his life and conversation
So to govern and adorn / with no abusyon violate
That with joy and felycite / his soul might be decorate
In the stage glorious / all thing surmountyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum diligite.

A heart with devotion flamed / will covet always
The thing special / which is pure and co^staunt
And that only desire: both night and day
Which is good and honest / and to god pleasant
Deformed with no enormyte / to his state repugnant
His laud so hyndring / and his good name depraui^g
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum diligite.

Man ought to desire / the thing most emynent
Sure and not fadyng / which all time does profit
Drowned with no error / void of all turment
As endless bliss / incomparable and perfyte
Which every good man / does desire and couyte
His carcas dispisyng / for such treasour sekyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum diligite.

This endless bliss certain / is of such valor
That it is impreciable / no man can it bye
With gold ne silver / richesse nor yet treasour
It excels so in honor / in beauty and glory
And ordained it is / no man can deny
For god and his angels / and man well lyueng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
The apostell Paul / in his epystles does say
That no heart can think / nor material eyese
No ear can here / nor tongue express may
The inestymable glory / joy and felycite
That is comprised / without fastidiosyte
In this realm of pleasure / in beauty shinyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Deum diligite.

In this court angely call / reigns no mortalyte
No need nor indigence / but plente and habu^dau^ce

May enter this trone / of Christ's garnysshyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.

Salomans sapience / that surmounted so hye
Nor Absalons beauty / ye was praised in especial
Is not to be compared / in laud and glory
To the wisdom and beauty / which perpetual
In this stage and trone / clerer than cristall
Gloriously adorned / things all excellyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Deum diligite.

The fortitude of Sa^pson / nor the velocite of Asael
As scripture shows / in sentence most worthy
Nor yet the long life / of the ancient Matusaell
Were but gifts natural / enuolued with misery
Nothing to be resembled / to the goodness heavenly
which in this glorious habitacle is ever abydyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
And all this man / you may purchase and obtain
By virtuous lyueng / and by love true and perfyght
Loving thy maker / yt has ordained the to reign
Thus for time perpetual / in his presence and sight
In his trone everlasting / never destitute of light
But garnisshed with beauty / in virtue shyning
wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Here ends the second perte of this volume / which has showed / how man
is bound to love almighty god: (...) potestatibus sublimioribus subdita sit,
quia non est potestas ^usi a deo. Ad ^oma. (...)
And now here after follows ye third part / which shall speak of the
honor that every man is bound to reuerente his prince and sovereign with all.
Now seeing that I / have made demonstracion
In style homly / thy love how you should bestow
To gods pleasure man / and thy souls co^seruacion
Now breuely to reuert / I purpose to show
How that thy prince / thou ought to know
That to god may be acceptable / thy lyueng
wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Regem honorificate.

By moral wisdom / first devised were
Officers and governors / of constant grauyte
This world namely to rule / and set in an ordere
With comely manners / eschewyng all enormyte
Adornyng their own lives / mortifyeng vanyte
To people rude / virtuous examples gyueng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Of these governors / which ruled thus long space
Some were patryarkes / prophets: and iuges te^perall
And so^e were prestes discrete / and as thistory do trace
Descended lyneally / of the styrpe and stock leuiticall
And again some were scribes / ingenious and moral
By polytike discrecion / their offices gouernyng
wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Prepositos honorificate.

When these worthy governors / armed with prudence
Had governed thus the world / a long time and date
It was thought more co^uenyent / for ye co^me^s defense
One heed and ruler / to govern and the principate
therefore as people discrete / in one mind co^federat
They chose the^ a ruler / and named him a king
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Regem honorificate.

This king our sovereign / we ought to honor
And have in reputacio^ / as the myrrour of chiualry
In whose magnanimite / rests our trust and tresour
All times and seasons / to suffult our bale and misery
As a capten valeaunt / rulyng by wit and policy
His subjects transgressors / straightly punisshyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Regem honorificate.

Who makes our enemies to dread and fear
Insurrections to make / our welthe to molest
Who punissheth the felone / who corrects murder
Who keeps our noble realm in peace and rest
Who makes ye prone lecher / to be good and honest
Does not this our sovereign and worthy king
Wherefore attend my words and pondre my saying.
Who causes justice / who causes equite:
Duly to be mynistred / in city / borowe / and town.
Who quenches the flames / of rasshe lassyuite
Who exalts just lyuers / and the wicked puts down
All this does our prince / beryng ye cepter and crown
In whose hand rests / our wealth and gouernyng
Wherefore attend my words and pondre my saying.
Regem honorificate.

If our prince were not / order were there none
For every (...) would rule / and play the lord
And than should ye poreman both grudge and groan
Kept under bondage / as dog under board
And not so hardy / as ones to speak a word
For dread of punisshment / and of his goods lesyng
Wherefore attend my words and pondre my saying.
Regem honorificate.

Where is no heed / the body deformed is
Far out of shappe / as we se by experyence
So in caselike / thou can not contrary this
Where is no sovereign / there reigns inco^uenye^ce
As fraud / gyle / and extorcio^ / with many other offense
So that all togiders / ro^neth to the devil hedlyng
wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Regem honorificate.

Were it not for fear / of our prince and sovereign
I think surely / and dare boldly say
Verite nor yet equite / should be suffered to reign
And than soon after / should our realm decay
So craftily would avarice / her matters convey
Through subtylte / her ha^dmaydes help and socori^g
Wherefore attend my words and pondre my saying.
Al syses and sessyons / much perjury is used
Falls heed and power / be so nigh of consanguinite
But tha^ our worthy prince / which ca^ not be deluded
By his law and justice / extirpeth such percialyte
Thus it is doutlesse / or else thus it should be
In every realm and region / where reigns a king
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Regem honorificate.

Would our masters trow ye / both spu^all and te^perall
Fear as they do: their lives to contamynate
With manners uncomely / by suggestions infernal
Hyndring their honor / and hurtyng their estate
were it not for their prince / to who^ they be subiugate
Doutlesse no: The more pytie without fayning
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Regem honorificate.

Reason would be so blinded / by ambicion verily
Were it not for dread of our prince and sovereign
that by simony execrable / holy churches patrimoni
Should be bought and sold / as it is known plain
More common than the ox / vile and mundayne
Which is sold in markettes / for great wynning
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Regem honorificate.

Here may you aduert man / what profits does ensue
To the realm and subjects / of every region
Where as valiant princes / do correct and subdue
Such fro^tall enormytes / by their laws correction
No state favoring / if he worthy be punissyon
But every man to reward / after his deseruyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
When prices be perciall / and not to all indifferent
It gives people occasion / to grudge and complain
But when they minister to all like punysshment
Than in their realms / most commonly do reign
Peace / unity / and concord / without disdain
So that every man ioyeth / of others well lyueng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Regem honorificate.

O / what treasour it is / and synguler aueyle
When princes be given / to virtue and goodness
Their own fautes to behold / and them to bewail
Their souls to redeem / out of wretchedness
This point most chefely / belongs doutlesse
To every good prince / endless pains reuoluyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Regem honorificate.

The next point also / that a prince valiant
Ought to bear in mind / both i^ welthe and distress
Is to be always lyberall / and in his deeds co^stau^t
His pore co^mens to love / and the^ never to oppress
Except necessite do instant / his noble worthynesse
Aid to require / for his just tytles defendyng
Wherefore attend my words and pondre my saying.
Regem honorificate.

In such causes man: thou art bound to socour
Thy prince and sovereign / with goods and substance
Which thy body also / and with thy worldly treasour
His right to mentayne / and his honor to auaunce
Whereby thy welthe / with good perseueraunce
Shall prospere the better / for thy true dealyng
wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
To this chrisst gave us / as we read in the gospel
Example most euydent / when he comau^ded Peter
To the sea to go / as Mathe we does us tell
Saying: in ye fisshes mouth / find he should there
A piece of money / which duly he should deliver
For their subsedy / to their emperor and king
Wherefore attend my words and pondre my saying.
Regem honorificate.

The same also affirms / the postell and doctor
Blessed saint Paul / in his epistell which he sent
To the romans / which he brought out of error
Saying: look yt to prices / shinyng i^ power emine^t
ye be always subject / meke / low / and obedyent
Ready them to aid / at all times calling
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Regem honorificate.

Likewise says Peter / as the text lies plain
In his first epistell / and in the second chapitour
Look that ye be dilygent / says he / ready and feign
Like humble subjects / your princes to honor
With faithful hertes / with goods and treasour
And so please you shall / our everlasting king
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Regem honorificate.

And all though says he / that in lyueng and behauour
All princes and souerayns / be not like of condition
But some rigorous and vicyous / enuolued in error
yet not withstandyng / your purpose and chief ente^cion
Must be to obey / for your dew correction
Such unworthy rulers / sent for your mislyueng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
In many places else / inscripture I find
And in the law also / allegacions autentycall
Which does the command man / and straightly bind
Thy prince to honor / under statutes penal
Which if thou break / thou do surely fall
In the censours eccliasticall / and danger of the king
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Regem honorificate.

Now conclude upon this / and thy courage auaunce
And think that it is not / the regal power only
Which price have i^ gouernage / to speak i^ substance
That to such obedience / byndeth the thus straightly
But it is certain / as se thou may plain
The state legal / of the churches first ordring
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Regem honorificate.

Behold what inco^uenie^ce / commonly does ensue
Where reigns inobediente / debate and disce^cion
Behold also again / where people be untrue
How their of springes / be put under subjection
To day a lord / and a man of great possession
And to morrow scant worth / a poor sely fardyng
Wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying
Regem honorificate.

Likewise behold / what utterly destruction
Has comen of rebellyon / and wylfull conspiracy
Is it not plainly left in description
How by such means / monasteries right worthy
Has been distroyed / and contaminate uncomely
yet doutlesse: it appears plain in writing
wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Also / how many noble cities / castles / and towers
Has been subverted / and made ways plain
By violent force / and marciall showers
The goods dispoyled / the governors slain
Their wives and daughters / defloured certain
This for rebellion / has been seen without fayning
wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Regem honorificate.

Such lamentable conflictes / and mortal dolours
Are spectacles necessary / sometime to behold
To stable men's minds / avoiding dishonours
And to live in peace / which a thousand fold
Is treasour more precious / than silver or gold
As man may judge / by his own wit reuoluyng
wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Regem honorificate.

O noble England / O worthy realm of fame
Note well these presydentes / and bear the^ in mind
And be true to thy prince / co^tynuing thy good name
For in chronicles / yet could I never find
That to thy worthy souerayn / thou were unkind
Which to ye is great laud / and also to god praysinge
wherefore attend my words / and pondre my saying.
Regem honorificate.

Now thus to conclude / without more prolixite
I purpose by gods grace / and no lengar to tarry
Repeting these foresaid words / togider as they be
Fear you god / love you god / and also finally:
Honor your prince / myrrour of all chiualry
And so shall ye purchase / joy without endyng
The which god grant us all / at our departing.
Here follows a brefe conclusyon of Paul Busshe / composytour of this work /
to the reders of the same.
How have ye little book / god be thy good speed
And look that thy self / thou mekely present
Among my masters all / requyring no mede
No laud / ne praising / for that was not thentent
Of thy compositour / as knows god omnypotent
But his purpose was / people chefely to excyte
In virtuous pastyme / to have some delight.
Some have pleasure / in the feldes to walk
Of ye stillyng of therth / to take ye fragrant odours
Some delyteth again / to bide at home and talk
In redyng chronicles / of their ancient progenytours
How worthily they optayned / glory and honors
And some again there be / and they desire chefely
Of musical instruments / to here ye sweet armony.
All these be pastymes / right honest and venerable
To reprove them greatly / we have none occasyon
For all thing that is done / after manner laudable
May be permytted / in the way of recreacyon
So that it be done / with demure conuersacyon
Hurtyng no man / always obseruyng measure
Which is thing commendable / in every gesture.
But some villayns there be refrayni^g no shame
Dispyce all pastymes / honest and moral
Uncleanly thoughts / does them so inflame
That their hertes and minds / beset in especial
In redyng of books and balades / of acts veneryall
Thinki^g in their opinions / nothing more laudable
Which is right vile / full wretched and damnable.
How should I than / after this wise and rate
Please and content / such minds unstable
It were greatly vnsyttyng / unto my order and state
If I should endyte / such matters (...) commendable
This wysmen will say / though ye fool with his babble
Think no works good / except they in special
Smacke of Venus lusts / filthy and brutall.
But let such think / and say what they please
To say that I will contryue / my time and study
About such business / almighty god to displease
Doutles I purpose not / wherefore my self to occupy
In works commendable / I did my mind apply
This little brefe process / thus rudely to endight
Some things thereby / to bring to light.
Therefore my worthy lords / and master ingen^all
Over read this little volume / sometime at leysour
And if it be well / give lauds chief and principal
To god omnypotent / our lord and savior
And if it be otherwise / let me bear the dishonor
For well am I worthy / as I said at beginning
For entprisyng this cause / having so little co^ning.
Thus ends this book / entytuled or called ye extyrpacion of ignorancy.
Imprinted (...) in fletestrete by Richard (...) to the kings most nob^^ (...)
