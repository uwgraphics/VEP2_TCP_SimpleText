THE PREFACE TO THE READER.
EXPERIENCE has made the case clear, in all sciences, arts, and professions,
wherein humane capacity does show the souls excellency, in apprehension,
discourse, and judgment of things past, present, or to come, by invention,
moral conjecture, and wit of man: that these five Rules hold out as
inexpugnable Principles, The Author in all these five Principles and
certainties of things, of none denied, does clearly convince the Jesuits
faction and all their fautours of many gross errors: which ignorant people
deduct from their absurd rules, opposite to these in all things: as that their
General with his company of Prouincials, cannot err: that they cannot fail
in their doctrine, instructions, government, and the like: that the foundation
of their order is a state of most perfection of any other, etc. All which
errors, with many other are impugned by these five grounds set down, as in a
Preface to the particular Quodlibets here following.
affirmed of all, and denied of none: to wit. First, that no ground in
Divinity, no Axiom in Philosophy, no Maxim in the Law, no Paragraffe in
positive Discourse, no Paradoxe amongst Orators, no Proposition amongst
Schoolmen, no Article of our faith amongst Apostles by sacred OEcumenicall
Synod, defined, deposed, and decided to be thus and none otherwise believed,
and taken under pain of damnation: but the same may be impugned by a seeming
reasonable plea to the contrary, with arguments of proof in show holden on a
whole day by fine wits, in a school despicion: and the defendant so grauelled
(if of dull and slow conceit) that he shall have no reason to deny that to be
true: (as verbi gratia: that black is white: that a man is a mouse: that there
is no God at all, etc.) which to auerre to be false, he is and will be ready
to spend his life, and shed his dearest blood. Secondly, that bonum and malum,
virtue and vice, religion and heresy, standing in opposition one against the
other, yet have this concordance by a necessary sequel inserted into the
subject, wherein they are inherent by proper kind: as if you build upon proof
of either by examples, the one shall balance and beard out the other in
authority to the uttermost. Thirdly, that there is no new thing under the
Sun, nor any invention of wit invented, but another wit can equal it by
inuenting the same. Fourthly, that there is no certainty of any thing here on
earth, but that the fall and stand, the life and death, and the very Periods of
times, Kingdoms, Princes, and all sorts of persons, hang upon mutation,
alteration and downfall, known to God alone. Fifthly, that Aristotle's
Principle, scil. Generatio vnius, est corruption alterius, is so perfect a
current of time, and pliable to all, not only physical or natural, but also
moral and political cadences and vp-rests, as no excellency so rare but has
been abased, no complexion so perfect, but has been corrupted, no Majesty so
regal, but has been subjected: no power so great, but has come to nothing:
no foundation so firm, strong, and sure, but has been shaken, yea and
hitherto quite overthrown (unless it were the impregnable rock of the
Church, which hangs upon certitude of divine pillars independent upon humane
chance and change:) and no commonwealth, corporation, society, or state so
prudent, political, and perspicuous in all things to make them famous,
eternized, and their condition of life, government, and order permanent, but
have had their sates by succeeding turns, with a no less fearful eclipse of
their former fame, then a notable diminution of their wonted glory.

Thus came all the mighty Monarchs, Worthies, and Monarchies of the world (as
it were by a natural succession of birth and blood, deuoluted from the father
to the son) to have their rise and fall one after another. He means the
continuance of that Monarchy, from Nimrod or Ninus, to the last of
Nabuchodonosors son, vz. Balsazar, as the Roman Empire from Julius Caesar to
this present, though up and down, as the Assyria^s was.
The Assyrians first swayed the scepter Royal of the worlds Monarchy, and
longest of all other continued with the same: and who then so famous as their
Nabuchodonosor, in whose presence the whole earth kept silence: but yet subject
to corruption. Who ever had a lost^^r fall, as to be turned out of the proper
feature of a man, into the gastfull purport of a beast: and in the end his
Kingdom taken from his house, name and line: no face of a commonwealth
remaining under any Assyrian title at this day. Then rose up the Persian
Prince: and where carried fame her sails aloft, but under the canapeall beauer
of a Darius his brief, He alludeth to the Majesty of King Darius in his
brief summo^ of all the worlds Peers, then under his stately Monarchy, to
come to his solemn feast.
the renowned Monarch of the world in his days: and yet he also was cast off
from the highest Pyramides of fortunes wheel. For although the now Persian
Sophie have recovered an Asiaticke imperial state again: yet by the folly of
Darius, his house and line, the second Monarchy, whereof Daniel spoke, was
translated from the Medes and Persians to the Greeks.

Then in special, the Macedonian Alexander, (a second Worthy of the Gentiles)
was the glory of former fame of his own, and wonder of future ages, as the
only admired at Heroes of the world in his days. But yet such is the
painful birth of Princes, and short, sorrowful, and toylesome life of
Monarchs, in their generation and corruption of kingdoms and regal states, as
Alexander after twelve years reign yielding to destiny in Babylon, there
consumed to dust: his Monarchy was divided into four principal (besides
other inferior) members or Empires. And then again out of that Greekish
corruption did rise a Latin generation of a Roman Monarchy: which in a
tottering state by tract of time, is come unto that pass, wherein we now do
see it. One while the Roman Caesar's, and Octauians carried away the trophies
and triumphs of the world, from all people and nations under heaven. After
them the Albions or great Britons Constantine, merited the renown to the
famous English Isle: then the worthy French Charlemaine got the fame by
Martial prowes and just deserts to his worthy self, people, and nation where
he lived. After that again, the Lumbards, and with them the Germans (where
the imperial triple Crown of Caesar yet remains up and down) had the praise
for many years together,

And now has the Portingals and Spaniards continued and kept the honors point
for Martial exploits these latter years: but who shall carry away the price
in the cadences of the Spaniards God only knows.

Thus came the four Patriarchs of Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and
Constantinople, by succession of honor, wealth and fame in Gods Church, to rise
and fall one after another: and now all decayed, dead and gone from their
ancient state, renown and dignity in the Church of God here militant on
earth. Thus came all Monastical, Heremiticall, and religious orders of Saint
Anthony, of Saint Basil, of Saint Augustine, of Saint Hierome, of Saint
Benedict, of Saint Bernard, of Saint Dominicke, of Saint Frances, of Saint
Clare, of Saint Briget, and sundry other religious orders of men and women, to
have their generation and corruption, by the freedom left of God in humane
actions and man's choice, to be good or bad, virtuous or vicious, and to rise
and fall by succession, one after another, by merited fame and just desert, of
their life, manners and graces, given and employed by them to Gods glory. In
few, thus came the spiritual Knighthoods of the Templers, the Knights of Saint
John's, the Knights of Rhodes, and now of Malto; by a lineall succession of
fame, renown and worthiness to have panigericall histories set forth of
their praises. And the like is of later orders and societies of Carmelists,
Carthusians, Capouchians, Theatines, Jesuits, Bonhommes, etc. all which set
upon the worlds Theater, represent a mournful tragedy of man's misery: how
like to flowers, they have now one and then another order, company or
society, burgened, blossomed, bloomed and flourished: and yet subject to the
fates of free will in all humane wights: their deriuatiues are strayed abroad,
have left and are gone from the obedience, devotion, piety, poverty,
chastity, charity, humility, patience, and religious zeal, which was in the
primitiues and founders of their Orders.

What shall we say more, the whole body mystical of Christ, consisting of the
three estates, Ecclesiastical, Temporal, and Monastical, do auerre the
Peripateticall Prince his principle to be true in all things (depending upon
chance and change) concerning the conversion of countries, people and nations
to the Catholic faith. For was not the generation or beginning of the
Mosaicall law a plain corruption, fall, and decay of the law of nature: all
the Gentiles (presently upon the Orient rise, bright shine, and flourish of the
Israelites Church, and their Hebrew Monarchy) being given over into
infidelity and Idolatry, contrary to the law of nature, under which the
faithful had lived above two thousand years, without distinction of Jew or
Gentile, until this Mosaicall law began. And when for the Jews sins and
offenses, the period of their Monarchy, and end of their synagogues and
temples, honor and religion came, did not then the primitiues of the East
Church amongst the Christians carry away the auriflambe of all religious zeal?
After that, when the heavy cadens of the East Church came, did not also then
the Son of justice, tanquam sponsus procedens de thalamo suo, spread abroad
the bright beams of his spouses glory in a transparant light, throughout
these our West Ocean clouds of heathenish darkness, and give to these
Northren Isles the prerogative regal of Prime-birth to his inheritance if the
Britons, and afterward the English Saxons could have kept it.

When by succeding turns the most part of Asia and Affricke was corrupted and
fallen away, and all Europe converted to the sacred Apostolical Roman faith:
when Monasteries began in this North Christian world to be built, and great
multitudes of Monks, Friars, Canons regulars, Nuns, and other sacred Saints
and holy persons to consort themselves together: when Emperors, Kings, Queens,
Princes, Lords and Ladies of all degrees, fled from their regal Palaces to
private Cells, and left the triumphs of their conquests, the trophies of their
loves, and pompes and pleasures of their Courts, to who so would possess them:
when here an Anchoresse, there an Hermit, and in every wood, wild and desert,
some sacred virgin, valed, invested, interred and dead to the world, was to be
found: when all fertile soyles, all places of pleasure, profit and content,
all earthly wealths, and revenues of most worth, were turned into Abbey and
Church lands, livings and liuelyhoods: when holy emulation was, who might give
most, all gave of the best, and made this flourishing Isle our Ladies dower:
when Kings and Queens, Priests and Prelates, Lords and Ladies, Monks and
Friars, sacred Virgins and chaste Matrons, and all sorts of persons knew their
duties, first to God, to his Church, and to her Priests: then to their Prince,
to the Commonwealth, and to her Peers: and lastly each one to another, how,
when, and where to command or obey: when all things sorted to so sweet a
sympatheall harmony in English hearts, as England by a prerogative royal of
grace divine, merited to be called Anglia chara Deo gens: when flying fame of
their rare Angelical conversation had fronted the coasts of furthest
countries, and occupied with great admiration of mind the mouths of most men
in the world: when England, France and Flaunders, Italy, Bohemia and Germany,
Spain, Portugal and Hungary, Sicilie, Naples and Cyprus, Denmark, Poland and
Sweden, Scotland, Ireland and Norway, did strive for a supremacy to carry away
the garland of virtue, devotion and religion on all sides. Then inimicus homo,
envying at man's felicity, to conform (by permission divine) Gods concurrence
with secondarie causes, to the Philosophers prescript of generation and
corruption: in tract of time, corrupting all these Northren and Western parts
of the world, with contention, ambition, Turcisme, heresy and Pharisaisme; a
new generation of Catholic truth and religion begins to labor, and bring
soorth their children amongst the Indians, Antipodies, and new found world,
before unknown unto these Northren and Western parts: discovered first by
Portingals and Friars, and after proceeded in by Spaniards and Jesuits. And now
listen what followed.

Amongst many other cadences and falls, the heauiest of all the rest has been
judged by many to have been our English calamities, begun at first by the
ambitious aspires of Cardinal Wolsey, who affecting the highest Sovereignty
in causes Ecclesiastical on earth, made a great breach by his contrary
plotting, betwixt King Henry the eight of famous memory, and the Sea
Apostolic. And afterward, when under her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth our
Sovereign now regnant, sundry persons of rare indowments, graces and
abilities, had retired themselves to places of study and service of their Lord
God beyond the seas, where they lived in diverse Seminaries and Colleges,
leading there a right Monastical and religious life, in a most perfect state
of religious profession, calling and order, (as both all other religious
Orders, and Ecclesiastical persons that conuersed with them, or knew their
manner of life, and whereunto their whole study tended, did acknowledge
sometimes in tears) proceeding after their return hither, in simplicitate
cordis, with all humility, patience, and charity, abstracted from all gaul,
guile, or state affairs: as men most willing to communicate Gods blessings and
graces to others, fructifying maruellously in our country by them, and
accepting as coadiutors with them in this their harvest on Gods behalf, all
and every religious person of any Order, that would hazard themselves as they
did, had our language, and should come with like Apostolical commission and
authority wherewith they came: none otherwise then as Saint Augustine our
Apostle first entered this land. Of all the rest of religious Orders, that
undertook with the Seminaries this special conflict, the fathers of the
society of Jesus were the most in number: who presently forgetting the
Apostolical work of Seminary Priests already taken in hand, began foortwith
to take a new preposterous and never heard of Apostolical course for
conversion of countries: to wit, by tampering, temporizing and statizing like
martial men, or common soldiers in the field of war, in all temporal,
mundane, and stratagemicall affairs.

The Seminaries innocently judging the best of their bad meanings (as charity,
they thought, did bind them) were willing at the first to color, hide, and
conceal all: making the Jesuits cause, attempts, intents, practices, and
proceedings, their own in every thing, and yielding to them the pre-eminence,
fame, honor and renown in every action acted by them: until at last they
were entangled by penal laws justly made against them equally, as against the
Jesuits: (whose plots and practices, they seemed at first to defend, or at
least to wink at) and withal perceived that the Ies. religious piety, being
turned into mere secular, or rather temporal and laicall policy, did
occasionate in them an aspire to sovereignty: and that taking an elle upon an
inch given them, did tempt them with an ambitious hope of domineering over
them, and thereby over the whole Clergy and state Ecclesiastical: hand then
the said Priests for their own indempnitie, were driven to provide and look
to themselves. Et hinc illae lachrymae of all the evils that since have ensued,
as well respecting the persecutions inflicted upon us all, for their own
peculiar and private practices, as also in regard of the hartburnings and
contentions, that since have been and are at this present betwixt them and the
Seminary Priests: which heavy accident, and of all other most strange manner
of proceeding in the Jesuits, has caused many to bath their sighs in blood,
and me to theme my speech in tears, to think, how that their insolency has
past so far beyond the bounds of charity, justice and all humanity, as I must
be forced to open to all the world, what gross errors they do maintain, how
maruellously the people are blinded, and seduced by them: and how dangerous a
race they run to their own and all others destruction, that will be currents
of that fatal course begun by them, with contempt of Priesthood and all
Ecclesiastical order, with contempt of sacred Majesty, and all magisteriall
government, and with most turbulent, seditious, and treacherous innouations,
supplantations, defamations, and slanders of all, that rub not on their
lofty bank, rebellions and conspiracies against both Pope and Prince, Church,
Commonwealth, and all estates therein.

And because that (as I have showed) there is nothing permanent or certain
here on earth, save only the power of Priesthood, for administering of the
Sacraments, (that sentence prophetical standing irrepealable for ever, tu es
sacerdos in aeternum secundum ordinem Melchisedech) and that irremoueable
ground of truth, granted only and wholly to the same priestly power, to
remain without all possibility of error in Saint Peter's chair to the worlds
end: all other foundations, assurances, privileges and prerogatives failing,
save this alone: no Monarch in the world being sure of his estate, no religious
Order being certain of their stand, nor person of most perfection being freed
from chance and change, from better to worse, and to have a hideous downfall
this night before to morrow: hereupon (as in our case in hand we have
experience) there rising many thousands of absurdities, whispered into gadding
heads, and itching ears by so many intricate political plots and devises, as
for to set them down in a positive discourse, Rhetorical style, or
historical method, were but oleum and operam perdere: the ignorant multitude
(to whom the matter most belongs for their better instruction, especially whom
the Jesuits use most, as women gospellers, trumpetters of their praises) being
not possibly able to conceive, much less to carry away so many particular
points, as are in question betwixt us and the Jesuits: and as which (if either
they acknowledge an obedience to Gods Church, to the Popes Holiness, and to
all or any Priest, or a due loyalty to their Prince and Sovereign, or a
dutiful respect to the common wealth of their native land, or any love or
affection to their flesh, blood, kindred, friends, and generally to all noble,
generous, and humane English hearts: or lastly, any care of their own souls,
good name and fame before God and man:) they must hear of, conceive of, have
beaten into their heads and hearts, and carry about with them for their better
information, resolution and conceit of things like Catholics indeed, where ever
they go or happen into company, prurientes auribus, and a veritate auditum
auertentes: which is a common case amongst silly women, more devout then
discreet, as always in extremes, either Saints or Devils. I have therefore
thought upon the easiest, readiest, briefest, plainest and exactest of any
other course or method, that (I think) could possibly be found out, as well to
satisfy all parties, that desire to be resolved of all or any point in
question amongst us: or that will not wilfully and maliciously (as God forbid
any Catholic or well minded Schismaticke should) be carried away with popular
applause into manifest errors: as also to deliver the truth and state of the
matter by such interrogatorie questions, Articles or Quodlibets, as shall both
touch to the quick, whatsoever is offered, proposed, or comes to be examined,
qustioned withal, or reasoned upon amongst the learned or ignorant on any
side: and yet withal allay the passions of the contrary affected Reader, and
abate the heat of the haughty heart in all or any that find themselves
touched or grieved therewith. So as by this kind of Method, they shall have
neither cause justly to complain of injury or wrong done or offered unto
them: neither any evasion or means to escape from detecting and making known,
what is in their very hearts, who are wronged, and who are not, what every one
is bound for his own security, to speak, write, believe and practice in these
things, and how far he may go therein. For if that by way of a Quodlibet or
Thesis proposed, a man may without blasphemy, sin, scandal, or any offense
in the world, ask whether God or the Devil be to be honored: whether our
Savior Christ could sin or no: whether our blessed Lady were an adultresse
or common woman or not, etc. and withal to bring arguments sillogisticall,
enthimematicall and inductiue, or exemplarie pro and contra for auerring, and
impugning of the same: then to put forth a question, whether a Seminary
Priest or a Jesuit ought sooner to be credited, esteemed of, and followed:
whether a Jesuit be a good or a bad man: whether their doctrine be erroneous,
treacherous and seditious or not: whether it be lawful to call a knave a knave,
an heretic an heretic, a traitor a traitor, a bastard a bastard, etc. or
not: and how, when, where and upon what occasions such questions, doubts, and
interrogatories may and ought to be proposed, and answer made pro and contra
agreeing to humane conceit, moral capacity, and just censure of and in such
cases, cannot justly incur any reprehension or blame. Besides, this kind of
proceeding shall (as I have said) both drive the true conceit of matters the
better into peoples hearts, heads and ears: and yet not exasperate any by
galling words (which positive discourses in accusations do ordinarily
occasionate, and cannot be avoided) further then the ripping up of truth in
things necessary to be known, must needs stir and move the guilty,
constrained by this means to hold up his hand at bar, and to have his wounds
launced, searched and discovered to the very naked heart in open sight.

This then being the sum of what I intend to write and here propose, to no
other end, as I take my sweet Savior and all his holy Angels and Saints to
witness, then to deliver the ignorant out of error: to give to the tersacred
Apostolical Roman Church, faith and Religion their due, and to make known
what loyalty, what service, what dear affection ought to be in every subject
(even by authority of all laws of God or man) in defense of their Prince,
country and state where they live: I will hold the indifferent, dispassionate,
and diligent Reader, with no longer discourse of a Preamble: but leaving all to
his best conceits, and desiring no evil opinion, sinister construction or
hard censure to pass of my well meant endeavors, I commit his sharp wits, or
her swift thoughts to the speedy encounter of this Bucke of the first head in
the quest at every Quodlibeticall relay, set in the pursuit of their game.

LENVOY.
THE contents of this book shall appear in the Table of the Articles: mean
while be pleased gentle Reader, to take these rules to guide you in this
Discourse.

First, be not hasty to censure of any part or parcel, until you have read
the whole book throughout: if you will be free from partiality, and rest
reformed of error, and quieted in Catholic unity, love and peace.

Secondly, if you find in some Page, the names of particular persons, places,
etc. expressly set down, and in other Pages concealed: take the reason and
cause thereof to be this, to wit: that in the concealment, the respect is had
to the hurt that might be done, by opening such matters, men, time, place,
words, writings, etc. and again, in the express discovery of them, the
respect is had to the common cause hindered by concealment of such persons,
actions, etc.

Thirdly, take this for a rule infallible, that no secret is written of here in
particular, which was not before publicly known as well to our common
adversaries, as to our own company: and that as well by letters taken, as by
their own confessions in public manner whom the fact concerned.

Fourthly, be not too curious in these two points, vz. if you find sundry
faults escaped by the Printer, as quae for quod, Malto for Malta, anno primo
for action prima, and many such like, which the prudent Reader may correct by
the sense, and upon his own knowledge, without setting down Errata here for
every particular. Again, if you find some words more sharp and biting then in
your conceit is requisite, yet do not for that condemn either the whole Book,
which respects the matter, whereupon all our company in effect do agree, and
not the words, sentences, or phrase of speech which respects the humor of
every man with such a difference, as almost impossible to please all men's
veins, or symbolize with their methods, conceits and meanings: neither yet do
you upon dislike of such speeches, or of the Author condemn the cause, or the
rest of his brethren: for what is more common then for one man to give censure
and judge of a case thus, and for another so: and withal even in points of
most importance, a controversy decided in sacred synod, is set down
infallibly true, but the Scribe notwithstanding in adding a reason of his own
in explaning the Text or Canon, may commit a great sin and gross error, and
yet not the decree of the Council to be ever the worse thought of, or of less
credit.

THE ARGUMENT OF THE first General Quodlibet.
FOrasmuch as all these 10 Quodlibets consisting of 10 Articles a piece, have a
relation to the good or harm done, in and to the Church, commonwealth, the
heads of both, and principal members either specificall or individual in
either of them by the Jesuits faction and confederats, in casting of plots for
their purpose and most advantage: as well by plausible persuasions in passages
of speech, as also by countermined platformes in practical conspiracies, I
thought it good to give you to understand (as a point of importance necessary
to be known) that all and every of these Quodlibets and Articles, are of such
special matter, as they are not to be termed Metaphisicall conceits, or
coniectured inventions of speculatiue knowledge, but are in very deed
Physical, practical and known things, which rise in question, and are talked
of every where, of Clergy and Laity, Catholics and Protestants, men and
women, nobles and gentiles, boys and girls, homeborne subjects, and aliens or
strangers: yea, what part of Christendom, nay of the whole Macrocosme this
day, almost is free or exempted from the knowledge or hearing of what I mean
to discuss and reason of in brief: no nation under the cope of heaven but
shall find themselves touched, and to have an interest, part, and portion in
some one or other of these questions quodlibetical, and articles here proposed.
For which cause the first Quodlibet offered as an object to the eyes of the
ignorant, seems sitly to be termed a Quodlibet of plots by scandale and
offense taken by some Pharisaically or Iewishlike, and therefore not to be
regarded: by others superstitiously, or rather too scrupulously, and therefore
necessary to be informed of the truth, and reformed of their error: as being
in the original scandale not directly given, but only taken of their
infirmity and weak judgment, and understanding (for a prudent, wise, and
sound Catholic, or other person of stayed wit, censure and conceit, will never
be scandalized at these contentions or the like.) And therefore have I placed
it in the first rank, and before all other, as an introduction, to take away
all scruple out of devout (but indiscreetly zealous) and tender hearts; in
serious reading, perusing and canuasing the case, and cause of contentions
betwixt us and the Jesuits: as well in these ten cross interrogatories as in
others set down in order, one after another in form following. Amongst all
which this being a chief and common passage of speech, where Catholics,
Scismatikes, and others do meet: to wit, what great scandale these contentions
have given, etc therefore thus go the articles concerning that matter.

THE FIRST QVODLIBET OF plots by scandale.
WHether the Seminary Priests or the Jesuits were first beginners of these
contentions betwixt them, and how long has this thorough burnt coal of
scandale lien smothered in the hot imbers of zealous hearts, before it did
burst out into that hideous flame: which like a Babylonian furnace scorcheth
and burns those who first did cast their brethren into it.

THE ANSWER.
THe Jesuits were the first beginners thereof, and have continued on this
Salamandrian smoke of vaporous heats, even from their first authority gotten
over the English College and Seminaries at Rome, until the foysted in
authority of master Blackwels Archpresbitery was conveyed over the seas into
England. At what time the mistie clouds of long conceited sovereignty did give
a crack, and the lightning flashing over all this whole I Will of England,
Scotland, and Wales: the thunderbolt fell upon the afflicted Priests and
servants of God, striking all resistants with Ecclesiastical censures, without
remorse, pity, compassion taken, or any respect had of either duresse or
imprisonment, or yet the affliction and danger which obroad they lived in day
and night. And if any now be desirous to know more precisely of these
generalities in particular manner, he may please to read sundry books and
records of this matter set out at large, what great troubles, incessant
affliction, and extreme misery, all have endured from time to time, and how
from point to point, one contention did follow upon another, presently after
that discord seeds were once sown in the Roman College, by the plotcasters
of the division betwixt the English and the Welsh: which was nothing else but a
canuas to disgrace that reverend prelate doctor Lewis a Welchman borne,
afterward Bishop of Cassana, by putting master Morris from the Rectorship of
that College, whereunto doctor Lewis had preferred him. The which College was
first founded as an Hospital by Briton, and after English Saxon Kings and
Princes of this land, for the relief of such as went on Pilgrimage, to visit
those holy places, dedicated unto Gods Saints and servants, by the memorable
Martyrdom of 33. Popes, betwixt Saint Peter and Saint Siluester the first:
under whom the Catholic Roman Church had peace and perfect quiet. This
Hospital being now translated into a College by doctor Lewis means, then
Archdeacon to the Bishop of Cambray, and Refrendary to the Pope, at that time
was enriched with the pention of an Abbacy by Gregory the thirteenth of all
holy memory: at what time as Cardinal Allane erected the College at Rhemes
in France, for the same end, intent, and purpose of education, and bringing up
of English youth in virtue and learning, to do their Lord God and country
service.

The sincere and religeous, designments of this grave learned and reverend
Prelate being thus defeated by the displacing of master Morris, and a Jesuit
Priest made Rector of the Seminary in his place: herehence a Sovereignty being
gotten in a sort under a colorable excuse of teaching and reading to the
English youths there (which was the stroke of flintie heads on steely hearts,
that gave fire to the seditious match, which has welnigh set all Christendom
on fire and flame) then followed a pursuit of challenging a superiority by
calling of Counsels, holding of Courts, and deciding of all matters here pell
mell of their own bare word (I mean father Heywood, though after in disgrace)
and other Jesuits and Priests that subjected themselves to his and their
summons, without any known authority in the world so to do: to the great
discomfort, discontent and dislike of many reverend Priests, and other
virtuous, learned, and grave persons of the Catholic Laity: in whose high
prudence it did even then appear, that the fire of ambitious aspires and
contention begun at Rome, was closely conveyed over the English Ocean, and
would break out (if not troade out in time) of it self, as not many years
after it did indeed. For the Seminary Priests, studying wholly the conversion
of souls, and weining their thoughts from all conceits of superiority or
government over others in that afflicted state, wherein all did live: did
never imagine that any Jesuit or religeous person would ever have dreamed, much
less have sought for any such authority over (indeed) their superiors, or at
least their betters (as all Seminary and secular Priests are) neither were
they willing to meddle in opposition against them, if in case they sought for
it (as the wiser sort saw plainly at the first, they most greedily did affect
it) being as desirous to live peaceably with all, as inconsiderate (right
Englishmen-like with their after wits) to foresee what would happen. And if
some one or more brake out in terms against them, upon injuries or wrongs
received at their hands: yet were their complaints and demands of satisfaction
and justice so far from being listened unto by any of the rest of their
brethren (so cunningly had they cast their plots at first, all ouercast with a
bright seeming cloud of religeous zeal) that even those who felt the grief of
the same thorn which pricked them at the heart, durst not once open their lips
to speak in the defense of the innocent: but rather all with one voice: with
general applause and clapping of hands, with whoopes, whowes and hoobubs,
would thrust them out for wranglers, discard them for makebates, and hold them
for uncharitable malcontents, and disordered persons, that should seem to
speak a word against a Jesuit: nay, that should not freely, readily, and
voluntarily consent to whatsoever they defined, designed or determined.

Hereupon the fire of contention more and more inkindling, conglobed together
in the highest cloud of surly minds: and thereby giving greater occasion of
bursting out into an unquenchable flame: the next general conflict to keep in
the smoke was at Wisbich: where by Natures course, and Philosophers consent
(in generation of things) being unnaturally grown to a full ripeness, not
able to hold in any longer: father Edmonds (alias Weston) was the Champion
under whose infest banner of factious contention and seditious aspires displayed
the sharp shot of puny Jesuits and their fautous, made first their challenge
of superiority, and then a division from their brethren the designed Martyrs,
worthy confessors and reverend Priests, of and in that place (some whereof had
endured above twenty years imprisonment for their religion and conscience
sake, before ever some of these hot-spurred censurers knew what durance meant,
as master B^^et for one) and some others also, who had suffered more
affliction and calamity, then any of these their young masters ever yet tasted
of. And last of all the fire bursting out there first (though first enkindled
at Rome, as erst I said) then began the like of fresh at Rome again, where it
burst out into so furious and merciless a consuming flame (for fire and water
have no mercy) as sundry reverend Priests burnt therewith, have deeply
protested they would rather choose (if it were in their choice) to live captives
under the Turk for security of their souls, then under the Jesuits
government, or rather indeed captivity: the temptations suggested by them,
are so many, dangerous, intricate and difficult, which way to overcome them.
And so by succeeding turns, Spain, France, Flanders, and all England became
infected with these Jesuitical contentions and garboyles: the grounds,
originals, causes, and continuance whereof were only, wholly and absolutely
the Jesuits ambitious aspires, fallen down now upon their heads, to their own
destruction, that were the first plotcasters of their innocent brethrens ruins.

THE II. ARTICLE.
Whether the Seminary Priests or the Jesuits have given greater scandale by
publishing of matters abroad, in proiects to the worlds theater, concerning
these contentions before in secret: at the first unknown to the Catholic
Laity, and much less to any Protestant, or other of a contrary Religion: and
which side, part or faction was the first beginners of spreading abroad
infamous letters and libels, against the opposits to their designments.

THE ANSWER.
THe Jesuits were both the beginners of the contentions (as before is showed)
the fuel cariers to the seditious fire-feedings, and the first brokers,
breathers, and brochers of them abroad, both to Catholics, Protestants
Clergy, Laity, men, women, children, home-borne and foreyners, as by sundry of
their letters, libels, and other infamous, seditious, and inuectiue writings,
is yet extant to be seen, as well in printed books, as in many manuscripts of
master Blackwell, father Parsons, Creswell, Currie, Gerard, Martin Array,
Baldwin, Lyster and sundry others: whose false, malicious and most exorbitant
dealings to detect, defame, and utterly exterminate the name, fame, and memory
of the Seminary Priests and Clergy, as well in general, as in special, will
be brought out in deposition against them, when competent judges may be had,
and the cause justly tried. Nay when did ever any Priest write, and much less
commit to the impression of a pamphlet any one word against them? The most part
even of those that had suffered most, longest, and greatest disconsolation and
wrongs put up at their hands, accounted that the touch of any Catholic Priests
good name was tangere pupillam oculi sui: so dainty, nice, and precise a
conscience had they, to detract, defame, or speak evil of any man or woman,
yea though the reports were true. And until all was in an uproar: all Priests
(that sided not with the Jesuits in all things) were brought into obloquie,
contempt, and disgrace: all shunned, avoided: and such slanderous speeches
raised by the Jesuits faction against them, as they knew not possibly how to
live quiet, or to live (in truth) at all by them. Until then (I say) they
winkt, kept silence, and let pass all their letters, libels and injurious
slanders unanswered. They said little or nothing to those erroneous (and yet to
the Jesuits most plausible) books of choice of ghostly fathers. They let pass
that erroneous speech in the Wardword to Sir Francis Hastings watchword; making
Jesuits Christ his equals in a way of absurd comparison: and insinuating
Seminary Priests and other Catholics to be but the Churches refuse.

They friendly admonished the Author of the 3. farewels of the soul (giving to
the Jesuits, that which no religious order would accept of, or durst desire) to
cease from publishing such gross errors, which otherwise had gone to the
press and print (as extolling the Jesuits therein to the skies, above all
possible humane deserts, under the title of religious persons, distinguished
thereby from mere secular Priests as they term the rest) but never did they
publish anything against it.

They suffered with patience that long loud lie to pass vnrecalled, wherein
the Cardinals, and by Cardinal Caietane the Popes Holiness was informed, that
the cause of sending to the Sea Apostolic to have superiors appointed over
the English Priests, was grounded upon great and dangerous contentions risen up
betwixt the Seminary Priests and the Catholic laity in that nation: knowing in
their own conscience there was no contention moving thereunto, but betwixt the
Seminary Priests and themselves, and those of their and the Spanish faction.

They sought not to control that seditious, false, infamous book entitled,
Against the factions in the Church: applied directly by the Archpriest to the
secular Priests, and those that sided with them on the Catholic Church, and
their native countries behalf.

They labored not to call in question those stained records, with all falsehood,
impiety and arrogance on the Jesuits behalf, of the memorable acts done by
their society (forsooth) here in England. viz. how that they only were
persecuted, and not the Seminary Priests: how such and such, and in general,
all that opposed themselves against their proceedings had suffered disgrace and
shame, and came to miserable ends, notwithstanding (and they cannot deny it,
neither are they ignorant thereof) that there be a whole brown dozen twice
ouertold of glorious Martyrs, all Seminary Priests, all defamed by them: all
noted for malcontents, as opposits to their proceedings: These indignities,
calmuniations, injuries, lies and irreligeous vanities, with many the like
unchristian practices did they let pass, and neither did, neither ever would
have set hand to paper to write of these contentions betwixt them until their
long silence, condemned them all as guilty, and the Jesuits prevailed and did
what they list, by backbiting and writing most opprobriously against them.

THE III. ARTICLE.
WHether the Seminary Priests gave any scandale, or committed any sin, or
incurred any danger of falling into schism, by resisting the Archpriest, after
the first sight or hearing of the Cardinals letters: and now of late, since the
general admittance of him upon sight of the Popes Holiness his Bri^fe,
whether they incurred the like offense by writing Apologies in their own
defenses or was, or is it, no sin, scandale, nor offense at all in them so to
do?

THE ANSWER.
IT neither was, nor is any more sin, schism, scandale nor offense in the one
or the other, (they being in justice, charity, loyalty and obedience, for
defense of Christ's church and their country bound to both) then for a
guiltless man condemned, to say, you do me wrong: or for an appellant against
a known Rebel in act, word, or thought, (convinced by demonstration, vel a
priori, vel a posteriori. i. either of the cause or of the effect to have
intent) to say, thou art a traitor. For who of common sense would not have been
touched with scruple, if but hearing of a plain simple man, unexperienced
either in the Church or his countries affairs: (as living private ever since
he came Priest into England, and thereby unacquainted how to manage a matter of
such importance, as his authority in show extended unto, and that throughout a
whole nation; nay throughout two mighty kingdoms: yea and over a gallant
troop of as grave sages, and as fine a breed of wits, as the world this day
enioyes) to be advanced upon the sudden to a higher authority, then ever was
granted to any within this Isle: without all desert (as no way eminent but
obscure, unless it were for libelling against his brethren:) without all
notice given, or knowledge taken of any such man, matter, or manner of
proceeding (unless it were perchance suggested by one sole man, Master
Standish by name, a Jesuits broker, factor, and follower:) without all marks,
signs, and tokens, of judicial, Canonical, or sincere dealing: without all
relation, insinuation, or least show of, and to the intent of those, to whom
the election only, absolutely, and of due right belonged: without all
cognizance, hierogliphie, or ensign of Catholic institution, christianity,
or humanity (the whole sum of his authority consisting in very deed of no
material point, but additions of affliction to affliction, in ordaining an
ignorant man to be flagellum Dei over his brethren, castigando and flagellando
like blind Longius, that pierced our Sauiors side by others appointment,
directing his hand to that tender tersacred and ever blessed heart, and yet he
knew it not:) who, I say, hearing of such an extrauagant, irregulate,
exorbitant, and absurd authority, to tyrannize over the already tormented,
and that by their suggestion, procurement, and foisting in perforce: who had
discovered themselves a little before to be the rocks of scandale to
Priesthood, and shelues of sinke-downe to all princely regalitie (as hereafter
shall be proved, aiming at no lower mark then the highest dignities on earth:)
who would not have suspected, resisted, yea and more readily, roughly, and
roundly, then hitherto the secular Priests did; have deciphered both the
Jesuits and their Archpriest (for how should we call him ours, we having no
part in him, unless a taste and touch of his headie, indiscreet, and evil
packt-vp sententious censures, by their designements flung out against us) upon
the first blast of his authority wafted over the sea, and ere ever the poor
silly man had warmed himself in his vain glory bay.

And again, although they knew his authority was gotten to be confirmed
(vtcunque) from his Holiness, by many false suggestions, shameless cogs, and
impious forgeries: yet putting up all matters, letting by pasts pass for
bypasts, as well for their marvelous, audacious, and passing all ever before
heard of, impudency, insolency, and banded out boldness, in threats,
slanders and exclamations, for not present acceptance of their new found out
authority, upon the bare sight of the Cardinals letters, even with as full
affiance and repose put in them, as if Oracles had come down from heaven: as
also for the manifest wrong offered to our brethren (two reverend learned and
ancient Seminary Priests Doctor Bishop, and Master Charnocke Batcheler in
Divinity) cast into prison, dispoiled (or fitlier said) most cruelly,
unnaturally, and inhumanely robbed of all they had, that could by malice of man
be taken from them; of purpose to stop their passage to his Holiness, and to
terrify all others, from ever daring to make toward the Mother city to
complain of their tyranny (though know they this, and if their faces will not
blush, yet let their ears burn to hear it, that access and audience we will
have, maugre the devils deceits, and their sly devises, or it shall cost us
all our lives, one after another) notwithstanding all the premises, with a full
half score of reasons besides added by me in another place, to prove that the
Priests might have chosen, whether ever they would have admitted of such a
violent intruded authority or not:) yet they in all humble, dutiful, and
obedient wise, with filial submission embracing the Breue, from his Holiness
when it came (which was many months after the first cogge of that dye, for the
cast at all our overthrows, and utter subversion of our country:) if then and
thereupon all libels had surceased (for yet was nothing written against them on
our part: but either a sad silence, or a charitable entreaty to cease of their
detraction) and their tampering in State affairs lien dead: nay, if the
secular Priests could but have lived quietly by them, they would never have set
hand to paper against them, as in the former article is declared.

But the forepast injuries and still of fresh inculcated ignominies,
calumniations and slanders raised, urged and laid on by them, being so
grievous, many and importable to flesh and blood without Gods special grace,
as earth would burst, and clouds would break, and seas would toare in cries
out against them, if men kept silence: our present age will, and all posterity
may account it to be one of the worlds wonders, that the Jesuits being men
holden of all, (but especially in their own ouer-weend conceit) to be sance
peers of the Christian globe, for pregnancie of wit, policy in government,
and piety in intention, how ever they should so far have ouershot
themselves, that bestriding the horse, and having the bridle reins and all in
their own hand, to lead the Priests and all other Catholics which way they
list: they should be thrown down from their lofty mount, out of saddle,
seat and all, by casting out libels of schism against sounder Catholics,
more learned Divines and deuouter Priests (if external signs were judges)
then any punie Father amongst them, which will breed their bane ere all be
ended. But it was no doubt Gods just judgments so to have it, thereby to
stir up the secular and Seminary Priests, to write Apologies in their just
defense: yea and by occasion thereof to take in hand the defense of the
Catholic church, and their native country, nay of all ecclesiastical and
temporal States against them. And therefore to prove it was but a Seians jade
they rode upon (for such is the nature of ambition in greedy affectation of
Sovereignty, as it both makes wise men fools in their drunken conceits, and
strikes them dead with their own weapon, but not Achilles his lance to hurt
and heal at a stroke, as most unfortunate, when they think they are most
secure) it were expressly against the law of God, of nature, and of man, for the
Priests not to break off silence, and send forth Apologies, Pamphlets, and
all kind of Quodlibets in defense of the premises: otherwise all the world
would condemn them as guilty. And therefore of necessity (honor, credit,
fame and report, being as dear as life, and he holden for worse then an
infidel by divine Oracle that is careless of his neighbors, much more of his
own good name) the secular Priests were bound to do all that they have done,
and no sin, unless their too too long silence, which set the Jesuits on
cockehorse at unawares to crow so fast over all. Surely were I a Jesuit and
vnpriested, I would never abide one hour in their order for fear of
afterclaps. Well, I will be no blabbe, nor do wish to be the Prophet of their
destruction: but fiat iustitia and ruant coeli: they have had their time of
defaming, disgracing and accusing, let them give us ours of defending.

THE IIII. ARTICLE.
Whether is it lawful to set out the Jesuits in their proper colors, to use
satyricall and biting words and writings against them: and to detect them of
all such vices as may humble them, and breed in peoples hearts a true conceit
of them even as they are, and none otherwise better or worse. Or else fitter to
conceal from the worlds ear, all such things as yet are not discovered of
them, and only to defend in mild answers, etc?

THE ANSWER.
ALL Priests and others, that are not of that seditious Jesuitical, and
Spanish faction, are bound in charity (as now the case stands) to detect them
to the uttermost. First, for a caveat to the ignorant multitude) seduced by
them) hereafter to beware of them. Secondly, per legem talionis, returning
their malice, foul detraction, defamation, calumniation, obloquie, and what
not invented by them against the innocent, upon their own heads. Thirdly, for
that the same legifer, Who willed the patient, if smitten on the one ear, to
offer the other: did also allow it as just and lawful, that in what sin
soever a man had sinned, in the same he should be punished, and with like
measure to his brother given, it should be remeasured to him again. Fourthly,
for this cause it was, that our Savior Christ himself, although he
acknowledges, that the Scribes and Pharisees sitting in Moses chair, were in
their doctrine to be obeyed (that is, so long as they remained visible members
of and in Gods church, they ought to be obediently believed in all points of
doctrine, concerning the Catholic faith) yet for their corrupt manners, lewd
life, and hypocrisy, with how many vaes and woes to you Scribes and Pharisees
did he come upon them? How many hypocrites, how many progenies and vipers
broodes, and how many Satan's and begotten of the devil did he term them,
yea and sometimes also even his own beloved Apostles? And have not all the
saints and servants of God used the like liberty of speech, when occasion was
given, and time was for it? Read Saint Paul's Epistle to his Timothe, to his
Corinthians, to his Galathians, etc. Read the Ecclesiastical histories of the
words of Saint John the Evangelist, of Saint Policarpe, of Saint Anthony, of
Saint Chrysostom, etc. yea read but for proof hereof sundry of Fa. Parsons
letters, books, libels and pamphlets, together with sundry Satyricals of
Master Blackwels (though silly man, I verily think, he wrote some things
against his conscience, at the instigation of those seeming top of wits,
willing precise Pythagorists the Jesuits.) In the which libels, pamphlets, and
Satyrs, seeing you shall find a manifest (but most unlawful) liberty of
speech to detract the innocent: then a fortiori, no reason but those should be
discovered in way of justice and common charity, who hold an unjust charter of
another man's good name, fame and life, tearing it in pieces with their toungs
every hour at their pleasure: as though the fee simple of all men's acts, words
and thoughts were in their gift, to raise and let fall the price of all at
their devotion. Fifthly, this discovery made by the secular clergy, and
Seminary Priests of the Jesuits treacherous abuse of Synonamaes, Epithetons,
phrases (...) tialitie and simplicity to be made such a dotterell, as the
Jesuits cannot choose but laugh in their sleeue, to think how they can draw,
wind and make him willingly to speak, write or act, what they please with or
against himself, without all sense, honesty, modesty, conscience, religion,
understanding or learning. Insomuch as it appears by this, that his
simplicity is so great, that he stands in such awe of them, and so much and
wholly at the Jesuits devotion to stand or fall; that if they should send unto
him, or will him to set out an edict, that all crows were white, he would
command all under pain of excommunication to subscribe unto it. For how is it
possible otherwise that in a case so manifest as this is, scil: the Jesuits
write directly infamous libels, against both Catholic Priests, and against
the whole Commonwealth of their native land, and against all in general of
both states ecclesiastical and temporal: and the Seculars write only
Apologies in a just defense of all these, this being the case on both sides,
how is it possible that a half witted man (unless overcome with partial
favor or fear) should err so grossly and palpably in the sight of all the
world, as to suspend, excommunicate, etc. or at least make it be given out so,
or wink at the brokers of it, to have it thought that the Priests books may
not be read, and yet the Jesuits books may; nay, shall be commended unto both
men and women of purpose to be read, as most excellent, rare and learned
matter, scil: for to bring their necks into the halter: well if God pardon
master Blackwell this fault, there is good hope, he will pardon all his
offenses; yet is it vincibilis, yea and Crassa ignorantia, in the highest
degree of grosnesse.

Secondly, Master Blackwels authority is only (if he have any, and not lost
all by abuse of it) in causes ecclesiastical concerning Religion, etc. and
therefore let him look to the case of praemunire, for his accepting of an
unheard of sovereignty, contrary to the order prescribed by the ancient laws
of this kingdom, as some do hold, and for his intermedling in allowance of the
Jesuits libels and statizations, and not threaten the seculars in that wherein
he has nothing to do.

Thirdly, if his authority extended (as it is pretended) to inhibite and
forbid all kind of books, but such as he should approve, allow and license:
yet in all reason it has this limitation, viz: where he himself is not a
party: or if not so, yet in an action of life and death, of soul, body,
honor or good name: he cannot forbid any whosoever to write or speak in
defense of any the said lives, and to clear himself if he can: neither can
he yet forbid or forwarne any one to read or hear any thing that may save the
life of the innocent. And therefore the most inhumane, unchristian,
vncatholicke, unjust and uncharitable part that ever was heard of, to stop or
seem to stop the Priests Apologies, written in defense of their good names,
taken away by the Jesuits: an act so cruel, unnatural, and contrary to all
laws divine or humane, as the Popes Holiness cannot dispense with any one, to
fulfill it, no more, then to dispense with any one to kill himself, either
bodily or ghostly, as the not writing of these Apologies, or the like, were (at
least) the spiritual death of sundry reverend Priests.

Fourthly, it is but a mere canuas and cavil of the Jesuits put into the
Archpriests, or some others of their brokers heads, that go about the
countries, with witless scrolles of paper to make them believe that it is
excommunication; or a great sin to read these books, and done only of
purpose, not of any high policy, but of a sly Machiuilian devise of the
Jesuits, to keep the ignorant still in a blind conceit and opinion of their
puritanian holiness, which these books would much discover.

Fifthly, this is one difference betwixt a matter of fact and a matter of faith,
that the first depends upon reasoning and discourse, and therefore is it
called Scientia acquisita, which by some apprehension may this day err, and by
some other to morrow be rightly informed again: and the second is independent
upon all humane knowledge, as a mere gift of God infused into the soul,
whereupon that knowledge we have in matters of faith, takes his name thereof to
be called Scientia infusa, which being once inserted in the soul of man by God
alone, it may afterward be helped (for matters of discourse) by natural wit
and reason. Therefore is it, that wit and will being subject both to error, the
unlearned are justly and very necessarily forbidden to to read heretical
books; lest wading above their heads, they be drowned in error: but in a
matter of fact, depending wholly upon humane causes, experience and common
knowledge, the case is quite altered. For that therein every one is to labor,
and seek to be instructed and to learn experience, how in a like case
thereafter he is to deal: and therefore no excommunication is due for reading
of these books, neither ought any to be debarred from notice taking of them.

THE VI. ARTICLE.
WHether the Catholic laity ought to meddle in these contentions betwixt the
Priests and the Jesuits or not: and what their office is therein?

THE ANSWER.
THey ought to commend the cause to God in their best devotions, to carry a
reverend opinion of every Catholic anointed Priest, what part or faction
soever he be of, to wish, seek, and labor for peace on both sides, and to
defame, contemn or condemn neither party, as the seditious, factious and
mistaught children of the Jesuits do most irreligiously, imitating therein
their spiritual fathers examples. For true it is, such lips, such lettuce:
such meat, such sauce: and such masters such scholars in all degrees. And if
Father Stanney a Jesuit Priest, called (of the Panigericks) the lantern of
England, (because forsooth he was in a chief place of honor) upon occasion of
a cross encounter given him by a Seminary Priest, (who was then in a place of
more ancient estimation and honor, and of a far more noble descent on all
sides, in an honorable assembly) durst speak it openly that the secular
Priests were justly defamed (to wit, at what time as their Archpriests
authority was in hammering, and that certain Priests held out, and would not
yield to put to their helping hand, in working that gross metal to
perfection:) and so said this zealous father they should be still, until they
had submitted themselves to the Archpriest their superior. If one and he their
chief (as being appointed the Provincial of the Jesuits here in England) have
scoffed, ^^^er Garnet.
iested, and made a laughing stock, or stale at, and of Priests acts,
writings, manners and conversation, and like a peremptory companion taken upon
him to appoint some Seminary or secular Priests, to teach young scholars
only, as fit for nothing else in his scornful conceit, others to be but
doctors of clowts, per saltum; and therefore a dishonor to learning to have such
shallow wits and mean scholars proceed, etc. others for want of wit, learning,
and virtuous life and behavior, to be unworthy the name of any Priest. ^
If another surmized holy father of their society (in whose mouth a man would
think butter could not melt) did make no scruple of so gross a lie (for to
bring a Seminary Priest into contempt) as to affirm to a Lady in Notingham
shire, that he was ashamed to hear priesthood so disgraced, as it was by that
parties simplicity, at whom a certain great Counselor made a jest of
admiration, to see so silly a fellow of no talent nor praise-worthie part in
him in the world, to be so much talked of: saying in a smile of contempt (in
turning back from him to his own man) is this the states man, etc. whereas it
is well known the party never spoke with the said Counselor in all his life.

Father Lister.
If an other punie father durst no less audaciously then officiously presume
(as a matter nothing belonging to him, nor he of all other being by any to
whom it did belong entreated: nor yet having any authority so to do) to write
a most ridiculous evil patched up, shameful treatise of schism: and therein
like a profound master Doctor (as a school divine in deed he was, which
study, being as it seemed above his capacity, made his brains idle, his wits
fly out, and his head light ever after) define, denounce, and upon his
lunaticke authority declare all to be schismatickes, that consented not at the
first to the Archpriest, and by consequent, that they were no better then
Ethnickes, Publicanes, etc. and so to be censured and judged of. If yet another
young father of the society plodding about the same subject to bring al secular
Priests, nay and priesthood it self in contempt and disgrace, could not hold in
the wrath of his zeal, but needs he must strike, and withal lend to his
fellow his hatchet (so hotly was this holy society bent at that time against
al secular, and especial seminary Priests, imagining they had had them all on
the hippe, either to have thrown over board at their pleasure, or to have
thrust down under hatches, that they should never have recovered their former
stand) and therefore published it as a most horrible crime, to maintain
dogmatiza^do, that the foresaid resistance was not schism in the Resistens,
and what a damnable state they stood in, that ministered any sacrament in that
case without sufficient contrition, confession and satisfaction made at the
discretion of their ghostly Father: to whom also he gives a caveat to beware
how he receive any such unto him: see how saucy these malapart Jesuits
become, where they once get but never so little advantage.

If the Archpriest (not to be behind with his part, lest he should be thought
witless, or too favorable) confirmed all these things concerning schism, and
the contempts of the Seminary Priests to be justly inflicted. If he durst
command none to listen after, and others of them made a scoff and a jest at
the judicial sentence of the University of Paris (one of the most famous and
chief of the world, and so was always accounted of, save only by this
seditious faction, that despise all men, manners, virtue, learning, wit,
government, etc. but their own.) If he have affirmed it and practiced it, that
lay men might and should be put in office to summon Priests, and to talk,
check, control, and censure of them at their pleasure. If tailors and
cobblers, vassals and servants, with all sorts of lay brothers of the Jesuits
have presumed to go before secular Priests (a place unfitting for any Jesuit
Priest himself to take upon him.)

If a thousand such like contempts of Seminary and secular Priests by Jesuits
themselves have been managed in secret, allowed of by conniuence openly, and
cunningly put in practice every where, though the authors of such irreligeous
contempt of Priesthood, and gross errors tending to a most blaspemous heresy
(as hereafter shall be proved) dare never in presence of any Seminary secular
or Ecclesiastical person avouch it: And if this be one chief principle of
Machiuell (and in very deed of Atheism) to leave no stone of honor or
contempt unremoved, that may either by supply of place, hinder the platform
(as the honor of Priesthood, does the vsurpate pretend of Jesuitical esteem)
or by bringing the adverse party (without whose fall the other cannot possibly
rise to the dignity they aspire unto) into obloquie, contempt and disgrace,
cause a remove, alienation, and change of opinion from the former, wonted and
generally accustomed conceit had of them. As here in the case proposed: who
ever heard or made any question of it, but that a secular Priest was to be
preferred before a monastical person, and most of all before a Jesuit (as
hereafter shall be showed?) Or who but an Arrian, Sabellianist, Montanist
Priscillanist, Puritan or other absurd heretic, did ever go about as the
Jesuits do, to supplant, incroch upon, or seek to overthrow the
Ecclesiastical: dignity and secular state, by way of disdainful and malicious
comparison? They tittle tattle amongst women, and lull babies a sleep with a
black Sanctus in a whuzsh of a whispering foolish noise, amongst boys and
girls: who make it a book of common places for ordinary discoursers, at all
assemblies, in all companies, and with a stagean countenance, as actors in the
Pageant of a play upon these matters: do come out with a Prologue, for the
advancement of the Jesuits in this manner, viz. o rare and admirable persons:
the wonders of the world: glory of these, renown of former, fame of future
days: the most learned, the most prudent, the most grave, the most politic,
the most worthy: the most renowned: the most orderly, discrete, and of best
government, for education, example of life and instruction: the most virtuous,
holy, sainctly, angelical: the most devout, the most perfect, the most
religeous, the most what not of worthy regard or reckning: all superlatiues:
all Analagats: all Metaphisitians: all (I pray God not entia, transcendentia,
for then they put us to our trumpes, how or where to find or place them:) right
Alchumists, that is, sance peers in all things are the fathers of the society,
or fathers only. For it is enough to make known (forsooth) he is a Jesuit:
ergo silence: ergo yield, ergo stoop in his presence, etc. And then must come
forth sundry famous acts, of this and that Jesuit, for their learned books,
their profound doctrine, their wholesome counsel, their good examples given:
even their very looks, iesture and conversation, being able to win any
creature: they are so full of meekness, modesty, gravity, humility, patience:
and of so good nay rare, government, behavior and circumspection in all their
actions: as who but they to be worshipped and adored. But now on the other
side, when they come to play the flirts and parasits with the secular Priests,
then imagine that you see so many puppets dancing the anticke, with sundry
ptishes, face-makings, shaking of their heads, and diverse very disdainful
exclamations as ah hah hah: a Seminary, an old Queen Mary Priest, a secular,
ah ah ah ah: alas poor men: you shall see them all leap at a crust ere it be
long: (Indeed so said that holy father John Gerrard of late to the above named
Lady in Notinghamshire,) They prevail against the fathers? they fit to manage
a matter for peace, conniuence or any relaxation of persecution? They able to
judge, or of sufficiency to write books (as some of them have here and in
Scotland, against that most learned book, by Cardinal Alanes censure of
succession to the English Crown, that ever was written in any age?) They
presume to write libels against those reverend fathers (as Bluet, as Mush, as
Colington, as Charnocke and others have: but so meanly, as I will take a boy
of a Grammar school (said one R.C. a special broker of the Jesuits) shall
write as well and more learnedly, and that more to the purpose then they have?
They take upon them to govern others, having neither wit, learning, religion,
government, nor any thing worth the naming in them. For what are their
Doctors, as Gifford, as Ely, as Bagshaw, as Bishop and others? A company of
Doctors indeed, scant able to say bo to a goose, much less to deal with
Princes, or to be governors. They and their Parisian Sorbonists countenance
out the fathers: whom the chief Princes in Christendom do admire, fear and
reverence? No no, it is well enough known what the Sorbonists are: that the
University of Paris is far to seek for any matter of learning: that a
Parisian Doctor is no body, where a schooleman of the society comes in place:
that the French Clergy is like the French religion, since the fathers were
expeld from amongst them: to wit, both loose, both scandalous, both cold in all
religious actions and piety: that the University of Paris is not now esteemed
of any where, as of no account: as also none other are this day, but where the
fathers live and teach. For so said a Iesuited fellow to a Lancashire Gentleman
of late, making a jest at the censure of Paris concerning schism, using these
or the like words: What (quoth he) do the fathers care for the University of
Paris, or all the French Cleargies opinion, being men of no judgment, nor
learning, nor reckning in the rest of the Christian world?

If these, I say, and many such like scoffs and taunts, together with all the
premises, have been used and practiced in contempt of Priesthood, and
especially of the secular Priests, by their followers, fautors and faction,
being prompted, exhorted, and thoroughly instructed, how to set abroch this
Machiuilean device for the Jesuits and their seditious, factious, and
irregligious (nay I might have said sacrilegious) platform: no marvel then,
though ignorant multitudes of the Catholic laity use their toungs more
liberally against Priests, then either Catholic modesty, civil humanity, or
natural inclination to thankfulness in a true English heart, can either
imagine they would, or like, or allow of in them. No marvel, though they have
not been afraid to detract, revile, yea to lay violent hands with offers to
strike, or run with drawn swords at Priests (seeing it has past as a
principle from the Jesuitical faction, that it is no offense to deliver up a
secular Priest as an adversary to their seditious designments (just puritan
like) into the hands of his or their enemies, etc. No marvel, though here a
Lady A. (otherwise truly religious and honorable) there a Mistress A.V. a
seeming saintly votarie: and every where a whipping Mistress H. (whose tongue
goes like the clacke of a Mill) so very unwomanly, much more so
vncatholik-like do taunt, gibe, and despise the secular priests: being like
antesignanes of some horrible monster to be brought forth very shortly after:
all Arch-heretickes almost having, ere they fell out of Gods church always
acquainted themselves with some talkatiue women seduced by pretense of their
holiness, to be the brochers of their poison and mischief. No marvel though
some ignorant Priests (for though the power of priesthood be all one for the
sacraments in a simple illiterate, Note that all the Jesuits sauiors are
either foolish, ambitions or needy.
or bad living man in the Catholic church, as well as in the wisest, most
learned and religious; yet for instruction of others in matters not only of
faith, but also of manners and fact, wherein judgment, learning, and
experience is required: though many Priests (as in the case proposed) may be
seduced as well as the laity, to follow the Jesuits perswasible applause,
either of simplicity or indiscretion, or of mere want and necessity, not
knowing how to live under a Jesuits frown, or else of an idle rolling stony
vein of ambition, and desire to be counted some body, like him that set the
Roman Capitol on fire) do labor with tooth and nail to withdraw all
Catholics from their wonted reverend conceit of all secular, and especially
Seminary Priests: and their due obedience to their spiritual fathers (a right
trick of all heretics, at their slight or intent to divide themselves by
fall out of Gods church) and thereupon dissuade the ignorant devout souls, that
feign would do well, from coming at any of the factious (forsooth) or
seditious (for so in all things taking the advantage, to second a right
strumpet in crying whoreson first, they play upon the seculars, with these and
the like odious names, justly returned upon their irreligious hearts full of all
gaul, guile and deceit:) pretending it to be a most horrible sin to come at,
or receive any sacraments at their hands. Lo what mischievous uncharitable and
cruel hearted men, these Jesuits and their faction are: dare they, (think you)
avouch this doctrine against the apellants hanging their appeal? No they will
be burnt at a stake for heretics, if ever they come in any Catholic country
and do so. No marvel though (by these and the like impious courses, plotted
beforehand to place such for making of collections for the afflicted, as they
know how to draw with gifts, gains, and fair promises to swear what they
would have them: they have taken away all relief, yea all good, Catholic and
bounden dutiful conceit of such secular Priests as they see daily suffer
persecution for Gods sake: some being constrained hereby to sell their very
clothes off their backs, their Breuiaries and other Service books, and
whatsoever they have besides: others forced to take unseemly and unfit offices
in hand, for casting how to live: and others (now that all catholic charity
is almost quite extinct, and relief flatly denied to such as side not with the
popular faction of these insolent irreligious men) being thereby either taken
as destitute of all place of relying unto: or else (which would make any heart
but a Jesuits, tremble to think on) pined away through grief of mind and want
of food. No marvel if all these and what not other mischiefs be meditated day
and night by the Jesuits faction against the seculars: (for it stands them
upon, or else they want wit to equal Machiauell and their Atheall plots of
perdition withal) to work the ruin of the Seminary Priests to the uttermost,
having committed so many execrable, cursed and never heard of more cruel and
sacrilegious acts already against them; as if they be not victors over them, by
secret murders, or open massacres, these same secular Priests will be their
bane, genius, and fatal fall for ever, out of all Britains bliss, and
present glory they now make vaunt of and enjoy.

THE VII. ARTICLE.
WHether the case standing so by the Jesuits plots and devises, for defaming of
Priests, debarring them of all maintenance, using all cruelty, and breeding of
scruples in timorous tender consciences, either of gross ignorance or wilfully
blind affection, insomuch that though they knew they were damned for it (as some
of them have said no less in effect) yet would they for obedience sake (lo a
flat act of Idolatry) do whatsoever they should will or command them to do?
Whether then the Jesuits and their faction being thus desperately bent, and no
hope nor possibility in the world to reclaim them, in regard of the premises,
until God almighty strike them, as to whom it pertains to take vengeance of
so impious a brood, as ever hitherto he has in defense of the innocent: were
it a greater act of justice, charity, piety, and worthy of higher
commendation in the Seminary Priests to let all lie dead, to suffer the
Jesuits to rule and have their will in all things: and for them (I mean the
seculars) as hitherto, so still to continue in their innocence, suffering with
patience their good names to be torn in pieces, and so low humbled, as they
may all with one voice (which a great many of them may already) say and avouch
it: propter to mortificamur tota die: tanquam purgamenta huius mundi, facti
sumus omnium peripsema etc. or else to prosecute the appeal, and to set out
more books still one upon another, as occasion shall be offered for true
declaration of the case, and refelling of the r assertions, objections or
answers, by fresh reioynders: it being questionless true, that no truth but
may be denied, and being reconfirmed, yet denied again; and so per circulum it
may, and very like it will go, until his Holiness have iudicially and ex
Cathedra decided it. Otherwise the saying is not more old then true: that Plus
potest vnus asinus negare, then tota schola Aristotelis affirmare. And so
without doubt the Jesuits will deny all. Therefore what is best to be done
herein?

THE ANSWER.
TO leave off now and let all lie dead, or as before it was, were an act of
injustice, unlawful, uncharitable, and prejudicial to the whole church of
God. First, for that priesthood it self is called in question: scil. whether a
Ies. cobbler or schoolemaister, being but a lay brother, and no Priest, ought to
take place and go before a secular Priest or no. Secondly, the state
ecclesiastical and secular clergy, is here examined: scil. whether the
addition of this word Jesuit, to one that is already a Priest, do entitle him
in place of regard or esteem to be had of him above a Seminary or secular
Priest, or no. Thirdly, the authority of the Sea Apostolic is here made doubt
of: sci. whether the Priests might lawfully appeal from this mock-powerable,
audacious, blind authority of the Ies. Archpriest or no. Fourthly, the
inextinguible, inexpugnable, and indelible virtue of the sacraments of Christ's
church is here weakened and made scruple of: scil. whether it be of equal force
and validity in a secular Priest as in a Jesuit, etc. Fifthly, the temporal
state and commonwealth of this land, especially all Catholic subjects under
her Majesty, are endangered by running of the Jesuits fatal course, as
hereafter shall be proved. Sixthly, the innocent laity of the simpler, but well
meaning hearts, are already seduced by the Jesuits faction, and more will be (nay
utterly ouerthrown and led away in error, as well against the Catholic church,
as their native country and common wealth) if the seculars let the play fall,
and now sleep in silence. Seventhly, the life, manners, good name, and all that
is in priesthood, in religion, in conscience to be respected, stands now upon
to be tried betwixt the Jesuits and the seculars. Therefore I say that for
these and many other weighty reasons, they ought in bounden duty to prosecute,
so laudable, memorable, and spiritually heroical an act begun, to the
uttermost: and nothing to doubt of aiders throughout all parts of Christendom
to assist the^, to the pulling down of these seditious Templarian Jesuitical
sectaries.

THE VIII. ARTICLE.
Whether then, is not the former charity, zeal and feruor of Catholics on
all sides much hindered by these unsavory contentions or no? how it comes? and
whether the like have ever been before amongst Catholic Priests?

THE ANSWER.
FIrst, whosoever was Catholic a 20. years, or but 16. years agone (about
which time there was a muttering of this Allobrogical government of Fa.
Westons, my self being one (though minimus fratrum meorum) of 22. Seminary
Priests, and so many more of the Catholic laity, of honorable, worshipful,
and meaner calling, all prisoners together in the Marshalseas) he should there
have seen so palpable a difference betwixt the loose Catholics that were
then, and the strictest that are now: as the first might have been patterns of
piety to the second, for all religious, charitable and Catholic actions.
Secondly no question there is in it, but that the like contentio^s have been in
Gods church heretofore, and will be to the worlds end: otherwise could not the
church Catholic be called militant here on earth: nor be fitly compared to a
ship tossed upon the sea one while in danger of sinking, another while of
splitting, and then again of running upon some rock or on ground, and still
interchangeably fleeting betwixt storms and calmes: nor yet parabolized with a
net cast into the sea, gathering and containing in it all kinds of fish and
fry: or with new sown seed, which growing up, is intermixed with weeds.
Thirdly, although it be rather to be accounted of, as a miracle, that all this
while there has not, then to hold it as a scandale, that now there has fallen
out such co^tentions amongst Gods servants and Priests, seeing that in heaven
(and that in a second instant of time, or third of angelical existence) there
was high ambition: in paradise (and that as some learned Divines do hold,
within 3. hours space) there was too much curiosity: in the Apostles school
(and that within 3. years space) there was too deep emulation, contention,
avarice and treason wrought against the supreme Majesty. What should I say
more: if in the Catholic Roman church and Apostolical chair of Peter, there
have been already 23. schisms past; although then no wonder to hear and see
the like contentions to these of ours: yet that the first brochers of any such,
went away scotfree, it was never yet heard of, without a curse; as Lucifer, as
the serpent, as Judas: or else that they were the beginners of some new heresy
or other in the end: as Nicholas, as Arius, as Donatus, as Nouatus (all as rare
men, as great show of zeal in the^, as Catholikly bent, and as many devout
grave, and learned men to side with them at the first, as either Fa. Parsons or
May. Blackwel has.) Fourthly, it is clear that the Jesuits contempt of
priesthood, and irreligious doctrine was and is the original cause before God
and man, of the decay of charity, piety and devotion. And therefore woe to the
first brochers of these mischiefs: Sed nunquid in aeternum irascetur Deus: no,
God forbid.

THE IX. ARTICLE.
Whether then all religious zeal, being turned into temporized platformes, to
cast omnia pro tempore, nihil pro veritate, all Christian charity
counterfetted, all justice violated, all piety decayed and gone, and that
spirit of humility, innocence and simplicity of heart, which erst was in
the late Primitiues of English Catholics being lost, expelled, and almost
quite extinct amongst us. Is it not the cause of withholding others, that would
come into Gods church: or is it no let at all: and if it be, then by whose
means?

THE ANSWER.
IT is questionless the hinderance to some, and rock of scandale to many, that
otherwise would be members visibly of the Catholic church milita^t on earth
(though not one soul is, nor can be kept out thereby, that is of God chosen
(though to us unknown to be of the same church triumphant in excelsis:) and
all this by the sly devises and Machiuilean practices of the Jesuits, as is
manifest. First, for that sundry Schismatickes and well willers to the
Catholic church and religion, standing out hitherto upon worldly respects (as
being more prudent in their mundane muddy generations, said our Savior, then
the children of light) and fears of losses, troubles, and the like, are now
brought into a fools paradise of conceit; that they are in a better state, or
at least more secure for the time, then those that are already catholic
Recusants, by reason of these dangerous contentions they hear of, to be
betwixt the secular clergy, and this (should be Monastical) now
mock-religious: whilst the Catholic laity following the parts of this and
that faction, contend with (Ego sum Pauli, ego Apollo) for a supremacy. And
thus think worldlings to have a good excuse to hold out, and so be of neither
side, but be as neuters or impersonals in terra. Secondly, amongst many Atheall
Paradoxes taught in the Jesuits conclaue, or close conuenticles: I remember an
honorable person, and Lord of high degree, It was a flat Atheall doctrine,
secretly taught in Scotland, where these three things are common: to eat flesh
as company occasioneth: to read al kind of books indifferently, and to go to
the mass in the forenoone, and to a Puritans ser^on the afternoon. All 3.
acts indispensable of the Pope, himself respecting persons, time, and place.
once obiecting unto me, that the Seminary Priests were too scrupulous, nice,
and precise in state cases of conscience: said, that herein the Jesuits took a
far better, and more polliticke course; in that they sought by disputation,
setting out of books, and other private conferences, to make as many close
Catholics (which you, quoth he, call schismatickes) as they can: and yet not
bring any of these into the Church, unless here one, and there one, as may
seem in policy convenient, for keeping a memory of Catholic ceremonies,
and use of sacraments and sacrifice. To the same effect were the words of their
great Polipragmon Fa. Parsons, who audaciously durst presume to affirm, that
it stood not with policy, to have liberty of conscience granted: neither
did he wish it, that persecution should cease in England in afflicting of
Catholics: which passages of speech drawn into one proposition, setting
Atheism for a medius terminus betwixt that honorable Lords opinion, and this
disgraceful Jesuits censure; all English hearts may conceive in these words,
four points of importance: one, that the Jesuits make religion a matter of
State and policy, to draw people unto them by plausible hypocrisy and show
of zeal: not a matter of conscience to direct them aright: another, that they
care not how many souls perish, so they may win their hearts and affections
unto them for the time present, either by admiring them for rare prudence,
learning and government, or adoring them for peerless piety, perfection and
holiness: a third, that in stead of meekness, mercy and compassion, which
of all other ought to shine out most clearly in a religious heart, these men
have put on a stern, harsh and cruel hardness, void of all pity,
mildness, or remorse (save only Cateolinian carrying their countenance in
their hands, to sob and smile in a trice) and so care not what misery,
affliction or persecution fall upon poor distressed Catholics in these heavy
times of our common sadness: whilst they live secure who are the chief
workers of our general incestant calamities, by their figure-flingings,
plot-castings, and libellings against their native country, and present state
of English government in other countries. And the fourth and last is, their
mischievous, bloody, and unnatural practices: in that it is apparent, that
the only cause why they wish persecution of their poor afflicted countrymen,
and brethren to continue, and no relaxation, leave, or liberty to be granted
them, is of purpose to make our Sovereign, her honorable Council and Peers
of the present State, seem more odious, tyrannical, and hateful to all
Christian nations: and thereupon to publish libels and other seditious
pamphlets of conspiracies for conquests and invasions. And this is that good,
reverend, religious esteem, which the Jesuits brokers should indeed have cried
with an O yes in every street court and corner, that they have merited of the
Catholic church and Englands commonwealth, since their first coming into this
land. Thirdly, I might add, as of all other articles, so of this many sundry
causes, reasons, and proofs of the Jesuits impiety: but I must infringe my
speech perforce, to dispatch other matters: only this: whosoever knows the
Jesuits practices (as none living knows them all, and few but know too few of
them) may easily conjecture, that where any of their faction may be heard
speak and be believed, there must needs be a stop, stay, and hinderance of
that souls conversion. For they that have the art to inchaunt the already
converted, to make them refuse the benefit of the sacraments (to the
endaungering of their souls) rather then to come at any Seminary or secular
Priest that is not a current of their damnable doctrine: think you they have
not the same skill of figure-flinging, to withdraw all those that want the
serpe^ts wit to avoid their charms, from coming at any such as are opposite
against them? No^ questionless they want neither art nor evil will, nor yet
malicious means to effect it, as having used from the beginning more
Machiuilean devises, and Atheall practices in secret conference by their
inferior Agents, with Schismatics, yea and with our common adversaries, then
with Catholics and they that can delude any one Catholic, put him or her in
fear, and to have a scruple of conscience to receive any Catholic Priest that
is not of their faction, or at least not against them: it is wonder if all
Schismatickes be not overtaken and misse-led in conceit by them.

THE X. ARTICLE.
Whether then, the case standing so, as in all these 9. precede^t Quodlib.
articles it appears most plain, that the Jesuits have raised much sedition,
wrought great mischief, occasionated sundry afflictions of all Catholic
Recusants: and most mightily and daungerously eclipsed the Churches glory.) Is
it like that these contentions (the premises considered) will be any way
beneficial to Catholics and the whole Church of God, or else hurtful? etc.

THE ANSWER. This Quodlibe^ deciphering the extreme malice and mischievous
intent of the Jesuits, in the former Quodlibets discovered, do^^ closely
insinuate here, what great grief it will be hereafter to many devout
Catholics, to remember how mad and senseless they were to believe, that such
and such Priests were suspended, excommunicated, etc. and that none might come
at them, and only upon the bare word of a Jesuit, or one of his faction.
Whereupon perceiving that it was spoken of mere malice, and sacrilegious
consinage of these hypocrites, those that are now deluded by them, will be
ready to eat their own nails for anger, that they should have been so
credulous, and unkind in believing their enemies false reports against their
dearest friends, and spiritual fathers, that yet still are ready to spend
their blood on Gods behalf for them.

ALthough for the time it may seem hurtful, yet questionless when these
masqued, religious Jesuits are once made known, what and who they are, there
can no harm come thereof: but on the contrary, to every one it will be very
beneficial in the end, and as great a comfort to all true Catholic hearts, as
now it is a grief. First, for that it was never yet seen, but that presently
upon such deadly co^tentions, risen amongst Gods servants and Priests, there
appeared some blazing star, comet, or light of a rare bright shine of the
Churches wonted glory. So was it in the contention amongst the Apostles, when
they strove together for a supremacy, even in our Savior Christ his presence.
So was it in the time of the Arrian heresy, when the whole Church and chief
prelates seemed to be at daggers drawing, with infamous libels put up by
Bishops against Bishops, Priests against Priests, and one religious against
another, before that pious Emperor of all worthy memory, Constantine the
great: and so has it ever been, and no doubt but now so it will be, God
sweetly so disposing. Secondly, of all Axioms in Philosophy, this is holden
for one of the truest, most certain, and infallible rule, that nullum
violentum est perpetuum. Whereupon Christian Philosophers have defined, that
though there were no Scripture, nor Catholic church authority to confirm it:
yet by this phisical position of causes, it is not possible but the world should
make an end, and a stay made of the planets course and heavens motion, by
reason that primum mobile, in a tergiuersed violence of opposite race to the
rest, runs a course against the hair And of like sort by an argument of
induction, vel ab exemplo, vel a comparatione, it must needs follow, that it is
impossible for the Jesuits to hold out long, running a most violent course in
opposition against the whole Church of God, and all the 3. estates
ecclesiastical, temporal, and Monastical: as will appear at large by
induction of particulars of their seditious and wrangling disposition, faction,
and opposition against Popes, Cardinals, Bishops, and other prelates and
priests in the state ecclesiastical: against Kings, Princes, Peers, Nobles,
Gentles, and all sorts of civil Magistrates in the State temporal; against
Canons regular, Monks, Friars, and all other religious orders in the state
Monastical that have any liuelyhoods, which they want: for as a Capouchine once
said, his order lived quietest of any other with the Jesuits, because the
Jesuits would willingly have all, and the Capouchines would willingly have
nothing, but even to keep soul and life together. Thirdly, when our Savior
Christ imposed a necessity to the coming of heresies: he meant not only to
the end that hypocrites might thereby be deciphered, and lewd seducers of
others made known to the world (for he knew them full well himself long
beforehand,) but withal that thereby his spouse might appear more beautiful,
sweet, amiable and glorious. For seeing none can be called properly an
heretic, but such as first have been catholic, either by birth of baptism,
or after conversion and education: and none such draw any multitudes after
their fall unto them, unless during the time of their stand and abode in Gods
church, they had gotten by a counterfeited holiness an admiration of inconstant
people to be had of them. Therefore to the end that those, who by their corrupt
life and manners in the Church, would not only damn themselves, but also draw
many thousands by their external shows and pretenses of piety to hell with
them, should be stopped and prevented of their wretched course, it has ever
pleased the Divine goodness, whose providence is never enough to be admired
at, nor his justice trembled at, nor his mercies magnified: to let be cast a
stumbling block in the way of reprobates, whereby they might take an occasion
to leap out of Gods church: and thereupon God show his just judgments upon
them, and all that leap out with them, and his mercies upon the remainder;
that after their impiety discovered would no longer be seduced by them. And so
in the rise and fall of every one, God is always honored, his church glorified,
and all Catholics hearts greatly comforted and benefited.

Were it not the fear I have to be too tedious, I might here enlarge my self
with a long discourse of all the principal heresies and Archheretickes that
ever have been. For had not Arius many worthy prelates all sound Catholics at
the first to take his part? So had Donatus, so had Nouatus, so had Eutiches, so
had Dioscorus, so had many hundreds of Arch-heretickes as well as he: yea and
such stood on their side, as before ever the contention was decided, had
glorified heaven with Saints, and beautified the earth with Martyrs relics.
And yet we see it was neither an argument of their piety, because so many holy
Ciprians and other blessed men and women, sided on their side at the first:
neither yet a confirmation of their error at the last, because one and he a
Priest was of power to vex, trouble, and torment the whole church of Afric,
and another the Catholic church of Asia in his abortiue Primitiues, and after
the whole christian world infected with his heresies, in many millions of his
followers. And howsoever it happen hereafter, or whether the time be yet come
of revealing the full mystery of iniquity: or that these contentions may
minister occasion before all matters be decided, of another sacred
Apostolical, O Ecumenicall synod to be called: or howsoever it may fall out
hereupon to man unknown: yet do I verily think it was Gods holy will and
providence divine, that the Seminary Priests should once come, on the behalf
of the whole Church of God, to buckle before Saint Peter with the Jesuits
again. And they sooner then any other Ecclesiastical, Monastical or
temporal order, society or company, of none of all which they need doubt, (at
length but to have a joyful furtherance, comfort and assistance in their just
quarrel) because they of all other having merited most, at the Jesuits hands:
as admitting of them to be readers in their Colleges: receiving them
(especially) to be coadiutors with them in Christ his harvest: yielding to
them, nay seeking to subordinate themselves in a sort unto them: and that only
to win the peoples applause, and a name, fame and praise of them to pass above
themselves, notwithstanding they were not ignorant that they had far their
betters amongst them (for even a Sherwin Seminary Priest yielded to tread a
Jesuitical path, and yet he did far surpass a Campion Jesuit, as all the
world knew it:) and in few, they were so obseruant, or rather serviceable unto
them in all things, as what was there but a Jesuit might command in England:
even if they would have had a Priest his crown to have trodden upon, there were
then that would have obeyed, who now like angry sleeping dogs, unwillingly
awaked by them, will both bark, bite, and leap in their faces, for a less
audatious presumption. And then on the other side, considering the Jesuits
great ingratitude, insolency, cruelty, and inhumane tyranny (like storkes
amongst frogs) not contented with an undeserved sovereignty, unless all were
made their bondslaues, to use innocent harmless hearts, as they have used the
Seminary and secular Priests: that possessed no earthly riches, that had no
worldly joys, that sought no settled state in mundane mansions caducall: that
never dreamed of other dignities, conquests or triumphs, but over sin,
schism and heresy, death, hell, and damnation, how to make their vocation
sure by serving their Lord God, with all fear and trembling, in ministering of
Sacraments to devout souls.

This being their whole study and care (ah here how can the sorrowful sequels
be remembered without Apostrophees of inconsolable griefs) that now (poor
worms) they should be trodden under foot in their own corne-fields, in the
heat of their harvest, and even by those that they admitted to be their
coadiutors, and fellow-laborers: and that in their own native country, having
no other place certain to rely upon: whereas the Jesuits have their peculiar
houses and Colleges in every kingdom almost throughout the world? And
therefore of all other if to to greedy desire of sovereignty had not made them
stark blind, they would and might well without their loss or hinderance have
permitted the Seminary and other secular Priests to have lived by the^ in
England, to have past on their time in this vale of tears, here during the
short time of their transitory life, full of all heaviness: and not molested
innocent lambs, that sought no establishing of houses, Colleges, sodalities,
societies, or corporations to remain to posterity, which the Jesuits chiefly
aimed at. This being the ground of al their cruel oppression of the innocent,
crying to heaven for vengeance: I undoubtedly believe, it was Gods holy will to
have the Jesuits impiety known sooner by the Seminary Priests, then by any
other secular or religious: and that no doubt to Gods great glory and the
benefit, comfort and relief of all true Catholic hearts, either in England or
elsewhere.

THE ARGUMENT OF THE second General Quodlibet.
I Have stayed longer upon the first Quodlibet, then time which hasteneth me to
depart hence, will well allow me the like demurre upon the rest. The next
general Quodlibet follows very fitly to be of plots cast by the Jesuits
doctrine; how near they come to Puritanisme, and what it is their doctrinals
of policies do arm at: wherein there are ten Articles to be discussed upon
concerning that matter.

THE I. ARTICLE.
Whether the Jesuits or the Puritanes be more dangerous, pernicious and
noisome to the commonwealth, either of England, Scotland, or any other Realm,
where both or either of them live together or apart?

THE ANSWER.
(...) that all Catholics would seriously weigh the danger that they do
occasionate both to the Church and common wealth, yea and to their own both
bodies and souls reputation, and present state by siding with these sediti^^
and ^acti^u^^^^^ (...) many (...) will not be ^^^med of (...), nor (...) ^^ed
of (...) own folly.
THe Jesuits without all question are more dangerous: not that their doctrine is
as yet either so absurd as the Puritanes (I mean in matters not of faith (for
therein I must and will so long as they remain visible members of Gods Church,
ever esteem of the worst and baddest Jesuit, better then of the best and
sanctliest seeming Puritan that lives) but in matters and doctrine, pertaining
to manners, government, and order of life: nor that their intent is manifested
as yet to be more malicious against both Church, commonwealth, Prince and
Peer, then the Puritanes are: but because the means and their manner of
proceeding is more covert, more seeming substantial, more formal and orderly
in it self: and therefore are they more dangerous, because of the two they are
more like to prevail, by managing of whatsoever they take in hand. And the
rather, for that their grounds are more firm, their persuasions more
plausible, their performance more certain: as having many singular fine wits
amongst them: whereas the Puritanes have none but grossum caputs: many learned
men on their sides, the Puritanes not one: many Gentles, Nobles, yea and some
Princes to side with them: the Puritanes but few of the first: rare to have any
of the second: and none at all (unless it be one) of the last on their side.
And so by consequent if matters come to hearing, hammering and handling betwixt
the Jesuits and Puritanes, the latter are sure to be ridden like fools, and
come to wrack. Whereupon it also follows that the former are in these
respects more dangerous both to the Church and commonwealth, as hereafter
shall at large more manifestly appear.

THE II. ARTICLE.
Whether the Jesuits doctrine abstracted from matters of faith and religion
come nearer in matters of life and manners to the Protestants or to the
Puritanes?

THE ANSWER.
THey are in this respect all wholly Puritanes; and therefore do some for
distinctions sake, call the one Puritan Papists, and the other Puritan
Protestants. To the better understanding whereof a certain great person is
said to have used a comparison, in way of discourse betwixt Jesuits and
Puritanes, conferring them together in this manner, or to this effect here
ensuing.

Of all sects or religions, the Jesuit and the Puritan (quoth he) come nearest
and are fittest to be coupled like cats and dogs together. First for that the
Puritanes count all to be wicked and sinful creatures but themselves: A reason
why some Catholic Gentlemen that live about London (whom I could name, and
what they have said about those ^arie^) were discontented when wanting their
wives 3. or 4. or mo days and nights together, they must be (forsooth) in the
holy exercise: how they have conceited these matters, and whether a new sect of
Anabaptists, or family of love be not greatly suspected, to be engendered of
some foul monster or other amongst these new illuminated Jesuits, I leave it
there.
and the Jesuits will have none to be counted holy, virtuous, or religious,
that are not of their society or followers. Secondly, the Puritanes have their
secret conuenticles and meetings, which none other must be acquainted withal:
and so have the Jesuits. Thirdly, the Puritanes are entered into secret league
of conspiracy, against all other professors of the Gospel: and so are the
Jesuits against all other professors of the Roman faith. Fourthly, the
Puritanes call themselves the sainctly brotherhood, divided from all others,
that are not of their sect and opinion: and the Jesuits call themselves the
holy division separated from all other, that are not of their faction. Fifthly,
the Puritanes have a secret watchword, to know whom to trust, or to admit to
be of their confederacy: and so have the Jesuits. Sixthly, the Puritanes take
an oath, as it is reported, never to reveal to death, any secret done,
attempted or intended by them or amongst them: and to the same effect is the
Jesuits oath, or vow of obedience. Seventhly, the Puritanes judge all men bound
to tell them what they demand, and yet they bound to tell none any thing but
what they please: and even right so the Jesuits. Eighthly, the Puritan holds
he may deny any thing before any Judge whatsoever, that is not of his
fraternity with iura periura, secretum prodere noli: and to the same sense is
the Jesuits equivocations to any but to one of their society. Ninthly, the
Puritanes use all scoffing, scolding, and ignominious disgracing speeches that
may be, with most infamous libels against the Bishops and English Clergy: and
even so so the Jesuits use the like against all the Bishops and Prelates of the
Roman Clergy. Tenthly, the Puritanes all wholly affect singularity in gate,
in countenance, in speech, in apparel and all their actions: and even so do
the Jesuits. Eleuenthly, the Puritanes cannot endure to hear of any to equal
them in any thing: and no more or much less can the Jesuits. Twelftly, the
Puritanes must have all men to obey them: An^ (...) hereof was i^ W^^ch, where
being all examined by civil Magistrates, which were Jesuits and which were
not, not one of those that are known, and acknowledge themselves to be so
indeed, amongst then Jesuitical confederates, but did deny it unto the said
iustic^rs unless one Irish^an, etc.
so must the Jesuits. Thirteenthly, the Puritanes may dispense with some of
their confederacy, to insinuate themselves into the Ministry, and to use
Surplice, cap, cross, ring, and all according to the Queens injunctions:
which is quite contrary to their doctrine, but that they do it for love of
their benefices: and even so the Jesuits may dispense with some of their close
confederates or society, to pass under the name of secular Priests for their
private gain and more advantage, though otherwise their profession be quite
contrary. Fourteenthly, the Puritanes will have no superiors: no more will
the Jesuits. Fifteenthly, the Puritanes will acknowledge no obedience to any
Ecclesiastical dignity: no more will the Jesuits, but yet both of them
counterfeitly and dissemblingly do yield. Sixteenthly, the Puritanes labor to
pull all Bishops down, and to have none but Superintendents in England, and
have made havoc already of all such in Scotland: and the Jesuits will let
no Bishop be in either Realm, if they can keep them from that superiority
over them. Seuenteenthly, the Puritanes seek to pull down Kings and Princes:
and so do the Jesuits. Eighteenthly, the Puritanes would bring all Kings and
commonwealths to a popularitie and Oligarchicall government: and so would
the Jesuits. Nineteenthly, the Puritanes controull both Princes and Prelates,
as if they were their superiors: and the Jesuits check and control both
Pope and Prince, as at least their equals. Twentiethly, the Puritan Ministers
must be of counsel with the Prince, in the highest affairs of his Realm: and
so must the Jesuitical padres, or else all is out of frame. One and
twentiethly, the Puritanes must appoint Prince, Court and Counsel, what to set
down and define in all matters of government and state: and so must the
Jesuits. Two and twentiethly, the Puritanes must have the perusing, ratifying
and confirming, of whatsoever does pass from the Prince or Lords, spiritual
or temporal of the land: and so must the Jesuits, or else it shall be
despised, rejected, and holden for ridiculous, and not worth the setting forth
or publishing. Three and twentiethly, the Puritanes must have all Princes,
Nobles or other states so dutiful and serviceable unto them, as they must not
laugh, they must not play, they must not walk, they must not talk, they must
not give or receive any gifts, or use any private conference, or decent
recreation, etc. without their consent or priuitie: and only so much and no
more, then they appoint them: and even just so is it with the Jesuits. Four
and twentiethly the Puritanes hold he cannot be a good Christian that does
resist them: and the Jesuits, that he cannot be a sound Catholic that speaks
against them, etc. Five and twentiethly, the Puritanes count themselves the new
illuminates, etc. and the Jesuits that they are freer from error, more
familiar with God, more precisely and peculiarly illuminated, and more
specially endued with the spirit of guiding souls, then secular Priests are,
etc. Innumerable of the like comparisons may be made betwixt them in matters of
life and manners (and I pray God not too many in matters of faith and religion)
which seeing they both square, and differ herein from the Protestants: it
follows that the Jesuits and Puritanes, do come nearest together in
platformes, though both opposite one to the other in intention as far as
far may be?

THE III. ARTICLE.
Whether the Jesuits doctrine smell of innovation, and by consequent of
heresy in any thing: or else is it only a singularity in matters of manners,
in all things done or maintained by them.

THE ANSWEE.
IT is one thing to smell of any corruption, and an other to be infected with a
pouant, or stink of the same: and therefore that the Jesuits smell most
horrible of both, and that in a most dangerous manner, it is clear by all
these five and twenty degrees comparatiue, betwixt them and the Puritanes. And
the like may be said of their new institution of an Archpriest: a plain and
manifest innovation, as a word, title, and authority quite out of use in the
Church of God at this day: All you devout but maruelously seduced Catholics:
for the love of our sweet Savior I desire you: and on Gods behalf, I charge
you as you love your own souls, to lay aside all blind affection and partial
doom, and confer one of these Quodlibets with another, and then weigh well
with your selves what cause you have to move you to be so eager in defending
these mo^e dangerous adversaries of your soul, then any other professed enemy
to the Roman Catholic faith.
and never at all taken or appointed to govern in that sense, and to that
intent and purpose as he is taken to be, and is by them instituted and
appointed. How they smell of other dangerous innouations, it will bewray it
self in time.

THE IIII. ARTICLE.
Whether any of them have published in printed books, or openly or in private
conference taught any thing contrary to the belief of the Catholic Roman
Church or not.

THE ANSWER.
THey have, and that every way in printed books, in written copies or
manuscripts: and (but most of all) in private conference. Which (contrary to
their opinion) will not be hardest to get witnesses of, to avouch it to their
face, especially in matters of confession, and other points, which I blush to
write of, as I have had relation made unto me. But to the purpose: whereunto
otherwise do all their libels, letters, and suggested slanders spread abroad
against secular Priests the Ecclesiastical state, and the resemblance betwixt
them and the Puritan Zuinefeldians Anabaptists or family of love, etc. tend,
save only to the broaching abroad of most abominable heresies.

And in particular, whereunto does father Parsons popular doctrine in the
Ciuilians discourse tend, saw only to an absurd heresy of denying free will
in humane actions: when as in the first part and near the beginning thereof,
to cut off all right of succession by birth and blood, he sets me this down
for a general rule, maxim or exioma, scil. Those things that are of the law
of God and nature, are common to all nations, as God and nature are common to
all: ergo if the government and regal right of succession were by the law of
God and nature descending by birth and blood, the same should be common and
alike, in and to all nations, as God and nature are, etc. But we see that is
false: for some nations have one kind of government and manner of succession:
and some another, etc. ergo government and succession by birth and blood, are
not of the law of God and nature.

This Elenchiall fallacy (for he will not dare stand syncategorematically to
approve it) denies slatly free will, putting no difference betwixt the law of
God and nature in man, and the same law in brute beasts: whereas there is not
a boy of any wit, that rightly understands only Porphiries predicables but
would hiss him out of the schools, for a fond wrangling and unlearned
Sophister, to confound natures freedom, in her specificall brood, differenced
by reason and sense (and so leave quite out the third universal) as rationale
and irrationale: or thus, natural reason and natural sense: the former being
naturally as free to change, as the latter is naturally bound to his object.
Neither is any so sottish, as not to know the distinction of natural actions
in creatura rationali and irrationali, sensibili and insensibili: and that by a
liberty naturally inserted in the will of man: it is as free as common, and as
fitly agreeing to the law of God and nature, that man should be mutable in all
his humane actions, and by consequent as natural for him vt creatura
rationalis, to alter his form of government and manner of succession, as it
is of necessity void of all liberty or choice by the same laws in him vt homo
vel creatura humana sensibilis and mortalis to be immutable in his natural
actions: as it is immutable by natures law for smoke to ascend upward, and a
stone fall downward: and yet God and nature common, and all one in their
ordinary concurrence (granted to secondarie causes) to the one as well as the
other.

But for this and other some half score of gross errors like unto it you
shall see (I hope) sufficient matter in confutation of things in the
Antiperistasis to the first part of Parsons Doleman, concerning his many many
gross abuses of both Canon, Civil, and common laws, decrees and customs.

Another principle or proposicion of a Jesuit concerning their false doctrine
contrary to the belief of the Roman Catholic Church is, that the stews are
in Rome cum approbatione as lawful as any Citizen, Magistrate or order of
religion, or yet the Pope himself. Another like heretical, and most dangerous
assertion of theirs is, that the ancient fathers rem transubstantiationis ne
attigerunt. A like to this is their scoff and jest at Priesthood affirming it
to be but a toy, that a Priest is made by tradition of the Challice, patten,
and oast into his hands, etc. And a not much unlike contempt of Priesthood is
collected out of the three farewels of the soul, made simply God-wot by a
wiseman, and yet commended to the skies by the Jesuits and their faction:
because forsooth if that absurd book might have taken place none should have
had any ghostly father but a Jesuit, or some substitute Priest under him.

Yea the Author of that false doctrine and most arrogant hypocritical or
Pharisaicall error, being friendly admonished in a letter from a reverend
Priest to be wary of his writings, and not to be so lavish of his pen, nor
rash with his tongue as he had been, rescribing back in a most saucie and
peremptory manner, taking it in scorn to receive any charitable admonition
(much less such correction as he had justly deserved) at any secular Priests
hands, was grossly bold to tell him, amongst other things, that whereas he
acknowledged a duty, and respect to be had to religeous Priests (meaning
Jesuits, as the tenor of his letter imports) yet to him he acknowledged none,
be being but a secular Priest, and himself a secular gentleman: and no
difference unless it were in this that he might minister the Sacraments to
him, which he could not, etc. A like to these is there no less absurd then
erroneous doctrine concerning their Generals in fallability of truth for
deciding of matters, their absurd paradoxes of equivocation, malepert, bold,
and damnable doctrine in prejudice of the Sea Apostolic, secretly laboring to
infringe the appeal, admitting a company of silly women to be the Archpriests
and Jesuits grave Counselors (an odd conceit fit to have been laughed at by
the Roman Senate whiles gentilisme there ruled: When the wily wagge told his
curious mother the Senators were consulting about plurality of wives, etc.)
Well, yet our English gossippes thus fawned upon by these seducing guides, and
thereby poor souls made fond of them, must be set on with a company of
green heads God wot, and some but base fellows (for so their base
conditions, and dishonest dealing makes them, where otherwise being some of them
gentles of ancient houses, yet deserve to have their arms reuersed, and their
coats pulled over their ears, for speaking or officiously intruding them
selves for bribes and gain to be brokers of these seditious Jesuits errors
against their own consciences, to conicatch those as ignorant as themselves,
and to work as much as in them lies, to make all Catholics abhor, contemn,
and loath both Priests and all, or any of the seculars that are in the
appeal, yea, which is most odious and seditious: they maintain a popularitie
to set all subjects on against their Princes, as hereafter shall be touched at
large. Which with many the like, if they should maintain in any Catholic
country they would be burnt at a stake for it, as absurd heretics one after
another.

I shall be too long perforce: but for the rest I refer the reader to sundry
books set out,, and to be published against them. For it is high time for all
Christendom to look to them, and either to infringe their insolency, and
make them keep their cloisters, and meddle only with their books and beads,
if they be religious as they would be counted: or at least if to teach, preach,
hear confessions, and minister Sacraments, they would have leave: (yea, I say
leave, for leave they must have, how proudly soever they look, and submit
themselves to Bishops, Prelates, secular Clergy, and the state
Ecclesiastical, though this word I know will make them startle and look as
wild as March hares, or rather savage Canibals, (as some have said that were
they not religeous men I must account to find them, if ever they get me within
their clooches:) Well esto quod sic in the mean time, yet so it must be, in
spite of their arrogant vsurpate authority, or else not allowed of so much as
to hear any one confession, nor to say Mass abroad at all, then let them not
presume to take state and jurisdiction Ecclesiastical upon them, and thereby
to censure secular Priests at their pleasure, under whom they must perforce
live, or else run out of their order and abjure it, as prejudicial to their
preferment.

THE V. ARTICLE.
WHether any of them have stood in defense of any of the premises: or of any
other error or heresy by them, No one thing ^^^deth greater ^^^ed and danger
to all Catholic, in England, then the Jesuits a^^se of equiuocating, making it
indeed nothing else but an art of being cogging, ^^^sting: and ^o^ging and that
without all respect of matter, time, place, person (so it be not to a superior
Jesuit) or other circumstance whatsoever. All is one vtiscuentia and ^^ra
partura, secretu^ prodere noli.
either published in books: or insinuated openly, or taught secretly: or not
any at all.

THE ANSWER.
THere have sundry of them apostataed and fallen out of Gods Church, without
ever return or reformation, or recovery, and thereupon have they and other
Jesuits that remained as then in the Church written most bitterly one against
the other, some of whose heretical books my self have seen in print. But
for those that seduce the English Catholics, of whom now principally these
Quodlibets do entreat, they neither can, neither may justly be called
heretics, because they do not stand obstinate in their opinion of any of these
things: neither do they, neither dare they maintain any of these heresies or
errors as yet, whatsoever they intend hereafter, when they see an end of the
appeal, and who will stand to them and who forsake them: but all in such slye
dissembling equivocate and covert sort, as hard it shall be to fasten any error
upon them. For their plots by doctrine like as by all other proiects, tending
rather in deed to flat atheism, then to any particular heresy, they were
unworthy the name of temporised statists (whereof they boast) or to be readers
in Machiuels school (which is their secret practice in scholerisme:) if they
should not deny all and change their opinions, agreeing to time, person and
place: and as a Counselor at the common law once said (rather trusting God
with their souls, then the world with their bodies) he would neither burn for
the one nor hang for the other. So that (as I said) as hard it shall be to
convince them of any errors in matters of faith, as it was to have convinced
Arius who subscribing to the Councels decrees, swear it was true, as it there
was written, (meaning in the paper kept close in his bosom or sleeue) just
like to the Jesuits absurd equiuocating, or counterfeited periuries,
sacriledges and cousinage in abusing the words of S. Paul, with factus sum
omnia omnibus vt omnes lucrifaciam: as much to say in a Jesuitical sense, as
to be a Seminary Priest amongst Seminaries, a Secular Priest amongst
Seculars, a religious man amongst religious, a seditious person amongst
seditious, a factious Spaniard amongst Spaniards, an English traitor amongst
traitors, a Scottish villain amongst Scots, and amongst all these to deny and
affirm to object and answer, to swear and forswear whatsoever may be a gain
to him for his incorporation, pragmaticall commonwealth or society, which
dissembling and Atheall dealing of theirs, to make it manifest to all the
world, doctor Cicils book against father Creton, the Scots Jesuit may suffice.
For who does not know how mightily this Scots father has stood in opposition
in show of the world (at least in presence of Scots and English) against father
Parsons our English Polipragmon, concerning the Scots pretended title to the
English crown. Insomuch as report has gone, that his Majesty King James (by
letters and messages devised and sent from these Scots religious statists, to
settle a sound opinion in his Princely heart of this false hearted hypocrite)
has said, that there was one Jesuit yet (good old father Creton) that dealt
and spoke on his behalf, etc. notwithstanding that the same master Cicile
does clearly prove that this loyal Scots father in the Court of Spain did
run a quite contrary course, sung Placebo to King Philip then; and as a most
infest enemy used as bitter, peremptory and traitorous (or rather irreligious
speeches) of his own Liege, Lord and King, as ever father Parsons had used in
any passage of speech or libell against him.

Therefore do I conclude this article, as with an exposition of the former,
that as probable it is, they will stand out even as the Templars did to death
before they will confess any thing that may discover their great impiety: so
questionless it were no policy in them to profess themselves as yet open
enemies to the Sea Apostolic (much less to stand to any one of their
innouate and new invented paradoxall doctrines) either by word or writing: but
rather to labor at the first to draw the ignorant multitudes (and so by
peecemeale) others of more gravity, wit and learning unto them, by plausible
persuasions: making them believe that they are the reformed Church (for so they
say, a Jesuit is nothing else but a reformed Priest, right Puritans in all
things:) that they seek only to have all Bishops and Prelates, Kings and Princes
^iue in order according to their vocations and calling: that all went to wrack
in England, Scotland, Flanders, Germany, Polony, and where not, before they
came: that Catholic religion, Christian discipline, and orderly life amongst
all Priests and religious persons was even worn out of use and memory until
they revived it: and that they sought only to reduce all from errors and abuses
which were in many old Q Marie Priests and others, and to draw them to the
union of the Sea Apostolic. To which Sea (forsooth) they only did and ever
would acknowledge, an obedience to death: this having been the platform of all
other (or the most part) of heretics at the first under color of rooting evil
out of the Church, and that forsooth in the right of, and on the Catholic
Roman Churches behalf, thereby to bring a greater mischief upon it, that is,
more filth into it; and as our Savior Christ rightly parabolized of such,
finding the house clean swept, they bring seven other foul spirits with them
worse the^ themselves were before. Et sic fiunt nouiss. hominis illius peiora
prioribus. So of very like sort their Pharisaicall, hypocritical, and
mock-mending doctrine of reformation, tends to none other end, the^ to be an
introduction to the sorry sequels of their arrogancy. Whereof we need no
better testimony then Fa. Garnet the Jesuits Provincial here in England, his
forward, resolute and zealous ostentation on the behalf (forsooth of the Sea
Apostolic (O pitiful complaining) for institution of the Archpresbiterie upon
Cardinal Caietans surrepted letter of authority. Which fraudulent institution
and violently intruded Archpresbitery being in a sort (yet with a reverend
regard of the Cardinals grace, and not with that contempt it justly did
deserve) resisted by the secular Priests, this notable companion fa. Garnet in
the froth of his zeal foming against the said seculars to make them seem
odious and contemners of the Popes authority (for so these impudent shameless
men made it seem to the ignorant) said he would (marie would he) stand to
death in defense of the Popes holiness his decree and institution of this new
renowned Prelate.

O huge, monstrous, audacious, nay officious intruding boldness, did you ever
hear the like cogging mate, who to bleare the peoples eyes and to band and
bolster out so horrible a fact, as to thrust a Jesuit Archpriest upon us, and
that most tyrannically to be flagellum Dei over the secular Priests spite of
their teeth, he would make men believe, nay women indeed; (for the most part of
their pure spirits are of the female sex as easiest deluded) that he took
upon him the defense of the Sea Apostolic in managing with huffe and ruff
this foisted in authority. Well yet I cannot blame his wit (though I detest
his hypocrisy in this action, as an act then the which nothing could have
been more prejudicial to the Apostolical Sea, nor more unjustly fathered on
his Holiness) for in deed it stood all such traitors and conspiratours upon
(as he and his companions have showed themselves to be in that and other
actions against both Pope and Prince, but especially against the Nobles and
commonwealth of this land) to have had M. Blackwels authority established by
hook or by crook: otherwise their great Arch-atheall master, father Parsons
with some others of the^ might have come in danger to have been degraded and
set on the pillorie for forgerie, not in small matters or private actions, but
in points of as high importance, as are crowns and kingdoms, or jurisdiction
Apostolical and supreme.

But of this matter I shall have occasion to talk hereafter: only thus much I
have here noted to give the diligent Reader to understand what notable devises
these men have to seduce the ignorant and well meaning hearts: how rightly they
tread the paths of al former heretics at their first entrance into the blind
by ways of singularity, which brought them quite out of the Kings path, high
way, or Watling street: how plain their absurd, gross, and manifest errors
do appear, though it be impossible (by reason of their dissimulation,
equivocation, sophistication, winding, twinding and doubling (to fasten any
heresy upon the^, they will have such interpretations, expositions, comments
and glosses, or rather gloses, and how notwithstanding they may not be justly
termed heretics, because neither is their pertinacie in general yet known,
neither any one man's particular obstinacy made (as yet) manifest in the
premises. And I pray God it never may be but that they may reform, correct,
and humble themselves in time, either by coming out of their order and
society (if they see the danger of their souls perdition, eminent by living
in it: there being some of the^ questionles very good men and innocent of the
guile and deceit, that it is in their chief Rectors, and prouincials) or else
by purging and refining their lives and manners in it in general, that they
may make me and many more false Prophets, who according to that race they do
run cannot judge otherwise of them but as some of the wiser sort amongst
themselves have judged, foretold and presaged of a heavy downfall to come
unto them by their ambition and aspiring. And how sharp, bitter, and extreme
soever, or exorbitant (as some of them term my letters) I may seem in speech
or writing against them, for corasiues (not lenitiues) must help or nothing in
the deep launcing of these inward festred sores, covered over with sound flesh
and skin to outward show, yet God is my witness, I do as affectionatly and
tenderly, as faithfully and unfeignedly wish their amendment even from my very
heart, and in my poor prayers do as daily remember every day upon my knees,
and at Gods holy altar in time of my best memories and devotion: yea and
withal, do recommend their and our unity, peace and quiet together, (as
Catholics, both priests and lay persons should have and live in) to every
penitent that comes unto me under benedicite, as duly and truly as for mine
own needy (because sinful) soul. And so to make an end of this Article, let
none think me to be out of charity in this vehement kind of writing: for I
told you at the first, that the cause why I took this course in hand, to deal
with them by way of Quodlibets, was of set purpose that I might without offense
more readily and roundly touch them to the quick: wishing from henceforth
till all be ended (for perhaps I may touch them more narrowly hereafter, then
as yet I have) that both I in writing, and they all into whose hands these may
come in perusing, may never let this charitable correctiue, and fitly to be
applied speech to our purpose of the princely prophet pass out of our minds,
scil: Irascimini and nolite peccare, etc. with the which kind of anger I do now
proceed in the rest of my Quodlibets.

THE VI. ARTICLE.
WHether any Catholic man or woman be known to be or to have been seduced by
them: and if there have, then by what means?

THE ANSWER.
WHat? any Catholic seduced? yes; who does follow them, but is seduced by
them? What Catholic in England where they bear sway, but is either seduced
or grossly abused by them, for as they make th se 3 sorts of C^th lick here
mentioned the b^oke^s of their forgeries, s^th either the indiscreet,
scrupulous, ignorant zealo^^ (...) the audaciou^, stirring read^ w^tt^d need^e
or else the p^ou^^, haughty, ambitious, we^lth^ So have they other notable
dog^ricks of consonage to cut purses, p^^ke lo^kes, comi^ b^ glaries,
extortion, symony, ^all Lombardi^ia^ kind of devises to make gain of: but
especially by two ge^erall rules: one to win all such to be of their society
that are wealthy and worshipful, or honorable: (...) note, though that they
chase of the finest wits, and most stirring heads that can be gotten for money,
yet when (...) of two, they will alw^ies refuse the pregnant wit for the proud
rich coat, though there be but a dunce within it: which is the cause that they
have so many simple scholars amongst them. Another rule is to get an interest
in the^, that cannot or will not be o^ their society: and so in every house
where they live each Jesuit forsooth, must rule like a Lord ^^am^, for s^ot and
lot, to let and set, and buy and sell all at their pleasure, no man being
Master of his own house where (...) may bear swinge and be admitted of.
Indeed those that least know them do most admire them: and therefore it is a
common question among the meaner sort (as that seditious faction most proudly
count all with whom they are not acquainted) to ask one of another, or of such
Priests as come unto them. I pray you what are these Jesuits, sure they are
men of great account, worthy men, far above any secular Priest. They say in
France noble men would come with their hattes off to them, and yet suffer
secular Priests and others of the French Clergy to stand bare headed before
them. Certainly they are rare men. They are in high places. They never come at
such mean houses as ours are. I never saw any of them but one, and sure he
seemed to be very learned, wise, grave, and some extraordinary person, and so
my brother, or sister, or mother, or d^ughter, or cousin, or some one friend or
other told me in secret, that he was a singular fine man: but it must not in
any case be known abroad in the house among the inferior sort of Catholics,
unless to such, or such, by name. For I tell you, he is not a man that every
one is worthy to come acquainted withal, etc. And thus, per iurari coeperunt
homines Philosophari: These natural Philosophers, or rather plain naturals
indeed, admiring what manner of men the Jesuits should be, began to descant of
a surmised worthiness to be in them above all others: and thereupon inferd by
a senseless sequel of their seeming-sound conceit, that it could not be but the
secular priests were in the wrong, would be overthrown, and impossible for
them to hold out against the Jesuits, who had all the greatest, chiefest, and
most part of the nobles and gentles throughout England on their side: yea, and
of the greatest princes in Christendom to take their parts, whereas the
secular priests had none of any reckoning. For these are the vain vaunts of
their brokers abroad, yea and of Jesuits themselves as arrogantly made, as
falsely affirmed, and neither way priestly, and much less religiously. But what
should a man speak of humility, poverty, or any religious vow or virtue in
them, that can draw out a quintessence from the highest dignities of Pope or
Prince In ordine ad Deum, to make themselves demi Gods on earth, whereby a man
may gather that amongst many other sundry means of seducing and drawing of
others to their faction: one and a chief of all the rest is their Pharisaicall
hypocrisy. Now to the first part of the intertogation.

To name any in particular seduced by them I am very loath, for that they are
all or most part of them of one of these three sorts, and therefore may
probably be reclaimed: to wit, some of the^ are led away of mere simplicity
and indiscreet zeal, whose wits be on the one side insufficient to discern by
outward actions what is in the inward man, which is a hard matter for any to
define of: and on the other side, as insufficient to be practitioners for these
statesmen in regard of the same defect: and therefore are made only Parrots,
Pies, or iangling Iayes, to prattle up and down all that they hear and see:
where you must note, that all which they shall hear or see, must be only of
such things as may stir them up with zeal, (forsooth) and as an act of
spiritual merit to defend these holy Fathers in every thing, and to be ready
to spit in a Priests face, to fly from him as from a vowed enemy of Gods
Church, because an adversary to the Fatthers, and think it to be as horrible
a sin against their conscience to make as great a scruple to come to any
Sacrament or service with them or to ask them blessing, as if they were
Ethnickes, Infidels, or other damned creatures, and already denounced to be
so. But for any other secret or point of importance, they seldom or never
impart it to these tittle tatlers, whereof I could name you besides simple men
a whole brown dozen of silly Gentlewomen about London, that course both water
and land, City and Suburbs, house and fields, with these and the like
speeches, scil. Out upon the Seculars the Seminary Priests, the seditious, the
factious: when as alas, good Ladies (for two of this holy crew are Ladies
indeed) they know not what a faction means, but as I said before like Parrots
speak as they be taught, and so they are to be accounted of accordingly.
Others are wholly depe^ding on them for their temporal necessities and bodily
relief: and as the common saying is, need makes men of occupation, and the
Jesuits having gotten Judas his office (scil to carry the money bag) into
their substitutes hands, disposing of all the wealth and charity of
Catholics (consisting of many thousand pounds) where, how, and to whom they
please, though most sinfully, irreligiously and abusiuely they convert these
Pios vsus, intended by the benefactors where need is most into their own purses
(these are brave religious men, be they not?) or into their purses at least,
from who^ they may conjure it at their pleasures, and make it fly over the
Ocean (under pretense of relieuing the Colleges or Seminaries) to prepare for
an inuasio^. Now what would you have those distressed Catholics to do, that
live in want, either by reason that their livings are taken from them, or upon
some other accident of fortunes frown? the secular Priests are not able to
help them, because they receive not (most of them) one farthing of the common
contribution, but live only upon relief sent them from their private friends: to
get a dodkin of a Jesuit or his procurator it is impossible, unless they will run
with open mouth in defamation of seminary Priests and their very first
spiritual fathers oftentimes that begot them in Christ Jesus to Godward: and
to starve or famish they may not, if possibly they can avoid it. Therefore
must this necessary relation needs be betwixt the Jesuits and these kind of
proctors, that if the Jesuits take away their upper lip, they spill their
whistling: and if they whistle not apace against all the secular Priests, with
panigeries sounded out of the Jesuits praises: then shall they loose their
upper lip, and all their hope of relief. And thus are these needy persons
made another kind of sticklers for them, who according to their qualities and
abilities to do them service with a cleanly conueyance in their actions, shall
be more or less acquainted with some of their secrets, driftes and marks they
shoot at. A third sort of the Jesuits panigerickes or unskillful herauldes in
this blazon, are of those that are men of State in deed: A French Jesuit
rep^^^ing that the King of France gained three millions of gold by them at
their expulsion thence: it cannot be but they have infinite treasure in store
for an exploit when time comes. But it will questionless be their destruction.
bear haughty minds: aspire to high mounts, and expect great matters at the
coming in of the Spaniards, or time of the Jesuits triumphs and conquest made
of this Realm, through aid of foreign powers (together with Indulgences
granted to the aidors, and excommunications thundered out against the
resistants, whereof I will talk anon) levied at their costs and charges,
taking up soldiers every where for pay, if they cannot otherwise prevail by
help of Spain. And these are they which the Jesuits boast not a little of.
And though many of them be not God wot of the wisest (for if they were they
would never be led into a fools paradise, upon Moon shine, hopes of Lucean
towers to be built for them by these great Statistes:) yet by reason, partly of
the great hope (as I said before) of receiving ever an hundred for one: and
partly of some great enemies they have in opposition against themselves they do
run the course of the Jesuits. In deciding of the controversy betwixt the
two great houses of Arundel and Dacre, I have made this point more apparent,
how the one house, that it might the better suppress the other, applaudeth to
all the Jesuits undertake, in hope to be strengthened by them herafter, whilst
the Jesuits in the mean time like greedy caterpillars do pray upon them, and
except it be with the flap of a fox tail, shall never be able to do them any
service. Besides in the said decision I have touched sundry of the exceeding
great, base and most vile, standerous and contemptible indignities, wrongs and
reproaches never in honor to be put up by any of a Dacres blood, offered by the
Jesuits faction to the now Lo: Dacre and his ever honorable house and name. Yea
one of his own, etc. was brought into such a forwardness of following these
holy fathers and taught withal her lesson how to use the art of dissembling,
according to the Jesuits rule, of sweating and forswearing in a contrary sense
and meaning: that she was as bold and resolute, as rash and impudent,
unnaturally to maintain, that she would not for father, mother, sister,
brother, nor all the friends she had in the world besides, ever yield to
forsake the company of one Jesuit (a Pearl for a Lady) let it hap as hap
would, John Gerrard
and yet afterward being charged therewith, or to that effect that she should
have no dealings with any of them, she deeply protested by a letter back unto
his Lordship, that she had not, neither would have, notwithstanding that about
the same time, her said Jesuitical father was either with her or shortly after
came unto her, and since has she had all wholly, such as she knew to be of the
Jesuits faction: in plain terms affirming it, that there should none of the
other side (meaning the secular priests, come to her knowledge) wittingly and
willingly within her doors. Of all which with other practices in the North, as
the secret confederacy made by that faction against his honor, I had intended
to have informed his Lordship, if the foresaid party had not disclosed a
letter which I sent to insinuate as much unto him, and to give him a caveat,
etc. I will say no more here, but that this third kind of co^sorts or factious
heads set on by the Jesuits against the secular Priests, are of the proud,
ambitious and aspiring minds, that hoping to clime high when these Realms of
England, Wales and Scotland, shall be all one Monarchiall I Will of Jesuits, they
are not much to be blamed if they plead their cause and prosecute their
quarrel with tooth and nail.

Thus you see that there must needs be many seduced by them, and especially
devout women (poor souls) who mightily dote and run riot after them. Now
what kind of people they are that live so, and by what art and means these
seditious plot-casters do work it, you shall in the end find to your grief.
In the mean while I must tell you this withal, that of the more grave, wise,
and truly more ancient Catholics and religious sort of both clergy and
laity, men and women, they loose daily more and more: as by their own
confession the case is manfest and clear. For whereas they said about a three
years agone, that there were but three or four of the factious Priests (so
like lozels this Jesuitical faction termed the secular Clergy) they now
acknowledge and cannot deny it (because the names of so many are in printed
books for the appeal) that there are thirty, and yet we will find twice
thirty more. And for three or four noble men and gentlemen of the laity on
our side (as then they said we had no more: and those but of green heads and
shallow wits God wot) we will account unto them so many scores. And the like is
for women, which daily also increase of the better, and grauer sort, more
ancient Catholic and matronlike behauior, as is manifest by those noble
Ladies, some of honor and others of worship born, whereat their saucy factious
Iacks scoffingly do envy: to wit, that any such (matchless matrons by any of
theirs) should modestly defend or speak in behalf of their ghostly fathers:
or else very like it is that their malice does rise of this; that these
(rightly to be termed herein prudent virgins) carrying the oil of Catholic
Christian charity (which their foolish virgins want) about with them in their
timorous and tender hearts, could not be drawn to rail and scold with their
pure spirited souls, (a quality said to be naturally proper to a woman, but
yet neither proper, commendable, nor allowable to any gentlewoman of honor or
worship borne, but a stain to that sex and a dishonor to womanhood: yea and
also to their profession, if they read or rather hear S. Paul's Epistles read
against women tatlers, and Gospellers, wherewith he was troubled, as now the
secular Priests are:) and to revile the Jesuits with reprochful words as their
seeming saints have the secular Clergy every where. Well let it pass, as
the number of the Seminary and Secular fautors do increase on all sides, so
questionless it will do still. And when these hot holy Ladies that now fume out
flames of a Jesuitical and seditious zeal against Priests, shall lay their
hands a little heavier on their hearts with Mea maxima culpa: they will
remember what they have said and done, and thereupon be as ready not to defame
(for we desire it not) but to forsake their wicked seducers the Jesuits that
have set the^ on, to detract, contemn, and despise Christ his Catholic
anointed Priests.

THE VII. ARTICLE.
WHether the Jesuits or secular Priests are or ought sooner to be believed: and
why the one sooner or rather then the other?

THE ANSWER.
Out of this quodlibet is inferied and made known the great folly and will full
scruple of many Catholics, that will believe a false hearted cousining Jesuit
or Jesuitical broker sooner then they will do their own ancient and known
ghostly father, or other secular Priest, and so upon a false suggestion that
any authority (be it lawful or unlawful, inferior or superior without
difference) being once obtained, ought to be obeyed, and by consequent that
none may come to confession, etc. to a secular Priest, because (forsooth) an
heretical (in this point) Jesuit says so, being in very deed themselves with
their Archpresbitery in that danger of suspension, excommunication, and Gods
curse by their wicked courses, which they would cast over to the secular
Clergy in show of the people, not caring what damnable ^^^^e they live in, so
as the blinded with their errors do not know it.
THe secular Priests as worthier and superior persons are ever to be credited
and preferred before the Jesuits in matters of any account, either pertaining
to the Church or Commonwealth. First, because the secular priests represent in
themselves the whole eccesiastical state, which as a prime branch of a
Commonwealth, is ever one and the first of the two, (called States
ecclestiasticall and temporal, or the spiritual and temporal) subjected under
every Christian Prince and King Monarchial throughout the world. Secondly, for
that the laws of this land (concurring herein with the Popes canons and
Caesar's codes) a secular Priest his word is accepted of in counteruaile of
twelve other witnesses, whereas I doubt whether any or all the Jesuits words,
yea or oaths that are in England this day will be accepted of for the value of a
straw by any that knows the: they are so fraudulent and full of equivocations
and doublings. Thirdly, in the matters here in question, the secular Priests
speak not in their own defense alone, but defend the whole ecclesiastical,
yea and temporal state, against these Jesuitical inuaders, corrupters, and
usurpers of both authorities. Fourthly, it is not a more common then true rule,
received of all persons, degrees, and orders, either Christian or Heathen, and
in and by all laws, nations, and ages ratified, confirmed and verified, that
bonum quo communius eo melius: but secular priesthood (not Iesuitical
societies) extends it self over all estates, persons and places; being rightly
called Seculars, because they have the cure and charge of souls laid on their
backs, to direct all that live in a secular, worldly or temporal state, in
matters of conscience and soul affairs as christian directories to al humane
or moral actions, wherein virtue or vice, impiety or holiness, good or bad may
be included. For which cause when the Apostle had commanded all with obedite
prepositis vestris, etc. he gave a reason with a quia ipsi dabunt ratione^ pro
animabus vestris coram Deo: As much to say, as neither father, mother, sister,
brother, or dearest friend: neither Prince, Peer, Lord, Lady, Master or
Mistress: neither Abbot, Prior, Canon, Regular, Monk, Friar, Jesuit, Hermit, or
Anchorite: neither any other person or persons can or shall be admitted to
give an account before God at the latter day on your behalf concerning your
souls affairs whiles you lived secularly in this vale of tears, save only
those appointed over you to take this cure and charge upon them. For which
cause they are also called Curates and Pastors, etc. Fifthly, the Jesuitical
society, although the order be approved by the Pope his Holiness, and therefore
it is to be honored of all good Catholics, and they that live in it agreeing
to their first institution, profession and calling, are therefore also to be
reverenced (if any such be now to be found amongst them:) yet being in the best
sense and construction themselves can make of it, a private peculiar
corporation or an order, not common but proper, and therefore must needs
respect their own society most (yea grant them herein their principle to be
tolerable, In ordine ad Deum) it follows then by necessary sequel, that all
that are not Jesuits, should follow, believe, credit, trust to, and defend the
secular Priests, as a common corporation in the weal public with them, and
not those that even in their Ordine ad Deum, must and will carue for themselves
first, and leave to their fautours, and ignorant favorites, the off-fals,
scumme or refuse of their commodities.

I might here add a new corolarie of another kind, in confirmation of the
credit, respect and esteem that all secular Priests should and may even de iure
and ex merito and condigno, challenge to themselves of the Cath. laity before
any Jesuit whosoever. As first, for that notwithstanding these seditious and
most mischievous men have bespattered with a most dangerous Gangrene, the whole
body mystical of Christ (which unless it be feared up with hot irons here in
England, will never come at Rome to be soundly cured, it has so venimously
infected al flesh) they furthermore, have most maliciously inflamed so many
both men, women and childrens hearts with insulting pride, deep disdain, and
such vehement fury, outrage and malice against secular Priests, as the
unnatural heat of their cursed zeal has past already gradum ad octo, and
pass it any further, it is twenty to one it will pass extra spheram
actiuitatis, and fall into terms of Apostacy: yet spite of the devil and al
Iesuitical Atheism, the secular Priests have bin reverenced ere ever Ignatius
Loiola the Spanish soldier and first founder of the Jesuits order was borne:
they are at this present in the midst of these new masters throughout all
Europe, and they will be when not one Jesuit shall be left alive in the world
(unless they amend their manners and reform their order) but all damned for
heretics, or thrust out of Gods Church as Apostataes and Atheists. I say the
secular Priests have bin, are, and will be after all this, these indiscreet
misled Catholics, ancient, most loving and faithful ghostly fathers. Who (all
gusts, gallings, infamies, contempts, slanders, injuries, wrongs, and other
points of unkindness set aside) do and will love them still unfeignedly: pray
heartily for them day and night, and are, and will be ready to offer their worn
out bodies in prison and abroad for confirmation of them in the Catholic
faith, when these elated Pharisees shall be far to seek.

And further, I put this for a second point, which the Catholic Laity may
please to consider upon, thar the power of Priesthood is called in question by
these new religious Scribes and Pharisees: of whom it is not more strange to
hear into what credit they are grown with the people, especially women, then
to understand into what obloquie, contempt and disgrace the secular priesthood
of Christ is brought by their hypocrisy to the worlds eye, in alluring the
peoples hearts from their ancient true friends and spiritual fathers, and by
their factious opposition against us, never ceasing to calumniate, slander and
defame all men most injuriously, falsely and perfidiously, by their treacherous
proiects and treasonable practices: nor leaving of to insult, triumph and
tyrannize, first over secular Priests, and then over all others that are not
professed Jesuits, most proudly, maliciously and disdainfully. As these things
need not seem strange, (much less incredible, and least of all other
impossible) because their antesignanes or forefathers, (I mean the Scribes and
Pharisees in our Savior Christ his time) discountenanced priesthood with like
pretexts to these: and were grown into as great admiration with the people
then, as these new Jesuitical Scribes are now: witness Josephus, witness all
antiquities, witness Christ himself, who with great zeal did cast those
ietting iugglers out of the temple of Jerusalem. So the^ no Catholic being so
ignorant, simple, or affectionate, but knows and must needs confess, that
priesthood is the chiefest hold, stand and stay for them to build upon: it
follows that they must either renounce the Cath. Churches authority in
crediting these false hearted, seditious and erroneous Jesuits, or else renounce
the said Iesuitical doctrine, and credit the secular clergy and Christ's
church herein.

THE VIII. ARTICLE.
WHether ever any Jesuit have Apostataed from his faith, and fallen out of the
Catholic Church or no, and if there have, whether any such have ever returned
or been reconciled again or not?

THE ANSWER.
NAy ask whether any of them do stand firm, and remain sound and live
conformable to the first institution of their order or no, considering that
even those who otherwise are of good disposition, and have many signs of grace
in them: yet being but of shallow wits, simple conceits, and mean judgment
for casting of plots or statizing, they must silly souls be employed as
practitioners in another kind, to wit, to win affections unto them, and
admiration to be had of them, either by a vowed silence, Quia stultus si
tacuerit pro sapiente reputabitur: or else by rules given them, what they may
speak, and not pass those limits assigned them: or otherwise to employ
themselves as they find every one fittest and best agreeing to feed humorists
with fantastical conceits. Which points if any either make scruple of, yea or
think it not meritorious for obedience sake, or otherwise, do not manage it
hansomely, he is sure to be thrust out for a reprobate, or some evil end to
come to him one way or other.

But now for heretics and Apostataes, I have said enough in the former
Quodlibets, that there are many of them fallen already out of Gods church
without ever return again, and so they do daily, and questionless so they
will do still: there being no more certainty nor assurance of their stand then
of any other, either secular, or religious person, nor in very deed so much (as
they now live) because they have made religion, but an art of such as live by
their wits, and (as I said before) a very hotch potch of omnium githerum,
religious secular, cleargicall, laicall, ecclesiastical, monastical,
spiritual, temporal, martial, civil, oeconomicall, political, liberal,
mechanical, municipiall, irregular, and all without order. And howsoever they
brag, band and boast of their familiarity with God, their rare and special
indowments for guiding and government of souls more then secular Priests have
(whom Catholics are admonished to take heed of, and beware of all Priests in
general, that are not either Jesuits or guided by Jesuits in all things)
their high contempt of Priesthood, their fanaticall dreams of extraordinary
inspirations, insufflations, illuminations (or term them incantations, or what
you list, for all is stark naught) yet will they never or hardly be able to
recover that credit they have lost throughout all Christendom by these
arrogant vaunts of their holiness.

And as for the last point, whether any of them have returned again into Gods
Church after their lapse or no: another question might be made whether they
have not brewed a new heresy in a green fustie vessel, or broched an old,
raised up ab orco out of a rotten stinking caske, in maintaining it in precise
terms as they have, viz: that after a man is fallen out of the Catholic
Church, although he return again and be reco^^iled to outward show: yet is he
still an Apostata, and so to be accounted for ever after, and never to be
admitted of into the Church of God, to bear any authority, or to be preferred
to any ecclesiastical dignity, as one of God forsaken, and impossible for
such ever to recover their former grace, and stand again. Insomuch as hereby
you may note, that if S. Peter had come under a Jesuits censure (as he did
under his merciful Lord and Master Jesus after his relapse with thrice denial
and forswearing of him) he should never to death have been head of the Church
afterward, no nor ever numbered amongst the twelve Apostles: nor yet judged
worthy to have been one of the seven Deacons equals: but well, if he had
recovered the name of one of the seventy Disciples amongst these sharp
censurers of all men. And this is the cause why it has seemed so rare amongst
the ignorant people to hear of a Jesuits fall out of the church. Were it not
that al histories, Chronicles, antiquities and dailye examples make it manifest
that there is no error so gross, no sect so absurd, no here^y so blasphemous,
no archbroker of any impiety, so base, but has had and still will have
millions of folowers, yea and at the first before they be discovered) some very
wise, blessed, and perhaps learned men, to follow favor and defend or allow of
them: I should otherwise have thought it impossible that so many sound
Catholics, and some wise, learned and vertu^^^, should ever have been blinded
with these ^^arisa^call Jesuits as they are (...) it is ^^^oueltie, neither
^^y ^^^^^ent of a Ie^^^^ piety of just ca^se.
Nay whosoever should say so, or yet that a Jesuit could fall or err, or
misgouern himself or others, or do any thing amiss, you shall have a young
Iesuitesse ready to fly in his face, to cast the house out at the window where
she stands, and better had it been for such an infamous detractor (forsooth) to
have gone an hundred miles on his bare feet, then ever to have spoken such a
word, as being sure to be accounted of as a spy, an heretic, or at least an
unsound Catholic, attainted in his good name ever after: for who can faste^
such a slander upon these new illuminates, they have such cogging shifts with
them, and so many of them: as that (amongst others) if any going under the name
of a Jesuit chance to fall, then it shall be given out that he was a Seminary
or secular Priest, and quite discarded from the society. If it be so manifest
as it cannot be denied, but he was a Jesuit indeed: then shall he either be
gotten in and reconciled again, and so secretly conveyed out of the land, or
else the matter hushed up in hucker mucker, so as it shall never be after
spoken of: for you know a wonder lasts but nine days, and then it is
forgotten, (especially if no reckoning be made of it) as though it had never
been.

And this Machiuilian trick they have by means of their spials and
intelligents in every country, court and corner, that so soon as ever any
mishap does happen to any one, they presently being certified thereof, set down
the conclusion: whether such a party his fall or other evil demeanure, be
fitter to be blazed abroad or smoothered up, or in what sort it may be handled
to their most advantage, and accordingly hereunto, if he be one of theirs, and
that the fact cannot be concealed, then to give it out as a trifle, light
matter, or thing of nothing: or else that the party was one long agone
rejected and never accounted of amongst them, but yet let alone, for that they
knew what end he would make before hand, etc. And so the speech going abroad
amongst Catholics, as sent first from the fathers, there is little or no talk
of it, as not worthy of any memory or notice: and such in a sort was Master
Wrights case, though to their shame he has proved better then any of them as
yet have proved: and far better since he has consorted himself to live as
other Priests did, then when at the first he had a smacke of their
singularity in his proceedings. But let it be of any Seminary or secular
Priest, and then all the belles in the Town, nay in the whole Realm must ring
of it: nay sea and land must be coursed and canuassed with their letters,
posts and messengers, in the pass and repasse out of England into France,
and from France to Flaunders, and thence into Italy, Germany, Rome, Spain,
Portugal and Jerusalem, to blaze it abroad of the weakness, looseness,
scandale, badde and corrupt life of all Seminaries and secular Priests in
general: and how unfit they are to come into England, or for any of them to
take the charge of souls upon them, for one man's offense or miscariage. And he
unhappy man, whose life, death and good name, for ever after must hang in the
blast of their mouths, though he repent with S. Peter, or recant with S.
Marcelline, yet shall his first fault be laid in his dish ever after, with
Pharisaicall vpbraiding of him whenever occasion is offered of a malicious
revenge to betaken. Nay what is more common with these precise pure
illuminates, then thus to censure of the most constant Martyrs and Confessors
(if not wholly Iesuited) of this age? Who though they never could be touched
with any act, word or thought of revolt from Gods Church, or stepping any whit
awrie: yet these devilish spirits of a Luciferian pride and conceit of their
own proper excellency, will touch them to the quick with these speeches: I
pray God he may stand, he is but a weak man, such a father had been fitter
then he to have managed such a matter, etc.

THE IX. ARTICLE.
Whether in regard of the premises, if the Jesuits be such wicked men, and so
far gone astray from the first prescript and institution of their order, is
there any likelihood of their continuance: or if not, then of what downfall?

THE ANSWER.
I Told you before that Nullum violentum est perpetuum: (which is to be
understood of all humane and natural causes, acts and motions: and that some
of the Jesuits themselves have presaged (if not prophesied) by many fearful
signs, a heavy destruction, ruin and downfall to come unto their society,
by reason of the great pride, insolency, heat of ambition, and unquenchable
thirst, in affecting of sovereignty which reigns amongst them. But what fall
it is they shall have, or where or when it will happen, God he knows: as for
me, Non sum Propheta, nec filius Prophetae, neither wish I to be: but shall
truly rather bewail to see the genius of their hard fortune, that men of so
many good talents, worthy parts, singular abilities, and rare indowments (as
sundry of them have) should be bewitched as they are, and as men inuolued in
laberinths of errors, drown themselves in the Stigean lake of their own
folly. Well, Solomon was wiser, more learned, of better government, fitter to
rule, had a more peculiar gift and grace in all things, and more often secreter
and nearer familiarity with God then ever any of them had to this hour here
on earth, and yet he became a profane Idolater. And therefore howsoever the
Machiuilian or rather Mahumetane-like faction, give it out that it has bin
revealed unto their fou^der how mightily his society should be impugned, but
still shall prevail, etc. (whereof I will speak hereafter) yet am I rather
moved to embrace the common opinion, scil: that their end will be a right
Templarian downfall, which for to make seem probable (because I am still in
every Quodlibet forced to be too tedious) I will refeerre you for this matter
to a peculiar work which I have taken some pains about in comparing first the
Templars and the Jesuits together: then the Jesuits and Machiuell: after that,
Cardinal Wolsey and father Parsons: and last of all the comtemplatiues of the
said Parsons in Greencoate to the actiues of the same man in his practiced
Doleman for a Monarchy. In which book (if it happen to come forth) you shall
see how all ambitions aspirers have risen up at the first and by what means:
how base persons have attained to highest dignities: how a man may insinuate
himself to become great, famous and admired at, and what is required to make
fortune (as thsy say) a man's friend: In the mean space let it suffice that the
Jesuits are and shall be well warned (and therefore surely armed if they have
grace to accept of it) to look to themselves and alter their course in time,
lest they be taken napping at unawares as the Templars were.

THE X. ARTICLE.
WHether any danger to Gods Church to err, and utterly to be overthrown by
the Jesuits ruin (if it happen) or no danger at all?

THE ANSWER.
NO danger at all of either error, or any overthrow, hurt, or inconvenience to
come to the Church, yea or to the least member thereof by their outcast: but
rather in very deed a greater security to all to have such infectious poison
burst, and stinking weeds rooted out, that the good and bad do not perish
altogether by their abode amongst us. So that amongst many other fables of
their folly (or rather of the ignorant multitudes folly seduced by them) this
is one: to bear people in hand, that these gallants (courtly rabbis, chill
warrant you in their coaches) have such a special charge, care, and authority
committed unto them, of and over the whole Cotholicke Church, that fail they,
or be they once expelled and thrust out of England, all piety, devotion,
Christian discipline and religion, Before ever any Jesuits came in England to
plot conspiracies against our Sovereign and her Realm, and to sow sedition
amongst Catholic, and contention amongst Priests, there was more joy,
comfort, and truly Catholics, unfeigned charity showed to one another in one
day, then there is now in a whole year.
will presently quail, perish and play turn Turk into Atheism. Thus said
they before and at their expulsion (for high treason) out of France: but yet
they proved false Prophets, Gods Church having flourished more since their
exile thence, then ever it did whiles they were amongst the^. Nay what have
they said more and auerd, avouched, and confirmed the same by writings,
preachings and other passages, all their endeavors tending to this end?
forsooth they have not been scrupulous to affirm, that he could not be a sound
Catholic; (and therefore father Parsons in Philopater is bold to call great
Henry the now most Christian King of France, a very reprobate and one
impossible to be a sound Catholic: nor yet the whole Realm of France ever
soundly to be converted, and so of others) that should any way dislike of the
Jesuits proceedings against England. But for any directly to oppose himself
against those men's holy designements, as sundry Catholics did in France:
mary sir that were matter enough to make him burn at a stake, and the like it
were to impugn the king of Spain, or Archduches his daughters pretended title
to the English Crown. Nay which is a most odious and loathsome breath of bloody
broiles, garboiles and cruelties threatened to all Nations by these Ascismists
(for what are they all say some that know them, but massacring butcherly buyers
and sellers of their dear countriemens blood?) they go about busily to
persuade such a reciprocation to be betwixt the King Catholic of Spain, and
the faith Catholic of Rome, that as real relations the latter relative
cannot be without his former correlatiue, which must give him his being and
essence in nature. Insomuch as it is become a point of necessity, or (as they
absurdly and heretically would make men believe) a thirteenth Article of our
faith: that either all Catholic Christians must endeavor to put all Europe
into a Spaniards hands: or otherwise that the Catholic religion will be
utterly extinguished and perish, and so by consequent all run Hysteron
Protheron, a milne horse, a King Pope, a Curch Spaniard, and the faith of S.
Peter and his successors must hang upon the monarchy of King Philip and his
heirs. And how long forsooth? Mary even so long as the Jesuits shall please;
which is until they may be able to pull him and all other Princes down from
their thrones by causing popular rebellions, as hereafter shall be proved.
Well, well, these fellows must be talked withal in time, and made to know
themselves and their gross errors against al divinity, philosophy, policy,
piety and order. Mean while we leave them to chop logic in barbarism, and
feed their chimericall, conceits with Relatiues of Ens rationis, or rather Ens
insensibile insensatum irroale, infatuatum, fictum, and so pass on to the next
point of plot-casting by Fame and Report of the unworthy heroical,
matchless, magnificall Mecenates.

THE ARGUMENT FOR THE THIRD GENERAL QVODLIBET.
ONe nail drives in another, the first party prouokes a reioynder by a second
encounter: and upon occasion of plots cast by doctrine principles, rules and
observations of practice, does necessarily follow a Quodlibet of new plots cast
by Fame and Report, and how the Jesuits come to be enriched, honored, and
regarded, with preferments above their deserts by that means.

THE THIRD GENERAL QVODlibet of plots by Fame and Report.
THE I. ARTICLE.
WHether the Jesuits or any other religious order be to be preferred before
secular Priests or not, or (if not) whether the said Jesuits are to be
preferred before all other monastical or religious orders: or which and how
many are before them?

THE ANSWER.
IT is never enough to be admired at, that religious men being by vow and
profession dead and buried to the world, should be blinded with a conceit: Note
here a simple conceit of good father Gerard, to infer a Jesuits place to be
above a secular Priests, because forsooth, an old Queen Marie Priest told him
that he had seen religious men sit above other priests at Table. Well poor
man I pity his simplicity in that, being otherwise of a good nature, he is
much blinded and corrupted in his life and manners, by being a Jesuit (which
society would God he did and would forsake, considering how it is now
corrupted) as any one amongst them. But for his author God wot, many Priest^
and other men and women were and are too submissiue at sometimes to their
inferiors, and though in carresie a religious person (as a stranger be placed
above a priest as an ordinary guest or friend, or in his own house (which is
civility so to do) yet it is no way of due, right, nor ever was so taken.
that they can possibly simul and semel and sub vno and eodem subiecto, be
dead, and alive, mortified and made lively: yea, and that spiritu and carne
simul, (for to be mortificatos quidem carne viuificatos autem spiritu, is no
less then every Christian Catholic may and should be) and to be wholly
sequestrate from the world in body and mind, and yet withal, al wholly,
substantially and actually plodding in it, with body and soul over head and
ears. Yet we must believe that such is the Jesuits rare calling and state,
that forsooth they are wholly dead and wholly alive, absolute spiritual men, and
yet mere worldlings, which if they can make good and go through with it, I say
it is a greater miracle to speak ad homine^ (for in respect of Gods
omnipotency miracles admit not maius and minus) then to raise a triduane
Lazarus from death to life again, yea only to the patible and withal,
impatible body of our Savior Christ was this privilege left as a prerogative
royal reserved to his sacred Majesty divine: that it should be simul and
semel, dead and alive. And this only by reason of the hypostasis or
hypostaticall union of his deity to his humanity. By means whereof
(restraming, infringing and holding in, the impregnable force of the first in
the time of his bitter death and passion, for otherwise he could not have
suffered: in speech of miracles, we say it was more miraculous, because more
seeming impossible, how that ever he could suffer death, then for him to rise
from death to life again: suffering the same power divine, to have his yet
limited force again, after that fearful and last gasp in giving up his
blessed ghost upon the cross) it followed that the same tres-sacred body, or
totum compositum Christ himself was both dead and buried, and yet the same
Christ alive both in soul descending into hell untouched, and also in body
lying three days and nights in his grave, and yet not corrupted as powerably
preserved per concomitantiam diuinitatis, so as no corruption of man's mortality
could then take place: And therefore the Jesuits striving for a superiority
above seculars, would go an ace above both their and our Lord and master Jesus
(the circumstances considered) in this their miraculous working of wonders in
themselves by their spiritual death and temporal resurrection. Here may be
well remembered a merry jest of a Gentlewoman in Fetter-l^ne, who talking of one
master Edward Cossin (a sorry fellow god-wot, but who is so bold as blind
Bayard, and none more arrogant in place taking then this punie father) a Priest
gone then over to be a Jesuit: yea quoth she is he gone, now truly then I see
he will seek to a state of more perfection. Well yet pure Lady by her leave,
this (though a Jesuitical fond persuasion) was quite contrary to a solemn
protestation made by a chief father at Rome, in excuse of enticing the English
youth, who said that ^f he were to choose a state of perfection: he would
sooner choose to go as a Seminary Priest into England, the^ to enter into, or be
of the str^ctest order of religion whatsoever,


Of this matter I have written a peculiar Treatise, which is one of the 10.
volumes or books I mean to set out against these new masters the Jesuits, and
their (especially father Parsons) errors, as time, place, approbation, and
other occasions shall permit, persuade, and allow me, wherein I have made an
historical discourse or chronicle of the conversion of all countries to the
Christian faith, the beginning, progress, end and fall (of such and so many as
are gone) of every religious order, as well of the Basilians, Antonians, and
other amongst the Greeks, as of the Benectins, Augustines, Franciscans, etc.
amongst the Latins. Which are first in place, taking of one the other (for
never did any religious person but a Jesuit, seek, accept, or look for any
place before a secular Priest) and how they follow in order according to the
time of their original institution, and beginning one after another. Of all
which approved, confirmed and allowed of orders, seeing the Jesuit is the last,
and by consequence inferior to all other before it: then does it necessarily
follow that their society or any of the^, ought least of any other to incroch
upon secular Priests, or the state Ecclesiastical in place taking or
expectation of any honor or preferment before the secular Clergy to be due
unto them. And this might seem to serve for that matter.

But now because their insolency herein is intolerable, and their audacious
boldness, marvelous extreme in contempt both of Princes and Priests (^.
distinct dignities which entitle the invested with them, with a pre-eminence
above all other persons, so as they may not be spoken of with contempt, nor
touched with violence, because both anointed: and further for as much as these
holy fathers not knowing how to use honor when they had it without desert, and,
thereby ouerweighingly valuing their own worth at too high a rate, in the
erroneous opinion of their excellency, have fallen into presumptuous
comparisons, with both Prince and Priest as fiered in the ambitious mounts of
Phaetons Chariot, by contempt of all Ecclesiastical and monastical state,
together with Monks, Friars, Hermits, Cannons, Regular, secular Priests,
Doctors, Sorbonists, and other teachers, yea the very orders of all
Universities, which are not under them: the government of all Princes that
will not be ruled by them, the estate of all Nobles and Gentles of both sexes,
that will not follow them, and the public affairs of all commonwealths and
kingdoms, that will not yield them some special and peculiar, public or
private gain and commodity (just Templar-like in all things) and of all other
matters but especially in this point of superiority. Therefore you shall hear
how they give a reason of their ambitious aspires. They say forsooth they are
the chosen (what? Puritanes if any thing) illuminates: who for as much as they
have a more near familiarity with God, a more special grace and prerogative
given them: for government, and guiding of souls: and in all things a degree
of perfection above all other persons, be they secular or religious. Hereupon
it is (say they) that the honor point of superiority in place-taking, etc. is
given to them ex mirito and condigno. Which assertion if it were true, then
were the sequel tolerable. But because the titles of honor are derived from
God to man by participation of the divine attributes, whereof mercy and justice
being the chief, the former applied to Christ his eternal Priesthood, the
latter to his Regal power: therefore is it, that if a Jesuit or any other
person had as near, great, extraordinary, and often inward speech, conference
and familiarity with God, as ever had the Seraphicall Francis a more blessed
Saint, and in a higher place in heaven, as I verily believe, then any Jesuit is
as yet, or like to be hereafter, or as had blessed Saint Mary Magdalen, or
Saint Katherine of Seen, or sundry other blessed Saints: yet were he never to
be compared with the meanest Catholic Priest that lives on earth: If he go to
comparisons of nearness and familiarity with God, perfection of state, honor,
esteem and regard to be had of the person, and the like arrogant speeches
which the Jesuits use in arrogating that unto them, which none that loves them
but will blush to think of their extreme pride and vain glory grossly showed
therein.

Here I will tell you of one thing which I have observed, and often noted,
especially since these broiles began to be hot betwixt the secular Priests and
the Jesuits. Having conuersed and at sundry times been in company with diverse
sorts of people, of Nobles, Gentles, and other meaner persons, I never yet (to
speak in general terms) came in any place, but the more honorable or
generous blood the party, Lord or Lady, master or mistress was (and that
whether Catholic, Schismatike or Protestant, though in a different manner and
respect had in them) the more reverent regard had they always of Priests, and
used them with more peculiar esteem. And again, the baser, meaner, more rude,
uncivil, and low birth the parties were of, the less respect they had to any
Priest, Clergy, scholar, or other person o quality. Many such mean persons,
or but Gentlemen vntrial, having made me often remember old Pinny the Inkeeper
of Brodway in Sommersetshire, who would always have taken the highest place at
the upper end of the table, whosoever had been his guest: which though in some
sort his old age, and other circumstances might excuse him, A golden mean is
best in all thing for as the Northern Proverb 1. to saty seems not nor over
iolley dow not. It is an act of great humility, yea and of ciuility, at solemn
times, especially amongst a man's familiar friends, for to give good example to
others to be eue^ amongst his or her inferiors tanqua^ vnus ex illis, and
neither to strive for the last or first word, or place taking amongst not much
unequals, but rather wink at their rudeness, that will not give it them. Yet
when the honor of the person does concern not himself but the place or office
wherein he then is resident in public (and not private) amongst his friends,
or when the honor or worship deuoluted unto him by blood, creation,
consecration, anointing or other calling, is contemned or not acknowledged,
then is it a dastardly part, and a great iniuty offered by that Priest, or
other person to his order, house, office or calling, that shall suffer such an
indignity to pass uncontrolled, if he may help it. For herein we must note a
great difference betwixt accompanying our Savior to Jerusalem with Osanna, and
following him up mount Caluary, with crucifige, and by consequent howsoever we
suffer with patience to be dejected, and Priesthood abused by our adversary,
yet to permit every ordinary Gentleman, or any that is not a Knight (yea
coming as an Apostle, a Priest is spiritually Princely, and his title
honorable. But let that pass) if he be a Catholic, to take place above him
peremptorily, he may not without dishonor to his Priesthood, mary what he is to
do if the said Esquire or mean Gentleman, do rudely and contemptuously take
place before him (as many do:) Nay who of the Jesuits seditious faction does
esteem of any secular Priest more then of any ordinary seruingman, or so much
as of a base lay brother of their society) then herein and from henceforth the
matter being now called in question, he is not bound to resist until the party
may be made to know his duty, and justice had against him.
yet is the contrary course commended, and amongst civil Gentlemen, yea and
Nobles generally more used, viz. to place their guests (as strangers and their
friends) in their own house at table before them, unless they be far their
inferiors. And once being in company where were four secular Priests at
supper with a Noble person, a Lord of high renown, I noted that his Lordship
would not sit down until they all were set and placed before him, though it
was not their place, no not in his own house, so high to be exalted, but such
was his Noble mind, merrily jesting it out with these words, How he had heard
and seen it that Priests and women, had all the preheminences in the land of
peace, and especially the first in the Church above Princes, and both at the
table above all others their otherwise equals: but that in the field of war
Captains, Coronels and honorable soldiers went before them. But now that a
religious man, in respect that he is a religious man, should have or look for
a place of honor or pre-eminence amongst men, having by solemn vow renounced
all earthly honors and dignities, quite abandoned the company of all persons,
where states of honor or place-taking is of due right respected: and wholly
confined themselves to a private Cell, Cloister or Monastery, there to be
occupied only with their books and beads: for them to look for places as
the Jesuits do, it was never heard of before this day: religious persons
having no place indeed at all abroad in the world, because they have, or
should have, quite forsaken the world, and only in three times of public
assemblies, or affairs, they participate with the world, and yet therein with
the Ecclesiastical or secular only, not with the temporal state (whereunto
the Jesuits are more near incorporate by conversation practice and popular
life, then secular Priests themselves are: one is in time of solemn
processions, at which it has bin noted that the Jesuits will seldom or never
come, because say some who call them Theatins, they must take there the lowest
place, as inferior to other religious orders. Another is in time of general or
prouincial Counsel, where how they have shuffeled for place taking, is not so
openly known, because there has bin but one general Council since their order
first began: and then probably it being in the primitiues of their institutions
they had better, lowlier, and more religious spirits then now they have. Marry
notwithstanding for Prouincials: father Heywoods Council holden in Norfolk,
and father Westons contention in Wisbich, declares what spirit they have had
long agone, and daily more and more do smell of, in their humility for place
taking, yea, and in all other respects of honor, reverence and esteem in such
high Courts and Councels. The third and last is in times of Bishops
visitations: which of all things a Jesuit cannot endure to hear of to come
amongst them. And whereas all other religious orders do humbly obey their
Bishops, yield to their Su^mons, yea and seek to have visitations made amongst
them: the Jesuits quite contrary will acknowledge no superior but the Pope
only, no nor his Holiness neither if he anger them. Whereupon one of their
great Rabbis in time of the Bishops visitatio^ at Doway refused absolutely to
come at his Lordship upon summons or sending for him, alleging in plain
terms for his excuse, that he had a superior of his own order: that he
acknowledged no obedience due unto his honor: and that he would know his
generals will and pleasure therein, and then he would give him an answer. But
when the Bishop replied that both he and his General (if they lived within his
Diocese) should acknowledge an obedience unto him, or else get them both
packing thence, and that he would lay him fast by the heels if he were so
peremptory. Then forsooth this haughty Rabby crouched and humbled himself and
craved pardon of error.

Let no man take exceptions at this my speech, or think it needless to talk
of Jesuits, Priests, Prelates, and Bishops places, forseeing England is become
wild, Priesthood had in contempt, religion made but a matter of Atheall
policy: our gallants, swaggerers, and lusty Brutes, neglecting their duty to
God and man: and a company of new vpstart squibs, under color of zeal,
religion and holiness (fie fie) take upon them to ouertop, Pope, Prelate, and
Priest: it is high time, and very necessary as the times are, to put the
forgetful in mind, what things in times past have been, what God and his
Church exacteth at all our hands: what has been by pontifical and imperial
laws instituted, and heretofore by sundry Parliamentall acts and municipiall
laws of this land ordained. How by all laws, in all nations, and amongst all
professions, Priests, and such as bare that name amongst Jews, Pagans and
Christians, of what religion soever, were always had in highest esteem, save
only now brought in contempt by the Jesuits. Amongst the Egyptians, a Priest
was always next in honor, to a Pharoao: amongst the Caules, the Druides had
the renown: amongst the Britons three Archflamines, with thirty Flamines
supplied, the place of three Archbishops, and thirty Bishops throughout Logiers
Cambre: and Albanus (now England, Wales, and Scotland, with other Priests under
them. And sundry other Heathen nations had their Priests in stead of Princes,
as Kings to govern, as Presbiter John is at this present: and to this day the
high Courts of Parliament in England do consist by ancient custom of calling
to that honorable Court of the Lords spiritual and temporal, understood by
the Lords spiritual, the Archbishops and Bishops, as the most ancient invested
Barrons (and some of their Earls and others Graces) of this land, and
therefore always first in place next under our Sovereign King, Queen,
Emperor and Empress, Lord and Lady (for there is no difference of sex in
Regal Majesty.) This being so, and that by the laws Armoriall, Civil, and of
arms, a Priest his place in civil conversation is always before any Esquire,
There are 3. reasons of the contempt of Priests, one in that every Gentleman
of any reckening had his Chaplain in house with him and nimia familiaritas
parit contemptum, and an other in that some were but simple and unlearned
(god-wot) not knowing their own office nor the laities duty: and a third in
that many wanting patrimonies and means to live, were forced to sing placebo,
in applauding to all abuses. These were the causes of religious fall, and
Priesthoods dishonor, which all feel smart of, because all offended (both
Clergy and Laity) therein.
as being a Knights fellow by his holy orders: and the third of the three syrs,
which only were in request of old (no Barron, Vicount, Earl not Marquess
being then in use) to wit Sir King, Sir Knight, and sir Priest, this word
Dominus in Latin being a nowne substantive common to them all as Dominus meus
Rex, Dominus meus Ioab, Dominus Sacerdos, and afterward when honors began to
take their subordination one under another, and titles of princely dignity to
be hereditarie to succeeding posterity (which happened upon the fall of the
Roman Empire) then Dominus was in Latin applied to all noble and generous
hearts, even from the King to the meanest Priest or temporal person of gentle
blood, coate-armor perfect, and ancetry. But Sir in English was restraind to
these four, Sir Knight, Sir Priest, Sir Graduate, and in common speech Sir
Esquire: so as always since distinction of titles were, Sir Priest was ever
the second. And if a Priest or Graduate be a Doctor of Divinity or Preacher
allowed, then is his place before any ordinary Knight, if higher advanced and
authorized, then does his place allow him a congie with esteem to be had of
him accordingly.

Thus have all laws and legifers with great majesty, ordained a distinction of
place, regard, and esteem to be had of every person, though much neglected,
through both Priests and lay persons faults: that a decorum might be kept for
superiority on earth, as it is in heaven, and in all places unless in hell,
where nullus ordo sed sempiternus horror inhabitat: and amongst Jesuits and
Puritanes, who seek quite to alter, change and innouate, or quite to take away
all both Ecclesiastical and temporal orders, laws, honors, and ancient
decrees in all things. Which by so much the more for the honor of Priesthood
and learning (wherein the first and chief rise of dignity does consist,
because that all true honor and renown rises at first from pens, or pikes,
learning or chivalry, Priesthood or Knighthood,) every Priest, Prelate, lay
person, or other of any talent, knowledge or ability ought to defend: by how
much the same is had in contempt, either of ignorance or malice, and may be
avoided. But enough of this matter: now to another.

THE II. ARTICLE.
I can never wonder enough in my mind at these men that will take upon them a
^^^e of per^^^^ion above all other^: which state, if a ^^n look into it (...)
search it from top to toe, among t them all f^esh ^ll not si^^a perfect peace
in ^^ ^ll, but it is either ^^^^ed or broken, or has one point or other m^^
that mishapeth it most notoriously, a^ an e^e-so^e to all that behold it: For
whereas the question is indeed amongst divines whether an active or a
conte^platiue life be more perfect (and h^^e note that we speak of active and
contemplative, as they both respect the church, the one in an Ecclesiastical
the other in a Monastical state, as much to say, as whether S. P^ter or S John
were to God more near for though ^t be said of Saint Marie Magdalen: and
applied by (...) unto our blessed Lady, that optima^ partem elegit, yet was it
by way of comparison with Marthaes life, which was an active or practical life
me^tel^ temporal and therewithal very commendable and good, but yet not to be
compared with an active Ecclesiastical which includes both practiue and
speculatiue life in it, as Saint Peter did) of these two is the question:
whether as the worthier. And the common opinion of divines being this, that in
some sense the contemplative life compared to the Seraphines exercise in all
spiritual love delights is the ch^efest and most perfect as the Seraphines are
the highest order of Angels and in some other respect the active life compared
to the Cherubins as their exercise consists in an act of the understanding and
knowledge of things in God alone, appropriated to these holy Angels of the
second order is perfect^^ then that again, another way concluding that as
visiobeatisica or eternal beatitude consists and in intelligendo intellectu
and in amando velutate Deum, so where both active and contemplative life are
joined in one person abstracted from all worldly or temporal actions, there
and in that party must needs be a pre-eminence of perfection, above either the
one o the other apart. In regard whereof there never was any doubt made, but
that Saint Peter having both his understanding and w^ll occupied in knowledge
and love of his Lord and master above the rest: and withal thereupon tending
in all his actions to both states of active and contemplative life, he was of,
and in a more perfect state and way to perfection ^hen Saint John was, though
both of them exercised both these lives: and Saint John more prope ly said to
be of a contemplative, and Saint Peter of an active life. But now for the
Jesuits, they will have and take upon them the name of religious: that is, of a
contemplative life, and withal will not endure to be called seculars: and yet
take upon them a secular state of life which is active. And further, accompany
Martha rather then Mary in all things which are mere temporal. And so to
conclude, they are neither actiues, nor contemplatiues: neither have they the
perfection of any of all the 3. states Ecclesiastical, monastical or
temporal in any of their actions.
Whether any other order goes before these Jesuits in perfection of life, and
security of state or no?

THE ANSWER.
THeir profession is most imperfect, their life is most popular, and their
state most vnsecure, and dangerous of any others in all the world this day, as
now they use it. And to speak of perfection when it was at the best, and
therefore at highest rate amongst them, wherein should their perfection
consist, that it should be so far and high in esteem, above the same kind of
perfection (vtcunque) in other religeous orders? First, they do not keep their
hours, in vigilijs multis, rising either at midnight, cocke-crow, or other
extraordinary times, as all other religeous persons do. Secondly, they do not
keep four, nor two, nor one Lent in the year (much less do they fast the
whole year through, or all their whole life time, as sundry do, some more,
some less, in other religeous orders) nor use any other kind of fast, or
abstinence more then other secular Priests, yea and all the whole Catholic
laity do. Thirdly, they do not continually wear haire-cloth, go barefooted,
refrain the use of any linen and soft bed: as many religeous, yea, almost all
do most of these things. Fourthly, they never use any contemptible apparel, or
other means to occasionate a contempt to be had of themselves in their own
naked hearts: more then any other Ecclesiastical or temporal person does.
Fifthly, they embrace no poverty more then any, and not so much as many
religeous orders do: For who has half that wealth that the Jesuits have,
which they will get by hook or by crook, one way or other: as hereafter shall
be showed. Sixthly, they are not confined to their Cells, Cloisters, or
Colleges. For they will be stark mad to have their houses staind with the
name of Monastical places, as other religious orders are: but have scope to go
and live where and how they list, as much as students have in any University
in Christendom, and far more then they will allow to the poor prisoners at
Wishich, or to students at home, or other places where the Seminary, and
secular Priests live under them, and therefore rightly called their prisoners,
as kept so straightly that they may not recreate themselves together, nor two
of them have any speech or conference without a third, with many like Turkish
cruelties, which these tyrants use against the English Priests, whilst they
live in all iollitie, wealth and pleasure themselves there: as in all other
books and Apologies you may find set out at large of that matter. Seventhly,
they profess no continual silence nor solitary life, as sundry religeous
do, and keep it most strictly: thinking it a death to come forth of their
Cells, and Cloisters, into the world to have any speech, meddling or sight of any
worldly thing. But they quite contrary profess such a popularity,
secularitie, temporalitie, and all mundane kind of life and meddling in worldly
affairs, as wonder it is how ever they have time to think of God or any good
Saint. Eighthly, they profess neither chastity nor yet obedience, more then
any other religious order does: yea no more in very deed (their manner of
performing obedience to their superior considered) then every secular Priest
does. And if a man go to the ways and means of performance of this their vow
of chastity and obedience, it is far inferior and more imperfect,
uncertain and dangerous in them, then in any or the most part of other
religious orders. Ninthly, if their perfection consist in this: that they
labor in preaching, teaching, conversion of souls, ministering of Sacraments,
managing of causes, with Princes and civil persons, and therefore as divines
say (quia maius est illuminare quam illuminari:) so they affirm that they have
taken a state of most perfection that way upon them (and indeed they take so
much upon them in that behalf, as they seem to arrogate an Apostolical power
and authority reserved to themselves alone, therein speaking it in plain
terms, that the seculars ought not to meddle in such affairs, but content
themselves like silly simple men, with hearing confessions at most, or only
saying of Mass, for as for confessions I wis they will not with their
good-wils permit that a secular Priest should take the confessions of any:
unless it be of mean persons and poor folks, where no gain nor commodity
is to be had but at Gods hand only: yet by these worshipful Rabbis leaves,
if they usurp secular Priests places and authority, and thereupon challenge a
degree of perfection unto them, before and above all other, then would I know
from whence they have that gift to illuminate, and power and authority of
preaching, teaching, hearing confessions, and other like Ecclesiastical
jurisdictions.

For as for their managing of Civil and Martial causes, as invasion of
kingdoms, raising of rebellions, defamation of Princes, and bringing all into
a popular contempt, that are not themselves or dependent on them, and the like
absurd^ties as they have received no such commission from God nor his Church,
but directly from the common enemy of mankind, as suggested by him, and after
bred in their itching, ambicious idle working brains, so no secular will wish,
seek, or accept of that their seditious turbulent and bloody office (unfit of
all other for Priests to deal in) out of their hands. It is therefore of the
former Ecclesiastical jurisdictions and lawful authorities, whereof I speak,
and would know from whence and of whom they have them. Either they must have
them immediately from God, or else from man.

To say they have them immediately from God, I think they will not: but yet if
they dare say so (as who can tell what giddy heads puffed up with swelling
pride, impudency and insolency will say or do, when it stands the^ upon to stand
to their tacklings, or else have all their followers and disciples forsake
them:) then first it will be demanded per qua^ regulam do they prove it?
Secondly, what testimony or witness have they for it? Thirdly, how, when and
in what place was this new institution of Ecclesiastiques promise granted,
confirmed and ratified? Fourthly, by what sign, toke^, wonder or miracle shall
we know it is from God immediately: for miracles we must have, for confirmations
of all new doctrine and approbation of ancient Catholic traditions, customs
and orders? Thirdly, what manner of man, vbi gentium, where was he borne, whose
son was he, where and how was he brought up, how lived he, how died he, that
was the first author or illuminate of this innovation and change? Sixthly and
last of all, after all these things are examined and known, and that with
help of an Aesopian fable, they can bring us into a conceit of a Lucean Tower
to be firmly built in the imaginatiue horescope of their wandering zodiac:
yet will they all be proved by this means to be flat forerunners of
Antichrist, and Archinuenters of new Puratinisme, worse then ever yet was heard
of: or else made to do public penance throughout all Churches in
Christendom, confessing before the whole world (as I pray God grant them
grace, humility and patience to do it) what blind guides and seducers of
innocent hearts, they have been: leading many souls into eminent danger of
perdition, by arrogating to to much unto themselves, etc.

Again if they say they have this authority, and by consequent are in state of
perfection above the seculars by institution and gift of and from the Pope his
Holiness and Sea Apostolic: then it will be replied by necessary sequel upon
them. First, that the Pope himself must needs be thereby of a more perfect
life then they are, which in no wise they will yield unto: yea arrogating an
extraordinary familiarity with God, to be due to them alone, and a kind of
impossibility of error in their Synodall consultations, called under and by
their General: their special prerogative and means to bring any one to
perfection (they are so far from yielding or granting it, at least equally
with them) to his Holiness is such, as they have preached openly in Spain
against Pope Sixtus the last of all holy memory, and railing against him as
against a most wicked man and monster on earth: they have called him a Lutheran
heretic, they have termed him a wolf, they have said he had undone all
Christendom if he had lived: and in few, Card. Bellarmine himself, as Judge
Paramount, being asked what he thought of his death, answered: Qui sine
paenitentia viuit and sine paenitentia moritur, proculdubio ad infernum
descendit: and to an English Doctor of our nation, he said: Conceptis verbis,
quantum capio, quantum sapio, quantum intelligo descendit ad infernum. Well let
this pass as a comfort to seculars to be full of imperfections, and as
unworthy creatures to be justly censured of by these worthy perfectiues, that
dare judge their chief Pastor: which no sacred Sinode, nor OEcumenicall
Council, either would, either durst ever have done so before them. Secondly, if
these new illuminates take their perfection from this principle, Quia maius est
illuminare qua^ illuminari, then must they by necessary sequel herein, also
be pleased to hear it, that maius est dare quam accipere: and therefore if the
State Ecclesiastical and secular Clergy give them this authority, whereby
they come to this peerless perfection a fortiori: yet still the secular
Prelates as the giuers thereof, must be before the^ in that degree of
perfection. Thirdly, in order of perfections, this has ever been an ancient
Canonical observation and rule of none denied: that any religious person may
pass into an other order of religion, that is stricter then his own is,
whereunto he has vowed himself, at the first intending therein to live and
dye; and all this in regard that the said stricter order is holden to be a
state of more perfection, and nearer familiarity or intercourse with God and
his holy Angels, and Saints. But now admit the Jesuits order, or rather
society (for they are such strange men, as all must consist of innouations,
novelties, and new names amongst them) were so strict, as in regard of this
point of perfection, none might pass out of their society into any other
religious order: yet as out of all other religious orders, there have passed
some in all ages to take secular charge, and curam animarum upon them, so also
out of the Jesuits society, there have passed diverse that have been
Cardinals, etc. And if they deny Cardinals to be seculars, or to take charge
of souls upon them: once I am sure they are not Monastical, and by
consequent, the farther secluded from seculars or ecclesiastiques, the more
temporal and laicall must needs their lives be. But yet seeing all this
notwithstanding they may come out of the society to be Cardinals, and then a
fortiori to be Bishops, or other Prelates and Pastors more directly taking curam
animarum upon them, it follows that always their state of perfection is
inferior to the secular. Fourthly, that thing wherein the merit is either
counted greater in seeking for it, or in accepting of it being offered, or the
sin greater in neglecting to take it, or refusal being commanded; is ever
of more perfection then any other wanting those circumstances. But as no man is
bound, neither may he leave his Bishopric, or other pastoral office void
without dispensation of his superior. So on the contrary, any religious
person, Jesuit or other may lawfully, yea and oftentimes is bound to leave his
Cell, Cloister, or College, (though by his departure the doors must, and may
be shut up for any coming there ever after) and take curam animarum upon him,
Vtpote quia is qui episcopatum desiderat bonum opus desiderat, etc. Et bonum
(vt supra dixi) quo communis eo melius. Therefore still is a secular life of
more perfection then a religious, by that principle of illuminating others.
Fifthly, if they urge their perfection of life, by illuminating of souls to
consist of this: that it is done under obedience to their superior: which
virtue of obedience being in holy Scripture prophetically defined, to be better
then sacrifice; it follows that of all other signs of perfection, Christian
renuntiation, mortification and denying of themselves, this is the greatest,
most manifest and chief: in that by reason hereof, be they never so well
settled to their content, wish and desire, having all things that may please or
delight them, and freed, preserved and defended from all things that may molest
them: yet must they keep such a strait hand, and strait watch over their will
and all their senses continually, as volens nolens their will must not be
theirs, but their superiors, to go or run thence in change of a thought, or
turn of a hand, and repair out of England, or other Northern region into
Ethiope, Egypt or India: or else wheresoever they shall be commanded, yea
though it be morally certain they shall never come thither, or else there to
be murdered or slain. And this is the point indeed whereupon they stand as a
precious mirror of all perfection, and attributed to their society alone. To
which I answer first, that I could wish with all my heart, (and so could many
thousands in England wish the like) that their obedience were tried, and
themselves mortified to perfection, above all seculars in their quiet departure
out of this land, and go and live where they list afterward, according as they
and their superiors shall think fittest for them, to make this their state of
perfection secure. But I doubt if they should by never so powerable authority
be called out hence; yea if it were from his Holiness, they would call him a
Protestant for so doing, as now they do all seculars or others that wish it,
both for their own, and the general good, quiet and security of our Prince,
country, present State, and all Catholics in general borne under English
allegiance. And again if they should be thrust out and expelled by force, as
like enough they are to be so by some sudden uproar and rebellion, or invasion
procured by them: as a Gent. of the Spanish faction, and an entire friend and
follower of one Father Ouldcorne, seemed to say no less of late: vz. That
these contentions must end with blood: and I verily believe he said true: blood
must and will end it indeed, if they be not thrust out in time: but cursed be
these bloody massacrers that are the procurers of it. Then doubt I on the
other side these perfectly mortified ghostes, will be so far out of patience,
as they will loose all their merit without recovery: and the rather am I so
persuaded, by reason of the great murmuring sorrow, execrations and curses they
used so pathetically, passionatly, and extreme outragiously against the King
of France and his honorable Council, for expelling them thence,
notwithstanding their lives were all in his hands: so that whereas he might
justly have put them all to death for traitors, arrested upon high treason, yet
granting them their lives gratis, and also giving of them three French crowns
a piece, with a certain time of leave to provide for themselves to depart:
they most ungrateful of all other (a vice, to be plain with you, which is
generally noted in them all as a native branch, proper to Nicke Machiuels
crew, never to be thankful longer, then they are in hope of a greater benefit
thereby) forgetting, or rather not any way acknowledging any benefit, mercy
or lenity: but all extremity, tyranny and cruelty showed toward them by
the King, fell into such terms of malicious speeches against his Christian
Majesty: as some English Priests being the^ in the low Countries, and confines
of France at the time of their expulsion, did note and report unto me in verbo
sacerdotis that the common people hearing it, and how vehemently they spoke
against the peace then in hand betwixt these two potent Kings Christian and
Catholic, did verily think they would have pulled them down and stoned them
in the street.

Thus you see what perfection these mortified men are come unto, and whereunto
their ostentation of obedience to their superior does tend. Obedience indeed is
a special virtue, but one swallow makes no Summer: one virtue makes no
creature perfect in his life, one only defect makes a privation, but all
helps must concur to every perfection. Vnitas est principium numeri, sed
vnus vel vnitas non est numerus nisi abusiue sumptus. The five foolish virgins
they did watch, they lived chaste, they were obedient, they were diligent, they
were careful, they carried lamps with them, burning with indiscreet fire of
zeal, but they wanted oil of charity to keep in the heat and make it
perfect: and therefore were they rejected with nescio vos. Well: yet admit this
obedience of the Jesuits to wear the garland of perfection and merit the
crown of glory, what then? Is there none has equal part with them, or may
none be as perfect as any of them by this same means? Yes questionless. Saint
Augustine our Apostle was sent by Pope Gregory (surnamed the Great for his
many rare excellencies and graces) into this flourishing Isle of England nolens
volens, with command not to return until he had converted this people and
nation to the Christian faith, or else lost his life in defense of the same.
And he came by virtue of his Holiness command: and under obedience worthily
performed the same to his great merit. How many Monks and Friars, and other
both secular and religious persons, have gone, and do go continually with like
authority when occasion is offered, and under the same vow of obedience which
these Jesuits make their vaunt of? It were too long to stand to number them,
with what authority, and under what other obedience (unless a more perfect
kind) do Seminary Priests come into England, save only this alone? Where is
then the difference of this great perfection which is in the Jesuits above all
other Priests or orders of religion? Where it is I know not: but where the
contrary is I can give a shrewd guess at it. It was said of old: Cucullus non
facit monachum. It is not the death but the cause that makes a Martyr. And we
say now, that meat makes, and cloth shapes, and manners makes a man: and that
all these fair shows and flourishes in Academicall virtues, may be without
impeachment in their causes, and yet stark naught in the effects produced by
them. And because says the Philosopher that ex effectibus cognoscitur causa:
therefore by demonstration a posteriori it will be proved, that the Jesuits
state of perfection is stark stinking naught, and their ostentation of
obedience mere hypocrisy, and a seditious arrogant, vaineglorious deluding of
simple people with their vsurpate authority. Is it always a virtue and merit
in those qui trans mare currunt to hazard their lives in foreign lands, going
either voluntary or under obedience by command of their Superior? If the
Jesuits say it is not, (as it is not indeed) then it follows that they must
grant, O that men would but give now and then an impartial glaunce upon the
Iesiu s protects and principles of their absurdities, then should they see it
luce clarius, th^^ they ab^^e every virtue, grace and mean left us to work
our salvation by, cum ^^more tremore, and simplicitate cordis: who does or can
deny, but that the three Evangelical virtues of chastity, poverty and
o^e^ience are of counsel only not of precept, a in the Gospel; and of precept
not of counsel after a vow (...) God has past of them, and yet ^oth w^ies
they (...) be and are often abus d to ^u^ll e^^^^^s ap^ ^e^^ ^^^^ne in (...)
se^^^ ^^^^ons that (...).
it is the intention not the action that occasioneth the merit. In respect
whereof we say (and true it is by general opinion of all men) that two
Christians going into the wars together against the Turk, and both of them
there slain, the one may die a blessed martyr, the other be damned to hell
without redemption: and then by consequent, they must needs grant that though
the cause seem never so just yet the intention may mar all: and that that
which is known only to God alone during the time of hanging the same cause, the
same is known to man after the effects have discovered it. And so their
ostentation of mortification, obedience, perfection of state, and I know not
what is in policy by them to be kept silent: for burst it out once into the
effects, it will prove nothing but avarice, extorsion, cousinage, treachery and
treason. If they affirm (which were gross) that the very act of going under
obedience be meritorious, and makes the habituated therewith perfect: then I
infer that upon such a generality, Mithridates filling all the Adriaticke
seas with Pirates, to molest the Roman Nauies, and to break their forces, did
cause a high merit to redound by that act to his courageous soldiers: (for
fear makes cowards courageous in extremities) though questionless many of
them went for obedience, which had rather have wished themselves half hanged
to have sit still at home, and slept in a sound skin amongst their wives and
children. So a merchants factor going by commandment of his master into
Turkey, Barbary, Persia or elsewhere, committing himself to Neptunus mercy,
to winds and waves, and all adverse fortunes of sea and land: yet because those
that are bound they must obey, and perhaps though unwilling to have taken that
voyage in hand of himself: yet going on his master his cost and charges, he
takes it upon him with great alacrity and joy of mind: and by consequent
meriteth greatly thereby, if this principle hold true with the Jesuits. And a
number of the like examples may be brought to show their gross error, or
rather the fond opinion of many, that think upon their inueigling persuasions,
that a Jesuit has taken upon him the most perfect state and vocation of life,
of any other whosoever. Whereas in very deed it is (especially as now they use
it,) the most imperfect of all other, a very platform, canuase, and devise how
to strengthen and enrich themselves with wealth, friends, and insinuating of
themselves into Princes Courts and affairs; and thus (forsooth) for obedience
sake these humble souls, must pass into India, Turkey, England, Scotland, and
all nations, and be removed, sent for, and posted ever (like merchants indeed
that traffic where most gain is to be made by interchaunging of merchandise,
from one Mart, haven, promontorie, or Monopole to another) and so another sent
in his place thither again, or perhaps none at all if no commodity be to be
reaped thereby: either by holding in of some friends that would slip from them,
or else by means of giving intelligences of affairs in those coasts
necessary to be made known. And thus much for these pure Jesuits perfections,
that bring all the world into admiration of their Pharisaical holiness and
Scribisticall zeal and religion.

THE III. ARTICLE.
Whether, seeing the Jesuits are of so bad, imperfect and corrupt a life, is
their society a confirmed order of religion: or else is it a secular or
ecclesiastical state of life, or otherwise a mere temporal profession of
companionship (as the word society imports) or none at all: or what is it?

THE ANSWER.
IT is (as I have told you before enough for that matter) a very hotch potch of
al together, their founders principles, (which were good in the original)
being quite perverted, corrupted, and altered by them in the execution and
practice. For as you may gather clearly out of the last Quodlibet: they are
neither secular, nor religious, and yet they will be counted the latter in
name, and will be of themselves the former: nay more then the former in action.
Insomuch as to the great discredit of their society, and the reverend esteem
had at the first of them, they run now such a desperate course, as if
religion were but a mere political and Atheall devise, or practical science
invented by fig-boyes, and men of the Bernard high law, and such like as live
by their wits and principles of Machiauell, taught by their Arch-Rabbies how to
maintain with equivocations, dissimulation, detraction, ambition, sedition,
contention, surfeiting sorer then ever did Heliogabalus (with his many hundred
varieties of services, served in at every banquet, or feast royal at his
Table) in setting division, breeding of jealousy, and making of hostile strife
by opposition of King against King, State against State, (...) the (...) are
(...) f lowes ^^^cap or wnes, to ^^^^on ^^ngdom, and to (...) Kin^^ with
P^mphlets in then ambi ious hearts. And wh^ is it they cannot do with f^cing
aloof of, but come it once to ^^ysting, they are gone. So in their great
ostent^tion of learning, when the secular, challenged or rather entreated a
disp^^ation to be had about schism, they durst not come to the encounter, but
like cowards and scolds ^ailed against of for moving of such a matter.
Priest against Priest, Peer against Peer, parents against children, sisters
against brothers, children against parents, servants against masters, wives
against husbands, hu^bands against wives, and one friend against another:
raising of rebellions, murdering of Princes, making vprores every where,
until they make those they cannot win otherwise unto them, either yield to
be their vassals for to live quiet by the, or force them to flight, or drive
them out of their wits, or otherwise plague them to death. Are these men then
to be called religious: nay are they to be called seculars or Ecclesiastickes?
Nay are they worthy the name of Catholic laity, nay of temporal worldly
Mechanical Christians? No, no, their course of life does show what their study
is: and that howsoever they boast of their perfections, holiness, meditations
and exercises (whereof we will talk anon) yet their platform is heathenish,
tyrannical, Sathanicall, and able to set Aretine, Lucian, Machiauell, yea and
Don Lucifer in a sort to school, as impossible for him by all the art he has
to besot men as they do: as is most manifest by this only contention betwixt
the seculars and them, if there were none other proof. For could the foul
feend himself, or all the infernal furies have put such an odious conceit
into Catholics heads and hearts against their own ghostly Fathers and dear
friends, as these worse then wicked spirits have done? Could the Devil with
all the art he has, have made the laity to have condemned and contemned the
seculars, and with whoups and howbubs made all the world ring of them, as of
disobedient, irreligious Publicanes, and Schismatikes, for not subscribing to
the Archpriest at their beck and command a full half year before ever he had
any authority: It is marvelous to think of this ^^nding impudenc^^ of the
Jesuits, in establishing of then Archpriest, and what shameful and graceless
shifts they are driven vnt^, or ^^^her v^^untarily fallen into, for defense of
their intolerable wickedness, and abuse of all estates therein. Amongst
others, of which bald shifts, this is one, and a chief, to blind the ignorant
withal. For that the Pope having now confirmed the Archpriests authority,
al^hough it were unlawfully gotten, and that he shows himself partial,
unfit and too cruel therein: yet now, all men ought to obey it, and may no way
speak against it: yea if he excommunicate, suspend, etc. unjustly, or
whatsoever he do else, yet being in authority he ought to be obeyed: and those
whom he so censureth to be avoided. And thus these ignorant see not, how that
by this means, murders, treasons, blasphemies, usurpations, extorsions,
cousinage, heresy, or whatsoever vice or villainy is committed by any inferior
officer, may not be complained on to a superior. But that an excommunication
passing from such a gross usurper, is still of force, be there cause or no
cause for it.
they all this while keeping silence, and bearing all their reproaches with
patience? And then again when a forged foisted in authority was gotten by
cousinage and cogging most egregiously with his Holiness, and so the grant to
none effect: yet the seculars willing to put all up quietly, and rest with the
loss and taking away of their good names, which was dearer to them then their
lives. But not permitted to live so: they being of fresh tormented again by
these most turbulent and malicious men, and urged to make a kind of recantation
or satisfaction by way of public penance, with repentance of not yielding at
the first and acknowledging they were in schism: could then all the feends in
hell have driven into peoples minds a conceit of scandale, or any other offense
to have been given or committed by the seculars, for either appealing to his
Holiness for justice against these tyrants in their just defense, and to have
the cause tried there betwixt them: or for setting out books to declare and
make known to the world what these wretched men were, and how mightily both
the seculars were injured, and all others deluded by them? No, it had been
impossible for any wicked spirit to have dealt so maliciously: and yet have
persuaded the people that the seculars were still in the fault, and the Jesuit
innocent lambs, Saints, and free. And yet this have these Machiuileans done,
and banded it out most impudently: yea, so far as notwithstanding the
discovery of their high impiety by books and other means, yet will the
people still believe them in every thing. They will believe that the seculars
in time of their long silence did yet deserve to be railed upon, contemned and
reviled as they were. They will believe that their now writing in their own
just defense, and setting out (but in part) as they have deserved, is odious,
scandalous, and very evil done of them. So as both silence and speech
condemns them: and all this by a cogging trick of Machiauell to serve his
own turn withal. They will believe that the Archpriests authority once had
can never be lost again, be it from God or the Devil, at the first grant
made unto him by forgerie, cousinage, or false play, by deluding of the Popes
Holiness, prejudice of the Sea Apostolic, contempt of Priesthood, praemunire
incurred against her Majesty, with treason to her Royal person, Crown and
State, and by all abuses that may be (as he has committed many since, and
those such as the authority he had is lost by them) or by any other means.
They will believe that he (this Archpriest) and the Jesuits have still their
authorities, and are not excommunicated, suspended, etc. as they are in very
deed by their cursed proceedings, most unjustly and injuriously against the
innocent, and in taking upon them matters above their reach, by usurping his
Holiness place and authority. They will still believe and follow these
Saintly men, make no scruple to come at Service, and to Sacraments with them:
notwithstanding that by all these Quodlibets past and to come, they may see
what a dangerous, desperate and damnable race they run, and all those that
follow them. They will still believe for all this, that the seculars are
excommunicated and suspended, etc. by the Archpriest, and that he had and has
power to do it: and therefore will they still make scruple to come at any of
them to confession or other sacrament, notwithstanding that neither will nor
dare, the Archpriest or Jesuits avouch it openly, but in hucker mucker:
neither their brokers and trumpeters stand to it publicly.

In few: if this will not resolve the laity, and move them to join with the
seculars as a parcel of their own corporation and common body political,
that must stick to them, when the other (I mean the Jesuits) as a private
corporation and body of it self, will be far to seek, at least for any
help or succor yielding to them, further then will stand for their own
private gain and commodity: but if quite contrary they will still run
against the stream, and believe that black is white, chalk cheese, new
sectaries, saints: and religious men seculars, or rather controllers of
seculars: then can I say no more, but new doctrine, new faith, new masters,
new scholars: new fathers, new children, and all in the end new, etc. and
there I leave it.

THE IIII ARTICLE.
WHether any go before the Jesuits in political government, prudence, etc. or
not?

THE ANSWER.
LIke as in all true Heroical, moral, Cardinal, yea or Theological virtues in
general, there are many thousands go beyond the^: so in true prudence in
special, and by consequent in political government as it is a branch
deriuatiue from prudence many do excel them, throughout the Christian world
every where. Marry take policy as it is now a days taken by common phrase of
speech, in the subject wherein it is inhaerent: as we say that a right
Politician is a very Machiauell, a very Machiauell is an upright Atheist, and
an upright Atheist, is a downeright dastardly coward, void of all religion,
reason, or honesty: so by consquent it may be said, that in political
government, or Machiuilcan policy none goes beyond the Jesuits at this day.
For the better understanding whereof I will here set you down some of their
sleights and devises, how they deal to become great, and to have government
and charge of others committed unto them: and all this by the fame and report
that goes of them by admiration, cunningly gotten to be had of them and their
doings in all things.

A though sundry (...) ^he seculars might have had ^^a^ple f^cul^^^s for
hallowing (...) Ch^lices, dis^en^^^^ons, etc. as any Ie uit ever ^^d or h^^h:
yet (...) king humbly (...) he^ vocation, and co^^nti^g t^^ms^lues with such
faculties as might extend to the absolution of any sin^e, and delivery of any
penitent soul out of the power of the Di^ell (which authority the meanest
Priest has as well as the mightiest Rabbie of the Jesuitical order) they
little the ^me^ of the inconveniences that would come of these newly enlarged
faculties, that the Jesuits at the first entrance came withal, as having cast
their plot before hand how to win f^me, and m^ke themselves admi^ed a^ of the
English: a (...) ^^t to cea^e of every novelty. Neither did the seculars then
consider what was spok^^ ^b^oad of the Jesuits: not yet remembered the Cardinals
words, that the Jesuits would prove but thorns in the se^^^^ sides: and be
cause of great troubles amongst them. So great was their charitable oversight,
in not opposing the^sel^^^ (...)iu^t these ^harisees (...) the first: or
seeking to have them called out of this land: but it was for our sins that
(...) we^e thus bewitched with them.
Their first devise then is, to get a report to go amongst the people of them,
to be the rarest men for learning, wisdom, virtue and government that are in
all the world in this age to be found. Which opinion to confirm, they cunningly
obtained extraordinary faculties, for hallowing of Chalices, etc. and after
that they got a report to go, that for their familiarity and nearenesse to God
to obtain their suit in all their need^: they are (and must needs be) endued
with a special spirit for guiding of souls which the seculars want.

2 To second this withal, a secret admonition must be given, to warn all
Catholics to take diligent heed to beware of all Priests in general, how
they come at any Sacraments with them, at extraordinary times of making
general, annual, or quarterly confessions (but weekly or monthly only)
unless they be either Jesuits, or such as are correspondents unto the^, as
wholly advised, guided, and ruled by them in all their proceedings.

3 This foundation thus laid, then to huffe and ruff it out, a Council of
women must be called to set cock ahoope: and these of nature being as flexible
to yield, as credulous to believe, and as prone to virtue or vice upon any
sudden motion, as forward, dutiful, and truly deuote, and timorous in doing
any thing, otherwise then those that are their spiritual guides do move them
unto: must be the chief factors for them a while: as those known to be potent
in moving either to contemn or esteem whosoever they will have advanced or
disgraced.

4 Having first got in a foot, and after the whole body by this peecemeale
means into any court or country, then must there be a devise to get a
residence for some principal man amongst them (who how unfit soever) yet shall
he be commended for a sans peer without comparison: to remain in the Princes
court, or with some special man or woman of mark, who may give him best
intelligence of all things that pass or are done there. And by this device
there are few or no Kings Courts in Europe, or of Christendom this day, where
some of their intelligents do not reside, of purpose to receive and give
intelligence unto their General at Rome, of all the occurrents in these parts
of the world: which they dispatch to and fro by such secret ciphers as are to
themselves best, and commonly but only to them known. So as nothing is done
in England, but it is known in Rome within a month after at least, and reply
made back as occasion is offered.

5 Having thus established a Council almost in every Princes Court, where the
president or chief agent, or intelligent must always be a Jesuit in re or in
spe, and action to discover, propter bonum not Reipublicae, but rei priuatae
societatis without all scruple, to them the secrets of their Soueraigns, to
their uttermost knowledge, though with the consequent overthrow of their own
native Prince, country and all: as their prodigious, and more then heathenish
practices in France, to have lifted the Spaniard into that throne and kingdom,
to their perpetual shame and reproach (all Christendom ringing of those their
unnatural treasons against their own natural Country) does make it
manifest: (to omit or refer over to another place, what and how spitefully,
traitorously, and irreligiously they have dealt against England, and our
Soueraign Lady and Queen.) Then follows another shift for managing of their
actions: which is, that if (as often it has so happened) their treasons and
trecheries be discovered, either by intercepting of their letters, and the
mysteries therein (vtcunque) made known, or apprehension of their messengers,
or some of their inferior intelligents, then (to calumniate, deny and falsify
all the actions and proceedings of the Council and State very iudicially,
publicly, and apparently against them) they either pretend that the parties
confessed such things by constraint of tortures, or that it was a plot of the
State, to make all Catholics odious, whereas in deed they make us odious by
this means to the State and all: as being all thought guilty of their
conspiracies, because they know not how to put a distinction or difference in
these tamperings amongst us.

This calumniation must be seconded for a shift with a like unto it, which they
call a lawful equivocation: and herein though there be no question to be made
of it, but that in some sense it may be lawful: as for example: if a Judge or
other civil magistrate, appointed to sit in Commission upon a matter of fact,
should examine in matter of law not pertaining to that purpose: or being of one
and the self same kind in specie, yet no way pertinent to the knowledge or
true information of the matter there to be examined: so as if the question be,
(which is common) whether such a one being a Catholic have ever heard it
preached or taught, that it was lawful for a subject to lay violent hands upon
his Sovereign or not: and now the Judge in examining this party, asks him
whether he know any Seminary priest, or were ever at Mass or confession, By
the evil taught lesson of equivocation, one M. James Standish a Jesuit priest
abused his Holiness: when being a^ked whether the matter proponed by him, for
setting up the new Hierarchy, was done by all the rest of the Priests consents
in England or not: he answered (but very falsl^, for sc^^ce one of the
se^^^l^^: in England in respect of the wh^le nu^b^r knew of it) that it was:
reserving to himself (as since poor ignorant m^n not considering what he did
to lie to his Holiness, he has confessed) this part, viz. as I presuppose or
presume, etc. Just like whereunto may be interpreted Card. Caietanes letters
for estabshing M. Blackwel Archpresbiter: who having by Parsons and Garnets
cousinage, got a long Catalogue of names out of England, exhibited to his Grace
for election of M Blackwell, etc. his Lordship affirmed in the said letter,
that it was by general consent of most Priests in England being abused indeed
with names taken here for one purpose, and given up there for another: the
parties altogether ignorant of what was intended, and the Jesuits excusing the
matter, upon the aforesaid equivocate presupposition, scil. that all would like
of it.
etc. or no. To this he were no way bound to answer, but might absolutely deny
it, because it is as a thing impertinent to his place and office at that time,
and makes neither here nor there for coming to the knowledge of this article,
scil. whether it be lawful to kill an anointed Queen or no. But now if the
case be proposed, and the examination made of such articles as may either
directly or indirectly boult out and make known the truth of the matter
intended, and then of due right to be examined: then and therein equivocation
is but a mere device of perjury, cogging and lying. As for example: what say
you (says the Magistrate) if the Pope come in with hostile hand to invade this
Realm, thereby to set up the Catholics religion: whose part will you take,
etc? and the Catholic answers, I will take the Queens part: meaning to
himself, if the Pope will command me so to do: or for any thing further of my
mind that you shall know. This I say is wicked cogging and unlawful, as being
nothing else but a secret concealed treason. It being sure that invasion,
hostile power and force of arms do denotate a population of the whole land,
and no restoring (but per accidens only) of religion, or the Catholic faith at
all. And therefore as every Catholic in England is bound in that respect to
defend his Prince and country against all foreign invasion of King, Pope, or
whosoever else shall come in with hostile hand, under what pretense soever, as
hereafter shall be proved: so ought the party examined to answer absolutely
without al doubling or concealed intents for that matter: it being a point
directly tending to treason to her Majesty's person, and the Crown and State.
Sixthly, upon this sly device of equivocation, whereby the Jesuits hold it
dogmatizando, that they may not only to our adversaries, but even also to any
Catholic Magistrate, yea to the Pope himself, answer one way and mean
another, so as impossible it is for any that is not a Jesuit to know a Jesuits
heart: here-hence they have gotten or arrogated unto themselves an immunitie of
so ample privilege, as go where they list, neither Chancellor, Bishop nor
Archbishop may meddle with them, when they do amiss: stat pro ratione
voluntas: their own pleasure are their guides: and so strict a law imposed
upon all others, where ever they live, as do they but only pretend a matter,
they may not be called in question, nor once asked why they do it: so as their
arrogancy is grown to that height now, as the whole Clergy (unless some few
persons desirous to live quiet, and let all run on wheels) as well secular as
religious throughout Italy, France, and Spain, are brought almost to a non
plus, not knowing what course to take to reform the^. And as for the English
seculars, presently upon the coming in of Fa. Campian and Fa. Parsons, they
were but counted as their assistants, and that only in administering of
sacraments: for Fa. Heywood durst presume to forbid preaching, etc. Seventhly,
upon this intolerable pride, hypocrisy and immunitie arrogated unto the^;
whereby no Prince or prelate living can escape their tongs, pens, yea nor fists
(if it come to banding) until these mortificats have their wills, nothing being
well done, nor any government well managed without their direction, as wanting
discretion, zeal, learning or something, which these illuminates, made of a
more excellent mould must perfect and reform in the gross headed seculars:
there follows then presently after it, another device plotted of purpose to
make it seem meet to the ignorant multitude and afterward to others (for note
this, that popularitie is the rouer they aim at in all their proceedings, the
mobile vulgus being ever wavering and readiest to run upon every change) that
all the whole Clergy both Ecclesiastical and Monastical throughout all
nations should be subject to the^. And to put this device in execution, England
is made the maine chance of Christendom this day. For effectuating whereof,
having brought all things to that forwardness, as all the Colleges and
Seminaries at Rome, Doway, Civil, Valledolid, and elsewhere beyond the seas,
are under the Jesuitical government (or rather vsurpate tyranny,) the
contention being about Father Westons supremacy (forsooth) over the rest of
the reverend, ancient, and worthy Confessors the secular Priests in prison:
and Fa. Garnets sovereignty over the rest abroad, having already appointed a
silly man for an Archpriest, as substitute under him, and he as Provincial
here under Fa. Parsons, nostri fundi calamitas: there is now wanting nothing,
but to bring this platform to perfection. But for the device it self in
contriuing this Luciferian aspire, it is this. They bear the people in hand,
that the secular Priests, (besides their want of learning and zeal, which
occasionated their immunitie over the^) are (forsooth) more subject to error,
heresy and Apostacy, and more infirm, frail, weak, and readier to fall
then they are, etc.

What Princes will endure such person in their ^^ng^omes, as under pretense of
religion, shall infect their subjects w^^h such hateful co^^e^ts so dangerous
to their State: or who can be se^u^e of his stand if this popul^^ d^^trine take
to ^e in rebellious subjects hearts, and what ^^n be expected th^reby, but where
rebels can not have their w^^, presently to make h^mocke of the common wealth,
and inuest (...) with the Crowns.
8 From this freedom of the Jesuits, does issue out a fresh, a fair seeming
(but mischieuously poisoned) fountain of zealing crystal streams, divided
into two arms or riuals from the head: the one is called ordo ad Deum: the
other, obedientia. By means of which two, there is nothing can go or be done
amiss by any Jesuit: for that always it is either in ordine ad Deum, (if an
act of a superior:) or propter obedientiam, if done by a inferior. So as this
seditious, odious, blasphemous and sacrilegious abuse of Gods divine graces,
virtues, and benefits bestowed, is a dogbolt in every bow, and shaft in every
quiver, to draw out for the managing of any impious fact whatsoever. By this
the popular multitude may depose their Princes, and choose others at their
pleasure. By this no difference shall be put in their choice upon any right or
title to Crowns or Kingdoms by birth or blood, or otherwise: then as the
Fathers (forsooth) shall approve it. By this all things must be wrought and
framed, conformable to opportunity of times and occasions: as verbi gratia. The
people have a right and interest in them to do what they list in choice of a
King: marry yet limited by reason of the times and occasions now offered to one
of these two, scil. the King of Spain or the Lady Infanta. And then again the
times and occasions changing after a Spaniard is settled in the Crown: it must
be holden for a mistaking: yet such, as seeing it cannot be helped, the people
must beware hereafter of ever attempting the like again. It is manifest to any
that knows the Jesuits course that although they pretend all their designme^ts
to be ordine ad Deum, as directed to the common good of the Church: yet their
chiefest care is, how to advance and increase their own socie ie, hoping of
likelihood by their number to bring one day some great matter to pass, after
once they have firmly established their new Hierarchy, which being
perimpleshed, who so then lives shall hear other news then ever yet were heard
of, either of Antichrist (...) some other ^onster.
By this a check must be given to the publishers of such Paradoxes: after that
a dispensation procured for restoring the offender, and then shall all be well
ever after, etc.

9 Out of this directing and doing of all things in order ad Deum and for
obedience sake, they frame a new devise, how to make themselves not only above
seculars in authority, but also more mundane then any temporal worldling in
practice. And this devise is grounded upon a principle amongst them called, vti
scientia: that is, a rule prescribed unto them (if you please to know it) in
plain English how to learn to shift and live by their wits. And therefore
they, (as knowing better then any Cadger, Graser, Mercha^t, Farmer, Artizan,
Broker or Usurer, where and how a commodity is to be raised, and to be
disposed every way in ordine ad Deum) must command and rule all the rest in
every Noble and Gentleman's house where they reside. In so much as no lease must
be let, nor fine taken, nor piece of bread given, but by their advice. The
tenant must please them or grease them, or else repent it: a part of the fine
must be employed at their appointment: the Master or Mistress can scarcely
rule or do any thing without their approbation: the children and servants are
set in opposition against their parents and masters, if the least dislike be
had of these Rabbis. Yea I tremble to write what they have not feared to
work, and daily practice upon this sacrilegious and arrogant abuse of vti
scientia: whereby they knowing (as well by the servants, masters, and mistresses
confessions, as also by the wives against their husbands, husbands against
their wives, and the servants confessions against the^ both: all the secrets in
the house, how they have abused that sacred seal (which neither by word, nor
sign, nor by any other means, nor under what pretense soever may be opened to
death) and all of purpose to tyrannize over poor souls, as getting thereby
occasion to intrude themselves for disposing and managing of their worldly
causes, I leave it to sundry reports and woeful experiences, whereof Mistress
Wibur in Kent together with her husband can and will be witnesses another day
against Father Cur. the Jesuit, unless his repentance were great for it ere
he died.

10 To help this forward, there must be another shift or device: and that is,
at the coming into any Catholic country pretending by a charitable endeavor in
them to teach young youth gratis: their principal drift is, to single out the
finest wits, or (at least) fittest for their purpose, with whom they take
extraordinary pains to work them in by kindness, and cunning allurements (if
they be of good parentage) until they get them to promise, that they will be of
their society, or somewhat to that purpose (which is sufficient to seize upon
them, do their parents and friends what they can, unless they will incur a
slander of inclination to heresy, or to some other impiety: for so they
calumniate all that any way cross their designme^ts or proceedings: wherein if
they find any unready or impossible to be won or drawn unto them, they shall be
laden with detraction until their backs be broken. Of the woeful experience
whereof, the English College at Rome has left a mournful testimony to all
posterity (all Europe talking of the iars there, by reason of the Jesuits
tyrannical government) none but such as will be wholly Iesuited finding any
favor, rest or quiet in that place.

11 Having by these devises mentioned in the premises brought all to that
pass, Who so has read Actiones Tullij Cic. in C. Verrem, of the means that
proud Proconsul used in pilling, poulling and spoiling of cities: if they be
conferred by, and with the Jesuits, shall find that Verres was not more odious
amongst the Romans, then the Jesuits sleights, cousinages, frauds, thefts,
and apparently dishonest, and shameful courses, are odious to all that know
them.
according to Machiauels rule of divide and impera (which is as cunningly
practiced by the Rectors of the English Colleges every where, as in any place
of the world (I verily think this day) they taking all upon them, as great men
indeed, that were to be employed in matters of greater importance, then the
seculars were ordained or appointed unto: (for to that effect is Fa. Campians
letter out of England to their General) their driftes were deeper, the^ (to
say the truth) the seculars ever dreamed of (for mysteries are difficult to be
rightly understood, until the effects do interpret them) and therefore it was
necessary to maintain what they had begun, with a magnificencie agreeing to
the majesty they carried: that great sums of money (where was no man-rents,
nor other annual revenues) should be had to that intent and purpose. The drift
and device to bring this to pass, was, that though their fair gloses and
pretenses of zeal, having blinded and bewitched both clergy and laity, so
far as all gave way unto them, and suffered the^ even to do what they list:
they being thoroughly instructed by their principle (vti scientia) in the first
point of hawking, like Ma. Falconers of the game, knowing well how to ceaze on
a pray, and then to hold fast: got by their cunning carriage with the people by
little and little, so to carry all before them: as no alms was thought
sufficiently meritorious, unless it were sanctified by a Jesuits distribution.
Who pretending they were but religious collectours for prisoners, and other
distressed Catholics, have so fleeced their favorers, as over and above their
own expenses (which is known to be so exceeding great, as one of them, having
got 500. pounds at times, given to Priests and prisoners at Wishich, consumed
all at his own pleasure, and spends more then would maintain 20. imprisoned
secular Priests) they have been able of late to send over 2200. pounds toward
the Low countries, as was pretended, the prisoners in Wishich being then in
great want. I speak not here of Parry, first defrauding the prisoners of seven
and fifty pounds, seventeen shillings: and after spending 27. pounds of the
common money, by consent of his fellow Jesuits. Yea their accounts to the
prisoners have been so unjust, as the false steward mentioned in the Gospel,
may be thought to give place to them. In few, they have dealt so unconscionably
in these money matters, that whereas before Priests were honored for their
priestly function and labors agreeing to our Sauiors definitive sentence:
dignus est operarius mercede sua, and had many ghostly children depending upon
them, as upon their spiritual fathers, shepherds and guides of their souls:
they are now through the Jesuits falsehood, calumniations, and untrue
suggestions to their superiors, and to all estates brought into such high
contempt, as their ghostly children forsaking the^, none otherwise then if they
were stepfathers, show their charity so coldly toward them, as many are in
extreme want, and few or none but are scarce able to live. The mischief of
these men is great, their impiety so extreme and all their actions so
irreligious, that to recount from point to point, the stratageme, of all the
mortal strifes and wicked contentions begun, made, and managed by them, every
Quodlibet, nay every Article would make up a large Volume of more matter, then
time will permit me to contriue within the compass of this work now taken in
hand. But to be as brief as I may: by these eleven Principles or devises, you
may see that in all tyrannical, Turkish, and Machiuilean government, there is
none goes beyond them any where.

THE V. ARTICLE.
WHether any do equal the Jesuits in wit, learning, and profoundnesse of
knowledge, or no?

THE ANSWER.
THis Quodlibet may be answered as the former was: scil. that for crafty sly
cousinage, and such points, rules, and principles of learning, profoundnesse
and knowledge, as pertain to cony-catching and other Machiuilean devises,
there is none goes beyond them. Marry for that such base qualities are not to
be numbered amongst virtues or graces: either gratis datas, or gratos facientes:
nor yet they habituated therewith to be accounted of amongst honest men, much
less amongst generous hearts, and least of all amongst Priests. Therefore I
conclude that the Jesuits are sly, but nothing wise; they are crafty, but
nothing learned: they are cunning, but not profound: they are practical but of
no knowledge: and in all these gifts and excellencies of wit, learning,
profoundnesse, and true knowledge, there are, of both the seculars and
religious, that far surpass them every way.

THE VI. ARTICLE.
Whether then, if both secular and religious do surpass the Jesuits in
wisdom, learning, etc. do or have they or the Jesuits written or set out mo
and more learned books: and if they have, then how is it, that the Jesuits
bear the bell away, and that we neither see of their works (here in England
especially) neither of any either secular or religious to be of any fame, save
the Jesuits alone? It is a very mean occupation, and but course stuff that the
Jesuits can and will not make a commodity of one way or other. For who knowing
what number of learned there are in the world of Dominicanes, Franciscans,
Augustins Benedictines, Carthusians, etc. that I may omit sundry Cardinals
Bishops, Deanes, Canons, and others, secular Priests, yea of our own nation:
as Doctor Allane, Doctor Sanders, (though to much Iesuited) Doctor Harding,
Doctor Stapleton, Doctor Gifford, Doctor Parkinson, Doctor Ely, and a whole
score twice told, now in esse of secular Priests, who^ no English Jesuit is
able to hold tacke withal, yet have these Machiauels got such a general fame
and report to fly abroad of them, as though there were not one of any talent in
the world to be found unless he were a Jesuit.


THE ANSWER.
I Answer: first, that where there is one learned man of the Jesuits, there
are a hundred either of seculars apart, or of religious apart. Secondly, where
there is one learned book written by any Jesuit, there are a couple of
thousands written by others as learned (at least if not more) as they are.
Thirdly, the cause why seculars (especially the Seminary Priests in England)
do not write so many, nor almost any book at all, as the Jesuits do and have
done, is partly for want of money (without which no Press will go) the the
seculars and Jesuits living apart in extremes: the former pining in defects,
and therefore can set out nothing: the other surfeiting in excess, and
therefore may set out what they please: partly also, for that the seculars have
been ever against writing of any such books, as might exasperate the present
State, or occasionate a displeasure against all, for some such private persons
offenses, which the Jesuits quite contrary least regarded. Nay, what books
have they written almost, but such as are farced with rebellious conspiracies
and treasons, justly occasionating a general persecution upon us all thereby?
Only one Fa. Parsons has written sundry books (for I account not of Fa.
Southwell, as whereof to make any ostentation of learning) and all those of one
practice or other in exasperating either against her Majesty directly, as his
Philopator, or against the whole State in general, as his Doleman: or against
all the blood royal in common, as his Appendix: or against the whole
commonwealth, as his Machiauell of oeconomickes, or book of Spanish Councels
against England, or against this or that Peer of this land in particular, as
his Greenecoate or Scribe. And as for his book of Resolution which gets him
all the praise, he has or can deserve, yet alack, alack, it is easy to lay
fine threeds together, when they are gathered to a man's hand: and as easy to
translate a work almost verbatim out of peecemeale copies into his mother
language. Fourthly, the seculars until now of late had no means from beyond
the seas for printing of any book: and in England they durst not venture (for
offending the State) without leave: whereas the Jesuits have always had
means both here and there, for what is it that money cannot compass? Fifthly,
the Jesuits have learned herein one special trick of Machiauell, which also
was thoroughly practiced of Erasmus in his days: and that was to be at
compositio^ with certain Nobles and great personages in Princes Courts to
spread abroad his books, with this prouiso, that they should report of every
thing he wrote to be rare, learned and eloquent, and himself the most famous
man of Europe for his pen in those days: for pregnancie of wit, dexterity of
invention, facility of passage, pleasing accents, delightful, with a natural
facility in all things: and then would he again in recompense of this grace
and favor, to requite their honorable esteem had, and caused generally to be
had of him: set them forth on the other side by dedicating of his books
either unto them, or taking some special occasion to write of them or their
progenitors, sound forth the Panigeries of their praises, extolling them above
the skies, for their Nobleness, their heroical hearts, martial prowess,
valiant acts, worthy feats, warlike exploits, honorable calling of parentage,
by birth, blood, and high renown highly descended. And fame always following
the reports of Echoes, such Nobles and Gentles, for natures portraicture in
the lineaments of their body, fine conueyance of their actions, not coined by
art, but naturally passing from them, as a forgetful custom by instinct of
proper kind: comely gesture, with countenance haughty, stern and champion-like,
yet dropped with spots of beauty, bounty, and magnanimity, intercepted with
graces of mildness, courtesy and affability: at a word courtly, regardfull,
pleasing and acceptable in all things: being the right compliants of times,
comperters of sages, and the full complements of all admirable aspects, as the
mirrors of virtue and all lively graces. Both by these means should be famous
and respected, inquired of, talked of, peerlesse. And all this that I have said
concerning the policy of Erasmus, you may please to decipher out in the
Jesuits with supererogation of an ouerheaped up measure. For let the person be
never such a dolt, dunce, or dotrel, or his actions never so base, ignominious
and dishonest or ridiculous: or his words or writings never so simple, gross
and exorbitant, or impertinent to the purpose: yet being a Jesuit, oh! he is a
rare man; another Salust, Cicero, or Demosthenes for eloquence, as was Father
Southwell, but yet came short of them: an other Chrysostom in preaching, as
Father Ned Coffin (alas poor silly man, sent. loquitur, etc.) An other equal,
nay far above that worthy pillar of the Church Saint Augustine, the Doctor
Angelical S. Thomas Aquinas, the most subtle disputer Doctor Scotus, as is
that top of wit Fa. Parsons; not worthy to hold the candle before the meanest
of any of all these, or sundry other far their inferiors. But what should we
say? fame flies far: and if the Jesuits wanted this trick of coggerie to
make them seem famous, nay matchless, nay peerless in setting out of
books, and doing of other like exercises pertaining to learning, government
and knowledge, I would say they had no scholerisme worth a blew button amongst
them, nor were they fit to foot the instep in Machiauels schools. Sixthly,
another cause there is why the Jesuits works and books are here in England so
common, frequent and much talked of, and almost none other named, or at least
accounted of at all. And that is forsooth an authority they have gotten to
their Archpriest now, to stop all others from writing of any thing, be it good
or bad, without his approbation or allowance: which he will never yield unto,
but with disgraces to the Author, as experience has tried it true. And besides
before this authority came, the Jesuits as high Admirals or Emperors of sea
and land, dealt so cunningly (few or none ever imagining such an ostentatiue
slight and vaineglorious device) as was, to have their own doings only
praised, to lie close couched and packt up at every mart) therein as few or no
books came ever from beyond the seas, but of some Jesuits setting forth: or if
they did, yet did not the discharge of that piece in striking sail, give so
sound report thereof as of theirs: and so still it seemed there was no learning
nor scholars, nor yet any one wise man, no nor sound Catholic or good
Christian in the world, unless he were either a Ieseuit, in re or in spe, or a
broker for them.

THE VII. ARTICLE.
Whether any other profession or religious order have done like good for
instructing of youth, or converting of countries to Gods Church, or reformation
of life and manners of such as live in the Church, as the Jesuits have, or not?

THE ANSWER.
LIke as I told you before, the Jesuits intrude themselves into both secular,
religious and temporal Princes affairs: and must every one of them be Rector
chori and Dominus fac totum, and an absolute superlatiue in all things, or else
all is naught: So herein they challenge a prerogative royal to themselves
alone, so far beyond all measure of copartnership with any other, as they
have been bold to affirm, that religion had utterly quailed, if they had not
been: yea the Catholic Church in eminent danger, to have been quite extinct
and overthrown. In so much, as they have not feared to affirm, that the Pope
erred de facto in the reconciliation of the French King: which great, no less
impudency and insolency, then arrogance and impiety in them, as it may be put
amongst others of their malepart errors, and vsurpate censures: so know they to
their own perdition, shame and confusion, that the Church of God has no need
of them. But let them all (as I pray God for their wretched souls sakes, that
too many of them do not) prove rank heretics: yet for the Catholic says and
Church of God, neither they, neither portae inferi preualebunt aduersus eam:
and that he qui potens est ex lapidibus suscitare filios Abrahae, can raise up
better, more learned, prudent and perfecter and purer, then any pure illuminate
amongst them: out of the very ashes and dust of seculars, or other religious
bodies, when they are all dead and gone to the place prepared for them. And
therefore in answer to the Article I say. First, that as it has always bin
seen hitherto in Gods Church, at the rising of any new and extraordinary sect
or opinion in religion, that God has stirred up some certain person or order
of religion, to be a curb to that new sect or heresy, as is clear by S.
Benedict, by S. Dominicke, by S. Augustine, by S. Thomas Aquinas, and sundry
others, and yet not these such as without whom the Catholic faith had bin
extinct, or the Church of God overthrown.

So re^rend a regard was always had of both secular and religious persons as
no Noble or other Peer of highest honor in this la^d, but would have had their
children: yea, their heirs brought up in Bishops palaces, or Abbots
monasteries, under those spiritual guides, before ever any Jesuit came within
ken of humane knowledge. Yea some Bishops in England are recorded to have had
7. or 8. Earls with other Noble men's sons attending upon the^ at one time:
not that any Bishop did expect service at their hands, but that it was thought
fit to train them up these in their youth, etc.
So no question of it, but the Jesuits at the first institution of their society
did much good in these dangerous times of heresies, sects and innouations,
wherewith the Christian world was and is yet entangled, more is the pity: but
yet being far inferior to the above named religious orders: as the church of
God could the^ have bin without the^, so now much more without these; and yet
done as well, and perhaps better as now the case sta^ds, the^ she has done by
their helps and means. Secondly, for their instruction of youth, etc. I have
told you enough before: it is but a double diligence like to a Bears love to
his whelps to pray for his own paunch. And yet take it in best sense, there
have bin, are, and will be, youths brought up better then they do both by
secular and religious teachers, when they shall be far to seek. Mary that it is
so now for the present it proceeds of one of their former tricks of gaining
credit and fame, as by alluring sweet natured youths unto them: and withal in
stopping by disgracing speeches and other means, that none whom they can
hinder, shall be governed, taught, or instructed by any but themselves. Yea, was
not this one special cause of foisting in the Jesuits readers into the Roman
College and other places? was not this one special cause to hinder the
Benedictines religious intent and charitable designments: when they offered to
have brought up and maintained 30. English youths from time to time, to
prepare them for their native country. Which these Momists, Zoilists,
Aristerkists, and envious Jesuits could not endure to hear of? was not this
the cause of their Archpriests late command that no youth should go over to any
College without his approbation and testimony given of him to the fathers? Yea
and withal, has not this been the cause that many fine young Gentlemen have
lost their wits, and have been made incapable of all government either in the
Church or commonwealth ever after? Let one William Tempest as fine a youth,
and one who had as many signs of a generous heart and gentle blood in him, as
any that ever went out of England in this age, be a heavy spectacle (as it
cannot choose but be so to all his friends) for all others to look upon: when
they are moved to send their children to be brought up under Jesuits. Thirdly,
concerning their pains taken in conversion of countries, I pray you what
nation is there that is wholly converted by their only means? They entered
Polony, and straight there followed upon it a rebellion against their
Sovereign, and in conclusion the Danskers would not admit him to be their King,
unless he would cast off that seditious society, that had raised such mutinies
against the Clergy. They pierced India, thrust out the Dominicans,
Augustinians and other poor religious Friars, and in fine made the Spaniards
become odious to that strange people and nation. They ruled the roast over al in
France. And whereunto tended all their seeming religious endeavor but treason to
the king, rebellion in his subjects, and population, ruin, and destruction of
their native country and commonwealth? They came here into England, and no
sooner had they set foot on shore, but presently their hearts were inflamed
with flashes of conspiracies, how to top the highest place. They have residence
in Spain, and how mightily have they labored to wring the bucklers out of the
Dominicans hands, for possessing the chair to teach at Salamanca. And with the
like busy turbulent and seditious heads is Germany, Bohemia, Cicily, Italy and
Rome it self molested, pestered, and disquieted. Therefore as they have
neither converted any country directly, and by their own only labors, but
perverted many a devout soul by sinister dealings: so neither have they done
half that good in any place wheresoeuet they yet came, as sundry both secular
and religious Priests have: and least of all merited any thing at Englands
hands, unless it be the guerdon of traitors for their conspiracies, against
both Prince, State and Peer. And a happy thing it had been to this land, and
especially to all Catholics, if never any of them had been borne.

THE VIII. ARTICLE.
Whether any other order of religion be so mightily impugned of all
professions as their society is, or no?

THE ANSWER.
I Think none at all at this present. What mischief falsehood, heresy, or
other impiety, but has been bolstered o^^ with authority of Scripture, and
examples to confirm (...) with all: which being turned back upon the wicked,
sets them rightly forth in their proper colors.
Yet notwithstanding non quia res agatur apud Graecos, impetrabunt Demosthenem.
Let them not think that all goes wholly on their sides, because they are
repugned on all sides (as they vainly make their vaunt of) nor think their
cause to be any whit the better because Catholics as well (say they) as
heretics do speak and write against them. No no, let father Parsons recall
his vain vaunt and ostentation made in his Ward-word to Sir Francis Hastings
Watchword. Let him cease from comparing himself with his and our Lord and
master Christ: for his comparison is odious: if it had been but in that sense
he there sets it down in, with a mere mortal man of Christ his rare
indowments abstracted from his diety. Let him return upon his own turbulent,
seditious, and irreligious head and heart, all his allegations and examples out
of Saint Paul's Epistes, and other places falsely applied by him to the secular
Priests and Catholic laity, that are in opposition against the Jesuits. For
if he esteem every Catholic to be a Diotriphe, that is against him, utterly
dislike of his course, and condemn in his best thoughts, many of his
assertions, as heresies, or at least most gross and impudent errors: he must
esteem so not only of the secular Priests in England with the whole Clergy
here, The Jesuits reproachful speeches against all Catholics in general,
built upon these 2. erroneous principles, scil. one that it is a testimony of
their sanctity, holiness, rightful cause, etc. because they are persecucuted
of all men most: the other that it shows all those to be inclined to heresy,
that speak or write against the^, because all heretics do so. These 2. proud
Luciferian assertions in arrogating a pre-eminence of all excellency to
themselves, with contempt of all opposites unto them, declare a most dangerous
downfall of the^ all, into some horrible blasphemous heresy, it being
(morally) impossible: otherwise but that, what peculiar order, society,
corporation of company, soever should follow singularly in opposition and
controlment of all other orders, fellowship, yea and the whole state of Gods
Church, as the Jesuits do, (affirming all to be amiss, erroneous, and out of
order, but where they are and go^^^n^) must consequently become heretics, the
very proporsion of arrogating all unto themselves in this sort, necessitating
these sequels following, scil. ergo the truth is only with them, ergo the
Church only theirs, and where they are, ergo no truth nor Church without them,
ergo all the secular Priests are schismatikes and heretics, ergo no Catholic
amongst them: ergo no faith, no religion, no Church, no Pope: but a Jesuit, an
indubitate pillar of truth in all things.
but the Sorbonists in France with the whole Clergy there, yea, and
throughout Christendom: all for the most part disliking of them: the
Dominicans in Spain with all religious orders there: the Franciscans in Italy
with all Friars obseruants there: the Benedictines in Cicily and Naples, with
all the religious Monks there. In few, name me that nation, people, profession
or order (that I may omit here to recite the temporal state, or to name King,
Prince, or other Noble) in Christendom, that is not a Jesuit in affection or
faction, but mightily dislikes of them, but does impugn them, but wishes
either their amendment, or speedy downfall ere they bring all to ruin and
destruction with them. Therefore never let them boast of this, that it is a
testimony of their virtue: of their holiness: of their religious zeal: of
their painful endeavors, and of twenty odd cogging tricks they have to
bewitch the people with all, in making themselves famous, their quarrel good,
and their cause just against the secular Priests. For if the Zuinglians rising
up in arms in Germany (though they had many more thousands to take their part
against the Lutherans, then I hope the Jesuits shall ever have against the
secular Priests) could not thereby justify themselves, or persuade any but
their own faction, that they had right on their side: because not only all
the Catholics in Christendom spoke and wrote against them, but also all the
Protestants and others that were departed from the Catholic Roman Church
as well as they, if the Mahumetanes in Turkey howsoever they flatter themselves,
cannot make others believe that they have the right, because they are not only
impugned of all Christians throughout the world, but also, and most bitterly by
the Persian Mahumetane and diverse others: so deadly a contention being amongst
them about the body of Mahumet, and rightful heirs of Ella, as in the open
streets they have fallen together by the ears, and murdered one another in
the strife and contention about that matter: One saying this was the heir of
Ella, and another this. And yet who is ignorant of it, that they are more
Mahumetanes then Catholics: and then a fortiori, many more then there are
Jesuits. If finally it were no argument worthy the answering, that because
during the time of the Arrians, the Donatists, the Sabellianists, the
Manichees, the Nouatians, or other Arch-heretikes (there rising up some fine
fingerd figge-boyes in the Church that would teach a new trick, which neither
the Catholics whom they seemed and did to outward show in all things side with
all: neither yet those heretics gone before out of the Church, could either
allow or like of:) that therefore the same new masters should think all men
would be bewitched by them. Or if in case they could win more unto them, then
either the former Catholics or other sectaries could (as ordinarily it has
fallen out so cum sit natura hominum nouitatis auida) that therefore that was
an argument, of the truth to be in all things on their side. But rather quite
contrary that they coming in with new innouations, did directly prepare the
way to some new heresy, as the experience of all ages does make apparent. Then
let the Jesuits take up in time and vaunt (if vaunt they will) of some thing
else more to their credit, and driving of suspicion, jealousy and irremoueable
conceit to be had of some monstrous heresy to be in brewing amongst them: the
common saying being not more old then true, that that which one or two reports
may well be false: but that which all men say must needs be true. And if
either by our adversaries alone this speech, and slander (as the Jesuits
term it, but yet a slander of truth) had risen upon these seditious and
factious persons: or else that the secular Priests and some Catholics in
Enngland their fauorits had raised it: or France only bin the Heraults of that
blazon against them: or any one peculiar order of religion: as Dominicans,
Benedictines, etc. had only impugned them: it might have carried some sense to
have been but spoken of malice, private grudge or reuengefull mind at the
first, and so blown abroad by misinformation, detraction and slander,
augmented (like Scoggins wives crow, from one to twenty.) But now when Popes,
Cardinals, Bishops and secular Priests: when Kings, Princes, Lords, Ladies and
Nobles: when Gentles, Franklins, Farmors and artificers: when Generals,
Prouincials, Priors, Monks, Nuns, and Friars; when Catholics, Schismatikes,
Protestants, Puritanes, and all other professions, sects and opinions holden by
any, are controld by them, and do impugn, dislike, and cry out of them, and
every one of them upon a several ground, independent upon any relation made
from one to another to build upon: that then and in that case all should be
false that is reported of them: that therefore all their doings are
justifiable: their quarrel good, and their cause right, because impugned on
all sides: that this should be any testimony of error, heresy, Apostasy, or
Atheism for any Catholic to dislike of them, or write against them: because
an Apostata Bell did so, or because such and such heretics that are fallen out
of their society (and Gods Church withal) have done so: or for that the
Protestants and present state in England do generally hate them: that hereupon
they should infer by necessary sequel, scil. because such and such
schismatikes and heretics, etc. write against us, ergo all secular Priests or
other Catholics that do so, are schismatikes and heretics. This I say is so
gross a consequent, as if it were true they might by induction infer and
prove it, that the Pope, Cardinals, Bishops, Prelates, and all the whole
Clergy were schismatikes and heretics save only such as sided with the
Jesuits: and then upon that infer again that the Church were no where but
amongst the Jesuits to be found: Et sic, vno absurdo dato plura sequuntur. No
heresy ever yet was, but it began upon these very principles or the like
grounds: whereof, and for to give you more light in this matter read Vinc.
Lirinensis: and then tell me what you think these Jesuitical assertions are
like to come unto.

THE IX. ARTICLE.
WHether any order or profession have greater, better, or more signs of
assurances that God fights for them, then the Jesuits have, or no?

THE ANSWER.
THey are so far from all signs or tokens that God fights for them, that
on the contrary, they have all the marks and impressions of his heavy wrath,
and a hideous destruction to fall upon them, hanging eminent over their heads.
For who that is a sound Catholic, but knows that these propositions, are
manifest signs of reprobation to those that presumptuously build upon the^ as
the Jesuits do. scil. First, I am not like to other men. i. so gross a sinner.
Secondly, I am of a society that cannot do amiss. i. neither err in faith,
nor manners, nor government. Thirdly, I am in a state of perfection that
cannot be bettered on earth. i. perfect in all things. Fourthly, I am more
near and familiar with God then any other. i. illuminated with his divine
presence. Fifthly, I am most certain and fully assured that I do nothing but in
ordine ad Deum. i. predestinate and cannot be damned. Sixthly, I am most
certain that all that fight against me, fight against Christ. i. fully assured
that God fights for me. Seventhly, I am out of doubt that all those that dye in
and of our society, receive a plenary indulgence, or else a general pardon of
all their sins, ergo a Jesuit cannot be damned, etc. A thousand such like
positions the Jesuits have, which now I cannot stand upon, but leave them as
they are a most dangerous company, for any man or woman that has care of their
own soul to match or deal withal. And sure if the Scriptures had not said,
that the devil can transform himself into an Anof light, I should hardly have
thought it possible for any ever to have bin deceived, as (I said) many are by
the Jesuits plausible doctrine: carrying poison in their tongues unseen, and
infecting all unknown, that gaze and admire at them. Sed haec est potestas
tenebrarum.

THE X. ARTICLE.
Whether then (the premises considered in these nine precedent Articles) the
Iesuitical labor to enrich themselves, be according to their rules of good
life, to do all things gratis. And if it be, whether their devises to that end
be lawful, and especially their manner of giving the exercise both to men and
women, and what their intent and meaning is, or can be judged to be therein?

THE ANSWER.
HEre a true compassionate heart might take the Prophets words out of his mouth,
on our dear countrymen and women's behalf (the never enough to be bewailed
Catholics of this age) and say, quis dabit captii meo aquam aut oculis meis
fontem lachrymarum, to deplore day and night the Church Catholics present
calamities. My heart does bleed to think what here I must write of, for an
vpshot to these Quodlibets of same and report, by ruminating with my self, how
infamous the Jesuits will remain to all posterity that shall read or hear of
what (for discharge of mine own conscience, for the ease of many a languishing
heart, and for a caveat to all men and women, If great S. Gregory being a
stranger to our nation, did be wail the wretched state wherein he saw our
ancestors, and forefathers live in time of paganitine, in so much as he could
take no rest until first by voluntary intrusion and offer of himself to the
hazard, and after being prevented of his zealous intent, urging of S. Augustine
to give the attempt for conversion of this land, not by the sword or hostile
invasion, but by offernig of sacrifice, by preaching and teaching by going a
procession, in singing the Letanie, and by continual prayer, never giving it
over until he had won all those sweet souls unto Christ: of whom he was wo^t
to say O what a griese it is to see such angellike looks, to have so loathsome
foul spirits within them, and if Saint Ambrose in hearing of confessions,
would of en burst out into such vollees of sighs, and floods of tears, as
would have moved a heart of flint to repentance: then wonder not if any
Catholic Priest that has any heart at all, cannot but be moved with pity, and
pricked with pangs of inconsolable griefs, to see that state wherein Catholic
souls now stand by these mischeiuous men's sedition, incensing the^ against
secular Priests, and on the other side to remember the happy, joyful and
comfortable life, all Catholics did lead before the Jesuits came into this
land.
to beware of all hypocrites for a Jesuits sake hereafter) I must deliver
perforce.

That meditation has ever been in use as a mental prayer in the Catholic
Church since God was borne: it is manifest by the practice of the Princely
Prophet, who living above 1000. years before that time: said then and in
meditatione mea exardescit ignis. Many most sweet, comfortable, and devout
exercises, works of Christian renuntiation (and other instructions, yea and
those such as our Jesuits works could never yet counteruaile for that matter)
have been given and set out by sundry reverend fathers, and far more spiritual
men then these medly, mundane, religious Jesuits are: as both their life, the
fruits of their labors, and the books, and other memories of their works left
behind them witness it: and among others the Soliquium of S. Augustius,
together with his, S. Bernards and S. Anselmes meditations, etc. also
Lanspargine his Pharetra diuini amoris: together with the Epistle of Jesus
Christ to the devout soul, now in English translated out of him: and
furthermore Blosius, Gerson, Granado, with many more do convince it as
undoubtedly true. Again never was there more flexible, sweet, and mild natures
then are in England at this day of both sexes to work upon, nor more forward,
religious, and better inclinations to a virtuous life, a speedy resolve, a
voluntary willing, and comfortable yield: and an aptness or disposition in
nature, as a man might say, framed of so delicate, tender and fine a mould, to
obey readily to all such things as shall be put into their heads or hearts, for
their spiritual weal, and helping of their poor souls forwards to a
heavenly course of life under an earthly shroud, the^ this age does yield. Of
this none can be ignorant that have had the charge of souls: many with tears
of cordial griefs for their own offenses, renewed of a filial love, hearing
the confessions of penitent hearts have often remembered it. That there was
never any doubt or question made whether a Priest might receive any sum of
money less or more according to the devotion of the giver, and that either to
be left free to dispose of it as he list to others: or to retain all to
himself, especially in time of persecution, when no patrimony nor benefice,
nor other alms or means to live is to be looked for, it is clear by Saint
Paul's words, speaking in the person of all Priests: saying to the laity (whom
the insinuates to be bound in justice and charity so to do) scil. if we give
you spiritual things, it is but a small matter for you to bestow part of your
temporals and superfluities of fortune upon us again, as also oracled from
those divine lips that spoke it in sadness: that spoke it in charge: that
spoke it in rigor of justice, dignus est operarius mercede sua: as much to
say, as they sin grievously, that withhold from Priests their necessary
relief: the withholding of workmans pay or laborers wages, being one of the
sins that cry for vengeance to heaven, and most of all when it is denied to
Christ his Priests, which is to deny it to Christ himself in the highest
degree, because Christ's part is a Priests inheritance, Deus pars hereditatis
meae and calicis mei, etc.

That it is lawful, and a meritorious work for a man or woman, to give all he
or she has from them for the love of Christ (not that any is bound at all
times so to do of precept, but wished of counsel for avoiding the occasion of
unlawful delight taken in transitory things) it appears plain by our
Saviors own words in the Gospel to the rich young man, saying: If thou will
be perfect, vade and vende omnia quae habes and da pauperibus and veni and
sequere me, etc. Which Saint Hierome expounding, says it is not enough to
forsake the world and to leave all, etc. for so did Socrates, Plato, and sundry
other of the Heathen Philosophers, yea, many heretics have done the like. Sed
iungit (says he) quae perfectu^ est scil. and veni, etc. as much to say, as
that once done, then come and follow me: casting off not only the actual
possession of wordly riches, together with the contentment and pleasure taken
therein: but even also the vain glory taken in forsaking of them, and doing it
only for the love of me, following my example and intent of so doing it, that
you may vacare and videre quam suauis sit Dominus. Hoc enim proprium est
Apostolorum atque credentium, etc. And this do all the ancient revenues, lands
and liuelihoods given to the Church in times past attest and confirm. Not a
Bishoprike, Deanery, Abbacy, Monastery, nor other College or Cloister, endued
with possessions appropriated to their houses: but witness the great devotion
of our forefathers, of Kings, Princes, Nobles and Gentles of both sexes in this
holy I Will, worthily called Anglia chara Deo gens, and our Ladies dower for these
respects and others the like. No nation under the cope of heaven more liberal
to Gods Church, more regardfull of his servants and Priests, more ready with
alacrity of mind to set forth the Churches glory in honor of her sweet
spouse, nor more tender, scrupulous and chary of their conscience and souls
health, then English hearts have bin, and (to Gods glory be it spoken) many are
yet to this hour.

Two things have been generally noted in an English nature (that is not of a
base and bastardly brood, as father Parsons is: who together with other
Jesuitical weeds degenerate from a native country gentle incline:) one is;
an earnest desire of setting forth Gods glory with an extraordinary pomp and
majesty, which has been noted in other nations, that wheresoever the English
Cardinals or other Bishops came, When the prophet in the person of Christ
desp^sed the Jews gif^s and sacrifices, as moved with anger that they should
seem to offer him meager, lame, blind, and the basest of their cattle and other
things unto him, Doctor^ do expound it as a figure of his priests and offerings
and tithes in the new law, scil. that they should offer him the best of all
their fruits, and that his priests should be of the best wits, education,
comelines and disposition of nature, and not of the worst sort, as many put
their children, that are fit for nothing else to enter into the state
ecclesiastical.
they kept a Princely port in comparison of their equals in other countries,
few or none being able to maintain the like courtly train: another, in that
they were always loving, faithful and serviceable to God and their Prince, as
naturally inclined to loyalty, duty and thankfulness in all things. Both which
prerogatives of generous English hearts are now (ah hey me, alas for woe)
abolished, obliterated, and stained with seditious factions, and unnatural
dispositions, sprung out of oleastriall graffes amongst us. In few, that it is
lawful, commendable, yea and expedient for priests to strain themselves how
to win al hearts unto them: and therefore behooves it them to be wise, discreet,
virtuous, learned, religious, of special good government, knowing when to
check and when to cherish again, and above all not to be either in personage or
inclination of a hard, harsh, bitter, galling, sower, surly, and melancholy
nature or disposition; but comely, grave, modest, affable, compassionate,
humble, charitable, pitiful, and of a tender fortitude and comfortable
magnanimity toward al sorts of persons: it is to be proved (as apparently is
to be seen) out of sundry places of holy Scripture with the approbation of the
Churches, canons, constitutions and decres, for such as are to be admitted into
holy orders: as that they should not have any notable defect either in nature
or nurture, or other mischance in them: as not to be lame downright, nor
wanting one leg or hand, or both, or blind of both, or only the left eye, or
with more principal members then nature allows of, and sundry other notorious
deformities which cannot be helped: also if he be, or have bin a bloudsucker, a
hangma^, a butcher, a bastard, etc. Al these things with many the like do
irregulate the party that has them, and makes him incapable of priesthood;
yea some of them cannot be dispensed withal. Also if he have a foul leprosy,
continual shaking or dead palsy in his hands, ordinary falling sickness, or
publicly known to be a notorious drunkard, whorehunter, cousiner, usurer, etc.
None of all which or the like are to be admitted into holy orders, much less
to Gods altar in the highest degree.

These things being al evident, plain, and of none denied, notwithstanding al
these immunities, privileges, prerogatives, graces, blessings and benefits
bestowed on man in general, and committed to his priests in special to
distribute them amongst the rest of his servants, his flock committed to their
charge: that yet some should so pernitiously abuse, pervert and turn al to a
contrary sense in practice to that which they publicly preach, and seem at
the first also in private to insinuate, and neither allow nor auow it to be
otherwise: that so many sweet natures should be so bitterly abused as under
pretense of persuading them to give all they have from them to follow Christ,
that they should entice them, nay bind them to believe they may not in
conscience follow any but them, nor be directed by any other, nor receive the
exercise at any ones hands besides, nor enter into any other order of religion
but theirs alone: that those sums of money either bestowed of devotion in Pios
vsus in general, or admit they were (as they are not) bestowed upon this or
that particular private person only, All posterity so long as man is man, when
Jesuits and seminary priest^ shall both be banished and gone, will talk of
the Jesuits tyranny used in England under Queen Elizabeth, against Catholics
and secular Priests. The like bloody, cruel, monstro^s, and ^^^^cilesse
stratagem^, having ne^e^ been heard of in any age past, nor I think ever like
to happen hereafter, unless at the coming of Antichrist if unhappily these do
not bring him forth amongst them, or make the way plain for him to enter.)
Only herein may rest the comfort of an English heart, that being assalted on
all sides (as the secular Priests with other Cath. of the laity that follow
them are) in this dangerous innouatio^ if they hold out against them, and stand
stiff on the behalf of the Cath. Church and clergy in general, without
yielding to this private Jesuitical faction in special, upon any false
suggestion that the Christian faith and truth is on their side: the^ certainly
it cannot choose but that Antechrist shall have hard entrance among them. For
though we must needs think that he will pass all other for seducing of souls,
because our Savior said so: in so much as it shall be hard for the elect to be
saved, his baits will be laid so cunningly: yet to speak morally, it seems
impossible for Antichrist to invent a more sleighty, plausible and colorable
device nor with greater art or more cunning tricks bring it about to make him
be credited, then the Jesuits have invented and put in practice, etc.
and in special of pure love and mere good will and affection, without all
couine, deceit, or other sinister means of the doners used, for enticing of
the donees so to bestow it, should or may lawfully be turned as in pium vsum,
of the parties own purse to spend at his pleasure, or be employed only in
bonum priuatum huius vel alterius societatis, when bonum publicum and commune
does exact it before God at his hands, when clamant familici (says S. Bernard)
the children of our common holy mother the Church cry out for food, languish
in necessity, and perish for want of relief (the direct case of English
Catholics, yea of secular Priests) and the false stewards appointed (nay in
this English case tyrannically intruding themselves) to be their Collectors,
like cruel murderers keeping from them al natural sustenance, yea cutting off
al helps and means of providing for them: O heathen princes and pagan judges,
void of al knowledge of Christian laws, come sit in judgment upon these bloody
hearted Jesuits, that thus pervert all, both Gods and man's laws, and run
against the course of nature and of kind, give sentence against them, let their
names be in everlasting detestation. Priests and lay persons lie in prison,
they live in extreme want both in durance and abroad, whiles the common
benevolence sent from benefactors is seized upon into the Jesuits private
purses. It is allowable and justifiable in and by all laws that the needy may
take by secret stealth or open violence to sustain his present wants in
extremity and eminent danger of death by famine or otherwise, for hunger
breaks through strongest walls: the Priests and Pastors of Gods Church are
bound in such cases of extremity, to break and sell the chalices and other most
precious ornaments of the church, for relief of the churches children, be they
the meanest or poorest beggars that are, rather then to see them famish for
want of food. The cruellest tyrants that ever were, eue^ amongst Heathen and
Gentiles, seldom or never inflicted so cruel a death, as to suffer any over
whom they tyrannized to famish ^^r want of food. The laws of nature and
nations, have always so provided, that captives and prisoners though never so
vile and wretched persons or malefactors should have relief: and never was it
heard of to my remembrance, that any judge denounced by definitive sentence
from the tribunal seat: that the malefactor (for what crime soever condemned)
should be famished to death, unless it were so that the condemned person had
been the death by cruelty used to some other in that manner of murder, for that
then and therein it is Lex talionis, vt in quo quis peccauit in eodem punietur.
Now then that this never practiced nor ordinarily heard of the like cruelty,
amongst heathen and infidels, should be in use amongst the Christians, nay
amongst Catholics, nay amongst Priests, nay amongst religious persons, and
that against their own dear brethren, countrymen and friends, that suffer for
the same cause which they pretend to suffer for, that this should be maintained
as lawful by any Jesuit, who takes upon him to be an illuminate, an inculpable
guider of souls, and a man come to the highest step of the scale or ladder of
perfection: that all laws should bind men to give of their own proper goods and
treasures, for relief of captives and the poor and needy, and that these men
notwithstanding should withhold not their own (which were more tolerable) but
other devout and charitable persons both men and women's devotions and
benevolence: and that not from ordinary captives, or other poor afflicted for
Christ his sake: but for such as are (not without cause of jealousy had of
the^ all) for the Jesuits cursed conspiracies and treacherous attempts,
persecuted, imprisoned and put to death, The very Canibals and Anthropophagies
shall rise up at the last day, and condemn this barbarous and savage
generation of Belials brood for this crime. And whereas the grace of God
derived to his Church by the sacred priesthood ought to be bestowed gratis, as
is said: Gratis accepistis gratis date: the Jesuits have devised a false kind
of exercise, whereby to fleece charitable people, and so enrich themselves,
therein imitating Simon Magus, in selling Gods blessings: nay in that, their
precise course is far more execrable then his was.

For Simon Magus dealt plainly (though villanously and most blasphemously) in
offering to buy the holy Ghost and gifts of God for money. But these (o what
shall I term them) deal cousiningly, in making people believe, that the
exercises or other graces which they bestow in Gods behalf are more precious
and singular in themselves, then if given by any other either secular or
religious Priest that is not Iesuited, The persecution of the Jesuits is so
extreme, in depriving of prisoners, yea and all others abroad so much as they
can possibly, of all relief: that unless her Majesty and honorable Council
either clearly dismiss her tried (most loyal subjects) with a gracious
conniuence at their secret use of their function, no way seeking to offend any
one, or else extend her magnificall beneficence in maintaining them as
condemned to her Highness prisons, they are not possibly long to continue, hold
out, or live.
and so draw them on by little and little to make it seem a matter in
conscience to give any thing from them, nay not to give all a man or woman
has or can possibly make for them, in recompense of these so great and
extraordinary gifts and graces bestowed upon them. As though the least gift of
God or drop of grace given in and by any sacrament ministered by any though the
meanest priest, be able to be counteruailed with all the wealth in the world:
which foul abuse is nothing else but a mere mental Simonie, usury,
sacrilege and most impious hypocrisy. That this shameful theft should not
only pass unpunished, in measure according to the quality, condition and
state of the person, who taking upon him a religious profession, it aggrauates
(at least if it do not alter and change) the sin to be more heinous in him,
then in any other, by many degrees of impiety. But withal, that the people
should be set on to auow it, as most just and convenient to be so, scil. that
no relief should be sent to any opposite to a cursed pharisaicall Jesuits
designements, yea and that the Jesuits themselves should glory in it and make
their vaunt of it, scil. that they will make all the secular priests leap at a
crust ere it be long (for so said that good holy father John Gerrard of late to
the Lady Markham in Notingham shire, who told it shortly after to Master
Atkinson, etc. and that they will drive the Seculars perforce to yield unto
them for mere poverty and want: The pillages of the Jesuits both in England
and Scotland, being so much the more odious, by how much as spiritual
robberies, yea and that committed by religious seeming persons, pass al
temporal pilferings, there are three in chief, which are generally to be
noted. First, a report of faculties gotten to abstract from what parsonage or
vicarige they list, all spiritualities (for preventing forsooth of symony)
thereby to make them merely temporal and saleable: and then being sold at the
highest rates upon pretense of dividing the money betwixt S. Peter and poor
prisoners: one good father or other comes with Dominus opus habet, and makes
always the best part of it their own clear gains. Secondly, alike to this
is their order set down for restitution: as verbi gratia an usurer or
extraordinary gaine-maker by buying or selling, or by anticipation or dilation
of payment: or a Lawyer taking more of Clients then his ordinary fees: or a
procurer of any evil cause: also a landlord, Sheriff, or other officer or
person, whosoever that gets any thing falsely or indirectly, for which a
restitutio^ (as indeed there ought) must be made: because the parties often
know not how much nor to whom to make it, therefore must they compound
(forsooth) with the fathers giving certa pro incertis to Saint Peter and the
prisoners: but the fathers swallow up all or the most of it yearly amounting to
a mighty sum of money: some one man having given 500. pounds to that end.
Thirdly, but amongst al their devises to enrich and increase their order, their
form of meditation called by the^ an holy exercise is worthy the noting, for
all others to beware of them, that have not felt the smart of it already: and
this practice is for such as are either for their pregnancie of wit and
learning, or their parentage and friends, or their wealth and possessions fit
for the Jesuits purpose: and cannot otherwise but by the taking of this holy
exercise be allured to their society.
) this then is such a barbarous cruelty as I want words to express the
abhominatio^ of the sin. Master Tempest was so canuased amongst them, that
having his faculties taken from him, and being thrust out a doors, of his own
friends, his father in law hiding his face when he came in place where he was,
his own sister not daring to own nor acknowledge him, nor to send him any
relief: and in few, his ghostly father denying him to come at the Sacraments:
at length being thus cruelly dealt withal, he was forced to yield to
whatsoever they would urge him unto: notwithstanding, that as himself has
since confessed, and told some of his friends: he never to death could or
should like of them in his heart, knowing their tyranny and extreme cruelty to
pass all measure, against whomsoever they powered out their wrath. The like was
their most odious and inhumane cruelty showed toward master Benson in keeping
him from all relief: so as he became far in debt and being in the Counter, his
fellow prisoner master Edward Coffin a young Jesuit having abundance, known
to be sent and brought unto him, yet could of his Jesuitical charity, suffer
him to continue in that want wherein he lived.

It were too tedious to recount all the inhumane parts of these cruel hearted
men, of their dogged natures, and Jewish hearts, where once they conceive a
dislike, rightly fulfilling therein that Atheall principle of Machiauell: never
to pardon (though in policy it be good to flatter and fawn, until thou see
thy time and may take thine advantage without repulse) where thou once have
taken a displeasure against any person public or private, or common society,
or other corporation or company. I could enlarge my self here with a long
tragical discourse of this one party last named, how maliciously they have
been bent against him: not for any thing that he has either published or done
against them: but only for that, upon earnest suite made unto him by me, I got
him to set me down with much a do, what he had heard and seen at Rome,
concerning the death of Pope Xistus, Cardinal Allane, Cardinal Tollet, the
Bishop of Cassana, and some others: of all which there went a general report,
that their lives were not any whit lengthned, howsoever they were or might be
shortened by the Jesuits means: as a great suspicion there was of all or most
of them. Which that reverend good Priest, of a mild modest and scrupulous
fear, writing sparingly unto me: attesting (as his Priestly behavior has
ever since approved it) that he was loath to meddle in discovery of any such
matter, being then in place where he was, rather to occupy the best thoughts of
his passage here hence (not knowing when he might be called to his account)
then to busy his wits with calling to mind, what had past in the Roman
College or elsewhere, during his abode there. And only that which he wrote
was, rather to excuse their impious dealings the^ otherwise, being not so much
nor so plainly delivered as I had heard before. Yet this letter being so
cunningly intercepted, or stolen out of my cassocke pocket, or otherwise
revealed by one master C. Io. who played on both sides, as the effects showed
shortly after: or howsoever it was, a copy they got thereof: and to hear how
the Archpriest laid on load on the poor man for it, and how his good masters
the Jesuits prosecuted it, would make any man hate them ever after.

But to let these things pass, and to come to their sacriligeous abuse of that
manner of meditation and method of holy exercise which was with more devotion,
and more fruitful progress, practiced, ere ever any Jesuit was borne, then
it has been since amongst them: although I do not deny, but it is very good,
and well set forth by them, as my self can partly witness of mine own
experience, having taken it at their hands: Mary the managing of a matter is
all, and therein the intention is chiefly to be respected: which is ordinarily
known through the effects produced by it. For although that act, which is of
it self evil, as we say intrinsice and per se, can never possibly be made
good: yet does it not therefore follow e conuerso, that an act which of it
self is good, can no way per accidens be made evil; verbi gratia, for a man to
kill his own father, or violently ravish his mother, can by no dispensatio^, or
other means ever be made lawful, good or allowable: but yet a man intending
to convert a soul, and takes his confession, with intent to enjoin him for
penance to murder his Sovereign, or commit some suchlike or far less
horrible crime, that act of teaching, preaching, and moving the penitent to
confession, is good of it self, but yet the intention makes it stark naught,
and damnable in him that urges, or persuades the said penitent unto it. To
this does fitly symbolize S. Augustines quadruparte destinction saying: Est
bonum been factum: and est bonum malefactum: Est malum malefactum: and est
malum benefactum: denotating by these two aduerbes been and male, the
intention: which may alter that per accidens that otherwise is, or might be
quite contrary per se. And so the Jesuits exercise: although in it self it did
far surpass and go beyond all others in matter, manner, and method observed in
the actual use of it: yet when it is done for an evil end, as to make it a
conicatching or cosening trick, or slight to pick a man or woman's purse, nay
to get all their lands by it, the^ is the intention wicked and naught, and by
consequent the act is naught in them. Of this exercise then (because it is a
point of most importance, as wherewith many good Catholics are mightily abused
both men and women: and especially such as be of the mildest, sweetest and
gentlest natures, fitter indeed for heaven then to live amongst such
counterfeits on earth) I will set you down, a relation made by a reverend
Priest, a most ancient and worthy co^fessor: and one whose hoary locks,
gravity, learning, wisdom, government and long sufferance, may justly apall and
abate the heat of the prowdest Jesuits haughty heart within this land. His
words are these, or to this effect set down as follows.

When the Jesuits find one fit for their turn: they insinuate themselves into
him, keep him company, use him with all kind of sweet behavior and courtesy:
and pretend to have an especial care of his well doing in all things, but
principally how he may attain to be in high favor with God. To which purpose
they enter by degrees into certain discourses of hell: wherein they omit none
of their skill, by authorities, examples, and large amplifications to make the
same as terrible, as possibly they can. By which course they cast the party in
time, into great fear and pensiveness (all which were well done, if it were
to a good end.) When they have held on after this sort so long, as they think
convenient intermingling now and the^ some co^forts, least otherwise the party
under their fingers, should grow weary of them: then they begin to be more
plentiful, in the setting forth of such comfortable promises as are made in
the Scriptures to the children and servants of God. Here they omit no part of
their skill to describe the heavens: the Majesty and glory of God: the happy
estate and joys of the Saints in that everlasting kingdom: which is prepared
for those, who in this life shall embrace the Christian faith, and become
obedient children in their true calling unto their holy mother the Catholic
Roman Church.

In a letter of father John Gerrard the Jesuit dated in August 1599. to father
Parsons amongst other simple complements (whereby Protheus comports Camelion)
he uses these words: scil. Your self once showed me a most fine written book
touching the manner of giving the exercise, etc. And again, if there were any
special meditations used with you that are not o^dinary, such riches I would
beg, etc. Out of which words I have gathered 2. things, one that the silly man
had not the wit to invent any thing himself, as in the letter may appear,
wherein writing unto father Parsons for some written sermons, he desires him
that they might not be of any deep school point (as indeed above his
capacity:) another: that (as it appears by these words not ordinary) the
Jesuits invent still some new method for giving the exercise, agreeing to the
platform of cosinage cast by them: that when one mean or way of alluring unto
them fails, another may be put in practice.
Hereunto they add a discourse concerning the diversity of such callings, as
God has ordained for his servants and children to walk in: showing how
necessary it is for every man to understand and know, what calling that is,
which particularly belongs to himself: and what danger ensues when men do
rashly undertake any occasion either for profit or pleasure to follow this or
that course of life. As when Gentlemen being borne to great possessions, do
think it sufficient for them to follow the steps of their ancestors: esteeming
that to be the calling, which God has prepared for the^. Whereof it comes to
pass diverse times, that they make shipwreck of all their estates, and fall
into many calamities: God approving and sanctifying of no calling, which is not
entered into by direction of his holy spirit. Many (say they) through their own
rashness, are spiritual persons, who ought by Gods ordinance to have been of
the laity: and many on the other side are (as we term them) lay men, which
ought to be Ecclesiastical: both of them perishing in their own course,
through their own faults: in that they had no care to learn and know their
own proper calling ordained for the^: which God would have sanctified to their
eternal comforts: if they would have used the means to have understood and
embraced them.

In the description of these means the height, the depth and the breadth of
all their cosening does consist, as being the exercise it self above
mentioned. Of these means they do at the first speak only in a generality:
entering into a discourse of the loving kindness of God, that he has prepared
a way, whereby every man that list may know, how to serve him: whereinto so
many as will enter, may have assurance in themselves by the testimony of the
holy Ghost, what their several vocations are, whereunto God has called them,
and which they must undertake, if ever they mean to come into the joys and
consolations of the Paradise of God.

Thus after they have laid these grounds, no marvel if the party so cunningly
and kindly carried on, do fall into their traps Howbeit you must observe, that
in all these discourses made to such parties, they carry themselves so aloof,
as that there may be no suspicion of their intents to draw them by such their
practices to their society. So as when the poor souls (as ravished with a
desire to attain unto the said means or exercise so highly commended: and so
necessary for all that truly thirst after the kingdom of God and joys of
heaven) do entreat the holy fathers, that they may be received into that happy
and blessed exercise: their motion at the first in that behalf, the good
fathers seem little to regard: saying that peradventure this their desire
proceeds of passion: and therefore their manner is to leave them in this sort
for the first time: adding with what deliberation and judgment that sacred
exercise is to be undertaken: as being the ladder of Jacob, whereby they may
ascend into the third heaven, and there see and behold the admirable mysteries
of God.

If the party thus caught be of great possessions, wealth or parentage, they
are much the sooner entreated to admit him to this exercise. The manner whereof
is thus. The party at the time appointed coming to the holy father, who must
deal with him, is recluded from the speech of any body but the said father for
a certain time. Upon his first reclusion the father comes unto him, and
gives him a meditation to study upon, for some four or five hours: willing
him in the mean while carefully to remember all the cogitations that do come
into his mind. The said four or five hours expired, in comes this good
father, and then the party must be confessed: and is to reveal all his
particular thoughts, of what matter soever good or bad, that came into his mind
all the time of his aforesaid meditation: which done, the father gives the
party another meditation with the like instructions to the former: and after
the like distance of time returning, he hears his confessions again: and
thus the party is exercised diverse times every day the space of nine days, or
thereabouts, which is a passing good order, able to mortify a heart of flint:
But harken what follows.

In this space the holy father having framed the said meditations according to
his own drift: for example, if the party be rich, then of the contempt of the
world, and the vanity of worldly riches. And further perceiving by his
confessions, his disposition, and what effect the said meditations have
wrought, It would seem strange to some to hear that the Jesuits should
ordinarily reveal confessions per tertiam vel quartam personam or sub incerto
nomine yet so have they done most basely as will be proved against them verbi
gratia thus: he will find an occasion (after one has been with him at
confession) whose sins he is willing to have made known, to ask of his
fellows what say you to such a case. A man or woman falls into such or such
a sin, and after comes to the Sacrame^ s without confession made thereof:
what case is he in etc. And then they foreknowing of a general compact made
amongst the^, how to reveal secrets one to another, by putting out of cases
and doubts, that may rise at every time they were confessed, they know by this
mean, that seeing such a party w^^ last confessed, ergo^ is of him or he^
that it is ^^^nt, etc.
and are likely in the end to work in him (which always must be the forsaking
of the world as they term it) and for the most part, if they find him by this
trial, a sit man for the entrance into some profession of religion: then he
tells him a long tale of the fruit of his said exercise: as that he well
perceives by his sundry confessions, how the spirit of God has wrought in
him by the means of his said meditations: and that he now supposes him to be
fit to enter into the consideration and choice of that calling, whereunto God
himself has ordained him to lead his life and walk in, toward the
attainment of everlasting happiness. Whereupon the party has time to consider
with himself, whether he will be a Dominicane, Benedictine, Jesuit or what he
list. And yet thus far, well. But that time expired, the holy father enters
into a new stratageme.

The said party exercised (as is before expressed) coming thus unto his
election, has peradventure determined to be a Dominicane: or to take some such
other course, as he himself has thought of. So as when the said holy father
comes unto him, if he find him bent to any other profession then to be a
Jesuit, he begins to cast many doubts, and collecteth at his pleasure by
something that he has confessed unto him, that his said choice is not agreeing
to such godly motions, as the spirit of God wrought in him in the time of his
exercise: and therefore advises him to consider with himself better of his
choice, that the same may be suitable to the said motions of the holy Ghost.

The conclusion is, that the holy fathers by this means having sundry poor
souls in their hands, to work them by turns, devises and persuasions as they
list, never leave or suffer them to be quiet, until (if it be possible) they
make choice to be of the society of Jesus: if in all these practices with them,
they find them fit men for their turn. Howbeit sometimes it comes to pass
that the said devout fathers do meet with such persons, as will rather choose
to be of some other order, do what they can, then to be Jesuits, for that
spiritus vbi vult spirat. In which cases, when their practices to win the
parties for their learning, strength of wit, paretage, and other good parts
more then ordinary do fail: they desist from dealing with them by little and
little, and so in the end give them quite over: (meaning nothing less, then by
such their pains to increase the number of any other order of religious
persons:) and leave them to take what course they list. But yet with this fruit
of their exercises, that they will never love or endure them afterward, but
rail on them, and plague them so much as is possible.

Those they undertake for their wealth and large possessions, although such
things be an hinderance from entering into any religious profession at all: yet
do the Jesuits so far prevail, as for the most part they either allure them
to be Ecclesiastical Jesuits, if they have any tolerable gifts besides their
riches: and then all that they have must be sold, and the money committed to the
fathers discretio^s: or at least they draw the^ to be lay brothers, finding
none other good stuff in them. In which case they get from them, either all or
most part of their riches, and turn them either to be some of their officers,
or leave them at large to be practisers for them in such matters as they think
fit to employ them in abroad: as to be soliciters for them, and to stir up
the peoples charity to that society: not ceassing to persuade so many as they
can to follow their example.

This was the effect of one M. Gilbert, and M. Druries exercises, vz. that they
got from them all that ever they had: and then employing them in manner
aforesaid, procured the Popes blessing for them (for the better approving unto
them their new calling) as appears in the faculties granted to Fa. Parsons,
Campian, Heywood, etc. about 20. years since. The event of which proceedings
with the said Gentlemen was so apparent, that diverse greatly disliked of such
exercises, in so much as some in jest would say: such a one is Gilberted, and
such a one is Druried. And others again would say to the like effect: they
shall never Gilbert me, nor Drurie me, nor cousin me with such their holy
sleights.

Another young Gentleman not long since entering into this exercise under a
young Jesuit here in England, was found by his meditations to have lands yet
unsold, amounting in value to a 100. marks a year: wh^^h because it hindered
his journey to heaven, he offering the same to the said yo^g Jesuit: the good
young father allowing well the offer: said, that if he should receive the land,
her Majesty would take it from him: but (quoth he) sell it, and then I am
capable of the money. By which ghostly counsel the gentleman set his land to
sale, and was offered 900. pounds for it: but the holy father insisting upon a
thousand, the Gentleman died ere ever a Chapman could be gotten: and so the
good father lost all.

I could here recite many cousening parts played by sundry of the^, through the
abuse of giving this holy exercise: but I will only enlarge my self with a few
golden threedes of Fa. John Gerrards web, work and weauing who^ as I have
often pitied in my heart, by reason of a good disposition in nature, which I
ever taking him to be of have sundry times heartily wished, that he would
forsake them, and live like a secular Priest: so finding V^^gils Eclogue truly
verified in him, scil. Torua leaena lupum, sequitur lup^s ipse capellam:
Florentem cythisum sequitur lasciua capella, etc. Therefore to the end none
that reads these Quodlibets, unless they be wilfully blinded, shall ever
fear cousinage of him or his company hereafter; and for that it shall well
appear he is not the man (as but a simple man God wot) whom fame reports him
to be, I will here set down part of the cousining gains he has made of this
exercise.

First, he was the man that caused Henry Drurie to enter into this exercise;
and thereby got him to sell the Manor of Lozell in Suffolk, and other lands
to the value of 3500. pounds, and got all the money himself: the said Drurie
having chosen to be a lay brother. Afterward he sent him to Antwerpe to have
his Nouitiat by the Prouincial there, by name Oliuerius Ma^erius (for at that
time Fa. Garnet had not his full authority to admit any) where after twelve or
fourteen days he dyed, not without suspicion of some indirect dealing. Fa.
Holt the Jesuit ascribed it unto the alteration of his diet, saying: that he
might have lived well enough, if he had remained at home, and not have come
thither.

Two other had the exercise given them at that time by Fa. Gerrard: vz. Master
Anthony Rowse, of whom he got above 1000. pounds, and Master Thomas Euerard,
of whom he had many good books and other things.

Also he gave the exercise to Edward Walpoole, whom he caused to sell the
Manor of Tuddenham, and had of him about 1000. marks.

He dealt so in like manner with Master James Linacre his fellow prisoner in
the Clinke, from whom he drew there 400. pounds. And afterward got a promise
of him of all his lands: but was prevented thereof by the said Linacres death.

Furthermore under pretense of the said exercise he cousined Sir Edmond
Huddlestones son and heir by sundry sleights of above 1000. pounds. And so
he dealt with Master Thomas Wiseman: and by giving him the exercise, he got
his land, and sent him to Antwerpe where he died.

He also gave the exercise to the eldest son of Master Walter Hastings. And
he has drawn Master William Wiseman into the said exercise so often, as he
has left him now very bare to live.

He has so wrought with Master Nicholas King lately of Grayes Inn, as he
has gotten most of his living and sent him to Rome.

Master Roger Lee of Buckingham shire has been in this exercise likewise: and
is also by him sent to Rome.

In like manner he deals with such Gentlewomen, as he thinks fit for his
turn, and draws them to his exercise: as the Lady Louell, Mistress
Haywood, and Mistress Wiseman now prisoner: of whom he got so much as now she
feels the want of it.

By drawing Mistress Fortescue the widow of Master Edmond Fortescue into his
exercise, Master Garnet had the dealing with the Tremain^ and not master
Gerrard.
he got of her a farm worth 50. pounds a year and paid her no rent.

Another drift he has by his exercise of cousinage: which is to persuade such
Gentlewomen, as have large portions to their marriage to give the same to him
and his company, and to become Nuns.

So he prevailed with two of M. William Wisemans daughters of Broddocke: with
Elizabeth Sherly borne in Leicestershire: with Dorothy Ruckwood, M. Richard
Ruckwoods daughter of Suffolk, who had a great portion given unto her by the
Lady Elizabeth Drurie her Grandmother: with Mistress Mary Tremaine, Master
Tremaines daughter of Cornwall, she having a large portion: with Mistress Mary
Tremaine of Dorcetshire, of who^ he had above 200. pounds: with Mistress Anne
Arundell, of whom he got a great portion: with the Lady Mary Percie, who is now
a Nun at Bruxels.

Thus you see by these devises how mightily the Jesuits have increased their
riches, and enriched their coffers: expecting a time no doubt, when to draw
forth their treasure to their most advantage: and will offer largely, when
they think to get some principal man on their side, or otherwise to work his
overthrow: as was manifest by their sundry practices, against the Lord Dacre,
to whom a Priest (set on, as was supposed by Father Holt the Jesuit) after all
their many gross abuses offered unto his Lordship; which, with honor, he can
never put up at their hands made offer of a large annual sum of money, so as
he would be ruled; you must imagine by a Jesuit in profession or faction. But
this is enough for this time of their practices by Fame and Report.

THE ARGUMENT OF THE fourth General Quodlibet.
FOrasmuch as it does seem by the last Quodlibet of Fame and Report, that the
Jesuits direct all their intents, endeavors and studies to the advancement of
their society, they care not which way, by hook or by crook: and by
consequent, that they make religion in general, and therein their holy
exercise in special, but a mere Machiuilean device, of policy only to make
strong themselves in their busy preparations for a spiritual Monarchy:
therefore shall the next Quodlibet be of plots by Atheism, to examine
thoroughly how far wit, conscience, honesty and religion may run together
and not be discredited by one the other in their worldly political affairs.

THE FOVRTH QVODLIBET of Plots by Atheism.
THE I. ARTICLE.
WHether politia be a virtue or a vice: and whether lawful or unlawful to be
used?

THE ANSWER.
POlitia is like to a nose of wax, which may be turned what way soever a man
lists, and is pliable at all times, as fit to receive all impressions: fresh
and fair, or foul and filthy. But to speak properly of it, agreeing to the
Etymology of the word, it is always a virtue, and a special head, prime, or
master branch of prudence. And yet again take it agreeing to the common
acceptance in speech, use, and practice of it now adays, and it is a vice. And
so by consequent, policy is lawful or unlawful, good or bad, a virtue or a
vice according to the intention of the subject, wherein it is inhere^t: and the
matter, occasion, and other circumstances which do concur, or may occur,
and are or may be in hand.

THE II. ARTICLE.
Whether Master Nicholas Machiauell, or Father Robert Parsons excelled one
the other in policy: or whether any be in England this day to be preferred
before either of them, or any other Jesuit whosoever?

THE ANSWER.
IF any will believe Father Parsons or other Jesuit, there neither is, neither
was there ever any borne in this land that could equal that prudent
Polipragmon: or else can be able in any respect to be compared with him: nay,
nor with the veriest dunce that peepes out of his Nouitiate in a Jesuits
school. In so much as in their deep Jesuitical court of Parliament begun at
Styx in Phlegeton, and suggested thence into Fa. Parsons sconce, was ended and
compiled into a full complete volume by him and his General: and entitled,
The high court of reformation for England. There was therein sundry acts
enacted to this intent and purpose, whereof we speak, which were to take place
and be in force, when the Catholic conqueror of Spain, or Austria should be
invested with the scepter royal of our noble Elizaes, and sit enthronized in
her princely seat, as sole Monarch of all the Albions or great Britains Isl
s. And to give you a taste of their intent by that base court of a tribe of
traitors sawcily (like to Cade, Jack Straw, and Tom Tiler) usurping the
authority of both states Ecclesiastical and temporal in their rebellious
enterprises: these were principal points, discussed, set down and so decreed
upon by them.

Note here these Anabaptisticall heretics, how boldly they dare censure of
all others, and avouch themselves predestinates.
First, that no religious order should resort into this land, or be permitted to
live within the Britains Ocean, save only Jesuits and Capouchines. And their
reason was (as always a reason must be given for a prouiso, when it seems
extraordinary, contrary to a statute law, or former act enacted:) because the
holy Ghost has forsaken all the rest of religious orders, and is only in the
Capouchines and Jesuits. But if you would know further how this good fortune
falls so out to the Capouchines to be exempted from this general
irregularitie, and to be consorted with these predestinates: the reason is; for
that (as a good Capouchine once answered to the like question) they suit best
with the Jesuits humor by an Antipathie, not of nature, but of nurture: which
consists in this: that the Jesuits drift is to rule, and will have all: and
their profession is, to have nothing, nor to rule at all in anything. And now,
although these Jesuits profess voluntary poverty, and to renounce the world,
with all that belongs thereto, as all other religious orders do: yet because
they are homines secundum cor meum, so thoroughly mortified in the world,
Although it might have been in some sense a special point of uncharitable
policy for the Jesuits to have rejected that friendly offer to have brought up
30. of our English youths as at Rome: because that probably many of those
would have bin Benedictines, and have frustrat the Jesuits hope of having al
here for themselves without copartners: yet was it no policy in the^, to
beat a Priest almost to death, for but making the motion of receiving one into
the Benedictines order: for that foul fact did openly bewray their unmortified
passionate humors, pride, ambition, malice, avarice and other shameful vices,
too too bad to be spoken of, but most of all to be in any religious person.
that with the worlds weapons they make their vaunt, that they can conquer the
world. Therefore dare they attempt to bid battle living in the world, to
religious men living out of the world, and still themselves be no worldlings.
Herein then consists the misery, which being discovered, any man may read the
riddle plain, scil. that for as much as the Benedictines had all or the most
part of the Abbey lands in England bequeathe unto their Monasteries, by sundry
devout, holy, and virtuous Catholic men and women in times past living in this
Realm: and for that the Dominicanes have the chair of authority for reading
in the schools (especially in Salamanca in Spain, which grieves these pure
spirited souls at the very heart: and what banding, brawling, and quarrelling
they have made with them about it, were too long to recite) and also to them
belongs of due right the sovereign authority of the sacred Inquisition, and
withal to be called Predicatores, preachers where ever they go, with an higher
prerogative, then ever any Jesuit could, or I hope ever shall have: for it
were dangerous and great pity that ever such ambitious men should obtain
such ample privileges. And lastly, for that the Scotists, Franciscanes,
(especially the Obseruants) have also had sundry Frieries here in England, as
also the Carthusians commonly called the Charterhouse Monks have had the like
in some sort. Therefore was there bona causa cur, none of all these or any
other religious order, that had ever enjoyed either house or land in Albions
I Will should ever come there again: or any other religious order that might live
without the Jesuits, for their sakes. But all of them as reprobates, and of God
forsaken must be banished hence, and a statute made in that high Council, that
none such should ever come within this land, after it is conquered by Spaniards
and Jesuits, sicut placuit Iesuitis.

The second Act enacted, or statute made in that high infernal Consistory,
was concerning the Church and Abbey lands, scil. That forasmuch as there be an
hundred Bishoprics great and small in these three kingdoms of England,
Scotland, and Ireland, with well nigh 20000. Parsonages and Vicariges: and how
many Monasteries, Nunneries, Frieries and other religious houses, it is hard to
tell the number. Notwithstanding there was a book brought into Paul's
Churchyard in written hand, to be bound up and sent (God knows where) into
Spain, as it may be thought (because the party that brought it was a sideman
of the Jesuits) the collection whereof, as it was there reported stood the party
in four hundred pounds. In which book (of a huge volume in a small hand)
there were set down all the religious houses that ever have been in this
Realm: what land was given unto them, where it yet lies, who gave it, how
long since, upon what condition and prouiso, when, by whom, how much, and
wherein altered, diminished, or increased: and in whose possession it is at
this present.

These with other circumstances and particulars being set down, no man can
judge otherwise, but it was a work fit for that Synodicall court to have the
perusing and censuring of it. And there (if any where) is their number of
religious houses like these to be found. All which as also nothing else
belonging either to the Ecclesiastical or Monastical state: must be any
longer in the hands of Bishops, Abbots, or other secular or religious persons,
as heretofore they were accustomed and incorporated unto their several orders.
But all must be under the holy society of Jesus, presently upon the
establishing of the spiritual monarchy. Which done, their father General or
Provincial must call out four Jesuits and two secular Priests, who must be
also demi Jesuits, else all were naught. These six Vicars (I pray God not of
hell, for of heaven they are not, they smell so ranckly of Cartwrights and
Bruses pure synodall ministry) like six Dutch Peers (of whom the Prophecies
talk) or so many mighty Lords, shall have the lands, manors, Lordships,
parsonages, monasteries, and what soever else belonged to Church or cloister,
resigned over into their hands: allowing to the Bishops, Parsons and Vicars,
competent stipends and pensions to live upon: according as Bishops Suffragans
and Montseniors have allowance in other Catholic countries, or rather as the
Turks, Bassaes, and Ianizaries under him are maintained. And all this sicut
placuit Iesuitis as the Romans in their leagues were wont to write: or rather
iuxta decretum Medorum atque Persarum a quo prouocare non licet, as king Darius
said. Livery and seisen thus taken by these six Tribunes or popular Nobles:
all the rest must be employed in pios vsus: as father General of Rome shall
think good. The Colleges in both Universities must be likewise in the power
of these mortified creatures. No Bishop, nor Parson, nor Vicar, nor fellow of
any College must be so hardy as once to demand an account what is become of
their revenues, lands and Lordships. If they do, this shall be the answer:
mirantur superiores, etc. or in plain terms: how dare you seem to inquire,
how a Jesuit disposes of any thing, being peculiarly guided by the Spirit,
etc.

The third Statute was there made concerning the Lords temporal and other of
the Nobility and Gentry of this land. And this Statute did consist of this
point especially: sci. That every Noble or Gentleman of special account and
living, such as (to omit others) Sir Robert Cicill, Sir John Fortescue, Sir
James Harington, Sir Robert Dormer, Sir John Arundell (now his son master
John Arundell called great Arundell of Cornwall) Sir John Peter, Sir Matthew
Arundell of Warder his son and heir, Sir Henry Constable, Sir John Savage,
with sundry other Knights and Esquires, all which were there limited by that
blind profane Parliament, what retinue they should keep when time came of
inhauncing, how much should be allowed them to spend yearly, and what diet
they should keep at their tables.

The fourth Statute was there made concerning the common laws of this land,
and that consisted of this one principal point, that all the great charter of
England must be burnt: the manner of holding lands in see-simple, free-taile,
frank Almaigne, etc. by Kings service, soccage or villanage, brought into
villainy, scoggerie, and popularitie: and in few, Often and often again must
the Jesuits arrogancy and deceitful dealings in every action, (transforming
themselves into Angels of light) be made known to the world, and inculcated
into the simple (and some wilfully blinded) ignorant peoples heads, that will
believe any thing they fable of against any secular Priest whosoever, be he
Seminary, Bishop, Card. or Pope, and yet will believe nothing on the
contrary, written or spoken by any whosoever against the^, though the affirmer
or apellant will ever seal it with his blood: which blind drowsy conceit of
many, does argue some horrible monster to be in breeding amongst them: whom
sundry of their fautor, will honor as a God. Otherwise sure they would never
be so besotted as to think, but that a religious man may be exorbitant, a wise
man forget himself, a bad liver creep into favor: and so Fa. Parsons to be
familiar with Princes, and yet a stark, etc. For what greater means to work
mischief, the^ wit and favor: what sooner deceives, and longer cloaketh
deceit, then a religious habit upon a lewd person? when does the Wolf rauine
more cruelly, then when he is clothed in a sheep skin? And when did ever any
heresy arise, but under zealous pretense, at the first of the churches
advancement? Then seeing a velvet hearse may cover a vile and stinking hide, a
noisome action abuse, an innocent mean, and a religious yea, and that truly, a
holy, and blessed order and habit, be abused by b^^ persons irreligiously
living in it. Let none hereafter be seduced with outward signs of religious
piety, where apparent verities are of iniquity.
the common laws must be wholly annihilated, abolished and trodden down under
foot, and Caesar's civil Imperials brought in amongst us, and sway for a time
in their places. All whatsoever England yields, being but base, barbarous, and
void of all sense, knowledge or discretion showed in the first founders and
legisers: and on the other side, all whatsoever is or shall be brought in by
those outcasts of Moses, stain of Solon, and refuse of Licurgus, must be
reputed for Metaphisicall, semie Divine, and of more excellency then the other
were.

The fifth statute there made, was concerning calumniation, not much unlike that
statute of Association: I mean in Father Parsons sense, as he in Greencoate
makes it seem to have been put in at the procurement of the Earl of
Leicester, or like the Proclamation he there talks of to have been made by his
Lordships procurement, against talkers of such great men's doings, as he was:
whilst be himself might calumniate and call in question whom he pleased. And
so conformably hereunto does this Jesuitical act of detraction or statute of
calumniation tend, scil. to bar all men from speaking of Fa. Parsons that
blessed live Saint, or any other Jesuit whosoever: they being such rare men, as
neither are their actions to be sifted, canuassed, or discountenanced by any
secular Priest whosoever (perhaps the Pope excepted if he keep silence, and
seem not to dislike of the^: which if he do not, have at him amongst the rest
with heave and hoe rumbelow:) neither can it be otherwise thought of, but as an
act and sign of an evil spirit, and unsound in religion for any one, that
dare take that course, they being religious men, nay Jesuits: and Fa. Parsons
of all the rest, the rarest wise man of our nation, most familiar with Princes,
admired at in Spain, reverenced in Italy, and only hated in England, which is
a sufficient argument of his integrity, and a manifest token of their evil
affection to the Catholic church and religion, that talk against him. This
collusion of Jesuitical sanctity caused a prouiso in the foresaid statute,
that whosoever did offend a Jesuit, or speak against this high council of
Reformation, it should be lawful for the Fathers, or their Syn-odicall
ministers to defame, destract and calumniate him or her at their pleasure, be,
who they shall be, Noble, Peer, or Prince, Bishop, Cardinal, or the Pope
himself. For which cause, and for the better understanding of the said
statute, they hold two propositions: one is, that detraction is lawful in
general: and so was it practiced at Wisbich by a Jesuit: affirming that there
were so many and grievous enormities there committed amongst the prisoners,
that Fa. Weston and his adherents were constrained to separate themselves from
the other Priests: and being charged to name some particulars, or if he could
not, he was to be reckned of for an injurious calumniator, and so therein to
have offended greatly in slaundering the whole house: he answered, nay: my
words were general, and therefore I offended none. Another proposition is for
particulars, scil. that whatsoever particular person be he private or public,
and that eminent or a chief, is directly bent against them, they never must
leave him, but calumniate, slander and invent new matter against him to death.
Thus did they calumniate Doctor Gifford, and malign him to this day (a man of
good desert, and of as many good parts, abilities and graces, as ever past the
seas in this age, and has not his better, if any be his equal, of any English
man, beyond the English Ocean now alive.) This reverend Priest then, for that
he did not admire these monsters, nor applaud with Panigeries of praises to
their worthless designments (for in very deed they had no other cause to
calumniate or dislike him) they presently devised sundry most vile and unjust
calumniations against him. They defamed him in England for a sower of sedition,
an informer against the Jesuits, and an exhibiter of the Memorial to the Pope.
They procured him to be examined before the Nuncio in the Low countries: and
failing of their purpose that way (the Nuncio after long delays, affirming in
plain terms, that he was wronged) one Fa. Baldwin (a turbulent fellow of a
Belial breed) dealt with the Nuncio for a general pacification, and remission
on all sides: and Fa. Baldwin in the name of Father Parsons and all the Jesuits
asked him forgiveness: So shameless are the Jesuits as the very pulpits are
profaned by them, when it stands them upon to maintain their reputation, per
fas aut ^efas they care not how, nor what tyranny they commit against any, as
poor Fisher (if alive) can witness: whom some say, they sent to the Galleys
at Naples (after they had got what from him as they cold) where he remained a
galley slave ever after, and so is full, if alive, or not murdered, as it is
lately repor^^d, by Parsons means in his way to Naples.
and the Doctor for his own part for civility sake, performing as much with
this addition: if he had offended any of them. Which being done, and the Nuncio
commanding them both to be secret of what had past (in favor indeed of the
Jesuits,) yet Father Baldwin gave it out in a glorious sort, that the Doctor
had asked Father Parsons and the Jesuits forgiveness: and thereby to disgrace
him a new, and to make their former injuries done unto him more probable, they
caused the same to be openly promulgated out of the pulpit in the College at
Rhemes.

The second particular calumniation (amongst an hundred now to be omitted) may
well be that against Doctor Lewis (a man so favored by diverse Popes, as first
he was made Montseigneur, then Bishop of Cassana, afterward Nuncio for Gregory
the fourteenth to Lucerna, and then Visitor general of Rome and all the Popes
dominions. Note here these base Politicians ingratitude: they having received
by him many very extraordinary benefits; as by his procurement they got the
Rectorship of the English Seminary in Rome. Furthermore, when 22. of them were
to be banished out of the city of Perugio, for their cousinage to have
enriched themselves there: one of them being notoriously detected, for alluring
a Gentlewoman to give them a very rich chain of gold, without her husbands
priuitie: (as a very like case fell out at Leege in low Germany, these fine
fingred fig boys are so nimble about Ladies and Gentlewomens jewels:) this
prudent good Bishop being their general Visitor, used such means, as all was
hushed up, and they continued there still. Notwithstanding all which with many
like benefits received at his hands, A vile part of Fa. Parsons, and others,
that, because the blessed man this good Bishop, now in heaven, disliked of the
Jesuits government, and their governors in the English Col. at Rome, they
should publish libels against him here in England after his death:
notwithstanding that the holy Bishop within four hours before his death, upon
occasion protested, that he had been most falsely charged with upholding and
maintaining of the Students in the English Seminary against the Jesuits. Yea
it is well known that whilst he was ali^^, he might have curbed many of that
insole^t crew, being their Visitor general. But a milder man lived not, nor
more apt to put up and forgive al injuries, and eue^ of purpose he refrained to
visit that crew, because knowing their hard co^ceits of him, he would not give
the^ any occasion to say he was partial, if he had dealt so roundly with the^
as they deserved: yet all was one: nay, it is far better to be an open enemy
to their cursed designments, then to conniue, and be a flattering current of
their fatal course. For it is a rule with them, Quinon est nobis^^^ contra nos
est, etc.
yet the kind fathers could not endure him: and this only, because he disliked
their courses and practices in their garboiles at Rome about the Students in
the English Seminary. And so extreme is their malice where they once take
displeasure, as their wrath and indignation is intolerable, though it be for
never so small a trisle: which this good Bishop found most true. For whilst he
was alive, they caused their disciples to rail upon him most spitefully,
calling him a factious, seditious, and most partial man. And a little before
his death they cast out a libel against him, wherein they had laid many
horrible crimes to his charge: and amongst other things made this devout prayer
for him (full like their charity toward all good men) scil. aut mors aut
Turca, aut Deus aut Diabolus eripiat cum a nobis: which cursed letter came to
his hands, who heartily forgave it the^. But being dead, when in all humanity,
their hatred should have been buried with him: yet ceased they not to follow
the pursuit of their impiety in persecuting his happy memory with their
Jesuitical calumniations, and that most irreligiously. Yea that impious
caitise Fa. Parsons in a letter dated the 13. of July, 1598. and sent into
England, not to be kept secret: writes of this good Bishop thus after his sly
fashion: scil. A third cause (says Father Parsons) there was (meaning of the
Students opposing of themselves against the Jesuits) no less important,
perhaps then any of the rest, or more then both together, which was a certain
disgust given at the very foundation of the College, unto a certain
principal man of our nation and his friends, then reside^t in Rome. Who
afterward not affecting greatly the government, or governors of that College,
was ever in re, or in opinion a back to them that would be discontented, etc.
Where by the way all men may see, that the secular Priests here in England have
not alone disliked of the Jesuitical government, governors and political, or
rather Atheall designments.

A third calumniation in particular, was of that most renowned Prelate and
blessed Cardinal, Doctor Allane: a man in whose very countenance was pourtraid
out a map of political government indeed, stained with a sabled dye of
gravity, sublimated with a reverend majesty in his looks, yielding favor,
and forcing fear, (the true allurements of affections in admirable aspects of
worlds wonders, as the memory of former, glory of these, and honor of future
ages) one most reverenced of our nation, and worthily reverenced of us, (one or
two actions excepted, whereunto he was drawn by Fa. Parsons exorbitant courses
and impudency:) of whom Pope Gregory of holy memory said to his Cardinals:
Venite fratres mei, ostendam vobis Alanum: as much to say, as: I will show you
a man, in Anglia borne, to whom all Europe may give place for his high
prudence, reverend countenance and purport of government. This blessed
Cardinal then whom all admired, and none could justly blame: yea even our
common adversaries did commend his mild spirit in comparison of Doctor
Saunders, both writing about one time: but with a far different drift, intent
and manner of proceeding. His Grace never liked of inuading, conuersions of
countries with bloody blades. And howsoever he was drawn (as weried out with
impostors, exprobrations and expostulations of father Parsons and others of
that hot spirited unnatural tribe of Dan. Coluber in via,) to some odious
attempts against his dread Sovereign and dear country, both which he with no
less loyalty honored then dearly affected in his best thoughts: yet
afterward he retired himself from those seditious courses, mightily
condemning and contemning all such factious dispositions in his very heart, as
apparently was known before his death. His words, writings, and all his
actions did ever tend to lenity: so as he was often wont to say, that seeing
England was lost and gone from her ancient faith, by reason of our forefathers
offenses, neither clergy nor laity, secular nor religious, noble nor ignoble,
man, woman nor child being free: it was to good sense that we and all their
posterity should be punished, and remain in desolation, until by virtuous and
good life it might please our most merciful Lord and redeemer to auert his
wrath from our country, and to incline our Sovereign Lady and Queen to look
upon our afflictions, and to commiserate our miseries, we seeking for none
other worldly joy nor comfort here on earth, Note here the malicious policies
of these wicked men the Jesuitical faction, against Cardinal Allane for
retiring himself from their traitorous plots of invasion: how maruellously
they maligned him ever after. Insomuch that being desirous on his death bed to
have had all the English students come unto him, this father Rector would in no
case yield unto it, perhaps the better to color the Jesuits barbarous cruel^y,
used in the suspected poisoning of him, and after fathering of it most
ridiculously, but maliciously enough upon the holy Bishop of Cassana. But God
will one day judge all hypocrites, and bring their secret mischiefs to light.
but only to serve our Lord God without vexation or trouble, voiding our
thoughts of all mundane honors and preferments, either in the Church or
commonwealth: and leaving them freely to the present Incumbents, without once
seeming to claim any interest therein, etc. To this same effect are his words
in the English Apology, wholly, and altogether disauowing all these
treasonable, treacherous, and factious courses and manner of proceedings in the
Jesuits, and living always thus untouched by any, either for government, life
or doctrine, yet in the end, he was touched most egregiously by them, and that
only, and for none other cause in the world, then for that in very deed, he
seeing daily further into them, then erst he had seen, did not only retire
himself from their ways, but showed dislike with disfavor, of their bad
dealings toward the end of his mortal life. Whereupon that they might be even
with him one way or other, they gave out sundry disgraceful words against him:
as that he was a good simple man, but not of any esteem or reckning in matters
of state affairs handled in the Popes Consistory: a man of weak judgment,
shallow wit, and small advice: and never used but a little for some matters of
learning, and that in positive only, not in any school point: yea so great
was their hatred toward him, upon this slender and small occasion as you see
given them, as it was verily thought by many in Rome that he was poisoned. And
the suspicion thereof was so great, that father Rector then Hieronimo
Florauantio a Jesuit, to drive the conceit another way into peoples hearts,
labored to have turned that foul irregular fact from the Jesuits to the good
Bishop of Cassana: but in vain the entire affection of these two worthy
Prelates, being well known to all the world: and the Cardinals words unto the
said Bishop not long before, declaring well from whence these mischiefs,
garboiles, seditions and contentions first did spring, and still were continued
on and maintained: when he said on a time after a long and sad talk had
betwixt them concerning the students and Jesuits: Well (quoth the good
Cardinal) Abraham and Loath were both good men, but yet their shepherds could
not agree: meaning that how intrinsecall soever they two were together, yet the
seditious and turbulent persons under them would still be brabling, supplanting
and maligning those that would feign live quiet by them.

Upon the death of this so memorable a person, they openly triumphed, insulted
over the dead corpse, and gloried in their conceited victory: giving it out
amongst others their Jesuitical calumniations against him, that he was well
gone, and that God had taken him away in good time. For if he had lived but a
while longer, he would have disgraced himself, shamed his country, and lost
the credit which he had gotten.

It follows here in order from Deanes to Bishops, All you fond affectionates
of the Jesuitical tribe, note herein your own partial doom. And whether
these paultry polititia^s persuading you to think it so odious a matter to
call any of the in question for what offense soever: should be left free to
talk of all men from the highest to the lowest at their pleasure: and if they
do but wag their singer at the^ to persecute him to death. If this be well
either in them to do so, or in you to think and sway so partially on their
sides: ve^ indicatote.
and from Bishops to Cardinals, that the fourth calumniatio^ in particular,
must be against the supreme dignity and chief person, in and of the Church
Catholic of Christ: wherein they verify daily the impudent speech of a puny
Jesuit to a secular Priest at Rome, in these words, Dare you (quoth he) meaning
the students, presume to discountenance, contend withal, or seem to dislike
of the fathers doings, or designements in any thing, whom the greatest Princes
in Christendom stand in awe of, and will not, neither dare offend them, being
sure to hear of it to the uttermost, if they do but hold up their finger
against them? Which speech in the conclusion serves fitly to our purpose: to
show it as manifestly as the day light at noonetide, that who and whenever
any, be he Pope or Prince or other Monarch, does not favor their Jesuitical
allobrogickes, although he do no way stir against them: yet for that he
runs not with them, or on foot by them like a lackey-boy in a French Ioupe,
(so rudely arrogant, are these lewd companions to challe^ge all Princes favors,
to patronage their barbarous outrages,) he shall be sure to have, heart, head
and pen, yea and hands to (if it come to banding, canuasing and grapling) laid
upon him, until both ears and cheeks shall burn with infamies. In testimony
whereof their presumptuous proceedings against the Sea Apostolic for a small
and light check (God-wot) given to one of them by Pope Sixtus, is worthy to be
registered, recorded and deuoluted to all posterity, to mark and single them
out for the most malicious, traitorous and irreligious calumniators that ever
lived on earth, unworthy that ever the earth should bear them, and an
intolerable indignity to the whole Church of God, that ever such wicked
members should live unpunished in her as they do. But to the relation.

Xistus Quintus then of holy memory, called before him on a time the General
of the Jesuits, and demanding of him why they called themselves Jesuits: he
answered, that they did not call themselves so: but Clearkes only of the
society of Jesus. Then the Pope replying, said: but why should you appropriate
to your selves to be of the society of Jesus, more then all other Christians
are: Note here by the way that a name is given to the followers of a
prothoplast or first Author of a profession two manner of ways: ^^e by reason
of h^^ doctrine, as Ar^^ans of Arius, Donatists of Donatus etc. And an other by
reason of his manners, habit and moral course of life, as Basilians of Saint
Basil, Anthonians of Saint Anthony: Franciscans of S. Francis, etc. The first
concerning doctrine, does always denotate an heretik because it is about
matters of faith. The second, concerning life and manners, does ever denotate
some religious orders, professio^s or society, that have taken themselves to
that course of life, to save their souls by keeping the rules set down by the
first founder of that order. Of whom for that cause they ever after take the
name.
of whom in general the Apostle says, vocati sumus in societatem filij eius?
To this no answer being made, his Holiness urged further, saying: And whereas
the Benedictines are so called of their first author Benedictus, and the
Dominicans of Saint Dominicke their founder: why should not you be called
Ignatians of Ignatius the first author of your society and order? And besides
why do you not withal (if you will be holden for religious men) keep the
quiet, rise at midnight, and do in all things as religious men should, are
bound, and ordinarily every where do? These words of his Holiness, the
Jesuits took so disdainefully, scornefully and contemptuously, as he lived but
a short while after: and (here to omit what has been reported) since his
departure out of this life to blisle eternal, they have not ceased most
maliciously (according to their accustomed envious and inhumane manner) to
deprave him: they have preached openly against him in Spain: they have called
the manner of his death in question: and they have reported, that at his
departure he had no confessor with him: Yea they have seemed to make it a
matter of damnation to endeavor to bring some Jesuits into order, without great
penance done for that bold attempt against such illuminates, and men sitting
near under God Almighties knee, so familiarly acquainted with the sacred
deity as they are. Nay which few, or I think no heretic did ever affirm
lawful to be admitted of in any ordinary Bishop, a base miscreant of that
Jesuitical faction, upon some opposition found on his Holiness behalf (no
true Catholics heart enduring to hear Christ his Vicar on earth, being so
worthy a Bishop in his time as whiles Rome is Rome his worthy works will
sound forth his best deserved praises) in answer to certain objections made
against sundry slanderous reports of this varlet (as he may well be termed in
respect of any order) used of that worthy Pope: he fell to the maintaining of
this most vile, Atheall and Heathenish assertion, scil. Hominem non Christianum
posse esse Romanum Pontificem.

Which proposition stands either unrepealed in this high Council of
Reformation whereof now we treat or yet vnrecalled, or the miscreant censured
by the graund master Archpriest for it: who is so ready a double diligent to
send abroad his fribooters and flying out censures and inhibitions against
others words and writings, in discovering these Antikes in their right colors.
The like to this has been their arrogant speech against Pope Clement the
eighth that now is: against whom, notwithstanding that his Holiness has been
hitherto thought to be the greatest fauorer and countenance to them of any that
has been since their insolency first began to be noted, and their ambition
disliked: they have most ungratefully showed their accustomed wrath and
indignation in calumniating of him in the highest degree of a dangerous
detraction: and upon as light a ground and small a quarrel picked against his
Holiness as against his predecessor or any other Pope, the circumstances
considered: Father Parsons in Greenceate made (as some thought) a reasonable
motion to her Majesty to give leave to her honorable Council to call the
Earl of Leicester to his accounts, making no doubt but so to muzzell the Bear
(as he says) by that means, as he might be led with rope and ring, and tied
to the stake quietly, that her Majesty might handle him as she pleased,
agreeing to his deserts, whereas he was and would be still so unruly otherwise,
as none should sleep in quiet for him. But now if his Holiness would but grant
the like free admittance of every one to speak what they know against this
insolent society, and suffer the Inquisitio^ to pass on them according to
justice: I think not England only, but all Christendom would be and live more
quiet and peaceably together ever after.
for thus it was.

The Bishop of Cassana (so often mentioned) being the general Visitor in Rome,
of all religious men amongst other orders and societies, he had many
accusations exhibited unto him by the Jesuits, one against another, and many
petitions made unto his Lordship: with earnest desire to have him come and
visit them. For howsoever they agree together here in England (which yet is
not as the ignorant multitude believes of them, and more probably they may
agree better together here then any where else besides, by reason that they
have a colorable excuse to say, that the dissension is amongst seculars only
and the lay Catholics, whiles the seed-cariers of these contentions are either
close Jesuits, and so will not be known, or at least such Iesuited faultors of
their policies, as they like discord the devil can set secular Priests at
debate so covertly as it shall hardly be discerned to be their doing:) yet are
they now both here and there pretily well deciphered out: so as it will not
seem strange hereafter of most monstrous acts committed amongst them, and one
against another: as there in Rome their libels and complaints exhibited to the
Visitor general do declare it. The good Bishop therefore moved with these
complaints and iarres that were amongst them, as a man no less pious, then
prudent in all his actions: knowing well the bad dispositio^s, seditious
humors, ra^cor, and malice of the me^ against him, or any other that should seek
to reform them: howsoever upon the spleen they sought for it at that time: he
acquainted Pope Clement with it. Whereupon at the next general Chapter held by
the Jesuits, his Holiness attended on with the said Bishop visitor, and four
or five other Bishops besides, went into their house: took a serious view of
all things, and sharply rebuked them for their pride, their disorderly
apparel, and their prodigality in all things: very roundly charging them in
plain terms to be more humble, and to frame the course of their lives
hereafter more like religious men then they did at that present. Which condign
admonition (but nothing near sufficient correction, to pull down such
unmortified haughty hearts) how it was taken, the effects since have showed
it: A notable jest, if a Pope could err in absoluing the king of France upon
an informatio^ of his Divines: and yet (forsooth) it is blasphemy to say that
Cardinal Caietane could er in appointing master Blackwel to be an Archpriest
by false suggestion, misinformation and cogging of the Jesuits. Sed spectatum
admissi risum teneatis amici: let who as list be blinded with these patches:
while I live all their vain applauses nunquam clamabunt in gutture meo.
some of their society having since been so bold with his Holiness, as
peremptorily to affirm, that he erred in absoluing the French King great
Henry that now is, the most Christian King, being deceived therein by his
Divines. Wherein you must note by the way, that the Jesuits (as it should
seem) were not of the Popes counsel in that action, to have given his
Holiness better instruction, information, and direction for that matter. And
therefore that absolution being given without their consents, likings or
allowing of, how could it stand firm, or be without manifest error, as of
necessity it could not choose if the Church be wholly with them, and that they
are the true, perfect and only guides of souls. But the truth was indeed,
that the said absolution did so much tend to the overthrow of the Jesuitical
platform, under color of prejudice to the King of Spain and their
designements with him: as no marvel if they did so much calumniate it, and do
the like still against the whole realm of France for his sake. For what is it
that they dare not do by their general rule in ordine ad Deum.

Now if these good fellows may presume thus far with so famous persons and
men of mark, If these fellows have the reins laid on their necks, and be
suffered to run forward with the bit in their teeth a little longer, they
will hardly be reclaimed without great danger of Apostasy. Such is their
extreme pride, and haughtiness of mind.
as with Bishops, Cardinals, and Popes themselves: what can poor men expect at
their hands that will not do and dye what, and when they list? But yet withal
this is a comfort (and under benedicite be it spoken) when certain of my
dear, loving, and tender hearted friends, have sometimes with tears bewailed
unto me my hard fortune to be tormented by the Jesuits (as I think none in
England has been more,) this was to me the greatest consolation I ever found:
to have such great bugges combind with beggars, and such admired at worthies,
to be consorted with such miserable wretches as my self: and to undergo with
me and many more poor afflicted, the spite of their malicious tongues, and
extreme rage and fury against all men without exception of person, time and
place.

The sixth statute in this foresaid high Court or Council of Reformation may
very well be called a statute of retractation of slander, which is a hot
counterblast to the former horneblast of calumniation: and it goes under the
tenor of a prouiso: that if such, or such things do happen, then the person or
persons before defamed, detracted, calumniated, contemned, and condemned ad
inferos on live, Some things there are where in the Jesuits ^^^ernement and
policy were to be commended: were they either mere tempor^ll men, ^^b^t lay
bro^hers, or in some ^a^e secular Priests or else the spiritual of the
Ecclesiastical state: but when a man shall reflect upon these words
monastical, religious, and men of perfection mortified in all thing; then alas
for pure shame, I blush at their insolency, usurpation and abuse of
themselves, and their society.
shall be as highly exalted, extolled, advanced and elevated ad caelos after
their death. And this is an apothegmaticall rule of as political a
stratagemitor as I think has been in any age precedent to ours: so full of
mystical A dages, as every word when it comes to a pragmaticall practice, has
close couched in it the enargy of a Senecall sentence. The drift whereof is
marvelous full of fine policy, and in truth if any thing be commendable, or
to be freed from Atheism in a Jesuitical platform, for the advancement of
their society, abstracted from a religious faith and habit (which marreth all
the market) this is doubtless one, and such a one as deserves an
hierogliphicall emblem with a conceit in chief. But because it were too long
to stand upon every apothegmaticall sentence, rule, clause, and enterclause to
be observed how, when, by whom, for what cause, to what persons, of what
matter, with what intent: and how far a man may proceed (for omne nimium
vertitur in vitium: therefore will I set you down the case stark naked
uncased into a canuase by three or four examples agreeing to the purpose.

The prouiso in the statute is this: scil. whereas before it was agreed upon,
that a father of the society might authorize any of his substitutes or
confederates, or of himself, detract, defame, and calumniate any person that
should seem opposite to their holy designements, this being thought very
convenient for the present: now be it further enacted thus: that for and in
consideration of the premises to advance the father by traducing all others
through discommends of all their talents, abilities, and graces in government,
learning, discretion, virtue and policy, it may be lawful not only to take
away their good name, but even also their life if need require, propter bonum
societatis. Provided always that if the party before defamed be dead, or bis
back broken with slanders or other mishap, so as he is never able to rise to
any honor afterward: and withal if now the advancement of his credit
(before disgraced notoriously, for another intent and meaning) may serve their
turns to work some inconvenience or hinderance to a third person whom
likewise they do malign and hate: That then and in that case (the party
especially being out of the way, and thereby incapable of the honor which
happily inter viuos might accrue unto him, through the panegiries of such
praises) they should leave no stone unremoved to extol him above Saint Paul's
heaven, where he saw that which was not to be revealed to men on earth. This
then being the prouiso of the case: now follows the examples of the canuase.

After the death of Cardinal Allane, the Jesuits fearing least Doctor Lewis
Bishop of Cassana should have had his place and been made Cardinal, there were
diverse patheticall discourses in conference used of that worthy Prelate where
soever they came: with many mournful objects presented to conceit of his
loss, if such a person should be preferred unto his place: and amongst the
rest these were special impressions by them imprinted in affectionate hearts
toward his Grace and their holies: scil. It was there objected what emnitie
this Bishop bare to their society: how that he stirred up all their garboiles
in the English College at Rome: and that he never could endure the said
Cardinal his Grace: but was ever his vowed enemy, and one that had wrought him
much spite, woe, and grief in his days. And to make this political canuase
go current (or rather Machiuilean platform, I could find in my heart to term
it) to blemish the good opinion had of the Bishop (thereby to trumpe in his
way, until they might get him triced out of their way) they entered into a
large discourse of the Cardinals extraordinary singularities. They spared not
then to spread it abroad (as men that had worshipped Cardinal Allane for a
Saint, Many words, confessio^s, and reports made, and given out by the Scribes
and Pharisees, and the Devil himself of our Savior Jesus Christ were good,
lust and true: but yet they did the same to a wicked end. So these good
fellows the Jesuits dealt with the Cardinal, making a true report of him in all
things here recited, save the last, that they reverenced him, at we say the
devil loves holy water: for even so they deemed nothing less of him then their
words imported, but what they did, and said therein, was to hinder the Bishop
from the preferment they feared would be laid upon him. And thus like Pharisees
do they deal: Sed piece ^^ori dixit Deus, quare tu enarras iustitias meas
sede^s aduersus fratrem tuum loquebaris, and a luersus filium matris tuae
po^ebas scand^lam, etc.
and loved his memory in their hearts as a holy shrine) how beneficial his
Grace had been to their College: how highly he was esteemed of, and respected
of all princes in Europe, that either knew him by sight, or else had heard of
him by any passage of memorable speech: how dearly accounted of, and deeply
affected of sundry Popes, as well his Holiness then in supreme esse, as his
predecessors of all holy memory. How all his whole study, chief endeavors,
and greatest care, was ever bent for the good of his country: for reducing of
the same to the Catholic faith, and for the comfort of the afflicted, here and
there and every where? To what high dignities he was advanced: how well he
merited his place and calling: and how greatly honored in the Court of Rome:
how much admired at by the rest of the Cardinals: in what possibility to have
been Pope, and how reverenced by themselves the Jesuits, etc. Thus charitably
they dealt with the good Cardinal after he was dead, and that they were sure
their praises given out of him could not then obfuscate, obscure, nor abolish
one jot of their pre-eminence, or mirificall designements. The like example to
this might be a correspondent, and evident favor showed to the said Bishop
after his death, as the former was after the Cardinals death. For according to
the philosophical Axiom, as contraria iuxta se posita magis elucescunt: so
virtue and vice having such a dissocietie by consequence of kind, that the one
follows the other like form and privation. Hereupon it comes that (faith and
hope failing) charity never dies but goes to heaven with the happily
possessed therewith: so his opposite vice, envy, neither ever dies, but goes
to hell with the cursed soul infected therewith at her death. For this cause
then it is plain, that as these men never spoke well of the Cardinal after
his death for any love they bare unto him: so neither did they use the like
good speech of the Bishop, for any entire affection toward his Lordship: but
that which they did, was thereby to hinder and discountenance the said Bishop
of Cassanaes nephew Montseigneur Hugh Grissin. Which to perform
stratagemically, they commended his said Uncle exceedingly, to insinuate
thereby, that he did far degenerate from his Uncles virtues. And a very like
canuasse is all the whole discourse of Fa. Parsons in Doleman, conferred with
his practice about the bequest of the English Crown, now extolling Scotlands
title to the skies: and then abasing it in the presence of Spain. To day all
wholly for the house of Austria: to morrow as forward for the house of Parma.
Now fawning upon Derbie to bring Earl Ferdinand to destruction: and then upon
Essex to stir up Earl Robert to rebellion: and still in the mean by
intercourse of parlee with any, who either by their greatness may comport
with his ambition, or whom he by his platform may couple withal, to bring
this whole Isle to a popular confusion. In all which treasonable practices,
seeing he has always used one to another disgrace, by praise and dispraise
as time and occasion prick him forward, with affiance in one more then in
another for his societies advancement, not sparing Spain it self (when any
hope was by any other mean) but to insinuate in plain terms, that his
advice was for the mobile vulgus in England, to choose and set up a Soueraign,
it made no matter who amongst them, when opportunity should be offered:
affirming boldly that he liked not of the Spaniard, as heretofore he had liked,
neither saw any hope to come by their means: Yet making the royal issue of
King Philip still his dogbolt, when all other hopes did quail, and helps did
fall him: there is none that reads his libels, and conferres them with his
practice, but shall easily discern, that he would not be improuident of
setting down this statute of Retractation of slander, as a prouiso, in that
high Council of Reformation for England, that being the master trump he had
to play, for the maine chance of his conceited Monarchy: and the only bolt
that would serve his turn, if any could in time of need, to drive the
bunting to the baye.

I might here add a fourth example of this prouiso, out of the practice of
that simple misled man Master George Blackwell the new Archpriest of England:
nay, the Subuiceroy rather of all the Isles of Albion. Master Blackwell a
plain simple man, always full of sentences in his writings (as one who has
very probably flores sententiaruus tum Philosophoru^, etc.) by reason whereof,
wanting a head for invention, discourse or judgment, his sententious letters
are often evil couched in delivery of his mind, by a long passage written
togetherward of one matter. But of nature being at the first, and for many
years together, by report of those that knew him, very humble, scrupulous, and
affable, became some 3. or 4. years before his miraculous advancement, so
testie, peremptory, etc. (I will leave it there) that there was no ho with
him: no servant could dwell in the house with the widow (questionless a
virtuous Gentlewoman otherwise) where he lived: no nor yet her own children
have but what he judged meet for them, etc. was not so hot against the Jesuits
(especially Fa. Parsons in time of his natural and priestly secular mildness:
but now is become as furious against the said seculars, since his heart was
smitten by Mercuries melancholy (yet Iesuitically gilded) caduceus. Thus
times go by turns, honores mutant ^ores, and sic transit gloria mund^, to men
of no deserts.
This plain Polipragmon (as none more elated in conceit of their own proper
excellency, then an ignorant body advanced to immerited, vnexcepted, and
inconceited dignity) having either heard of, or belike had received this
statute of Retractation (sent from Rome by heart) or a like unto it taught him
per coeur. For before that time none seemed to mislike more of the Jesuitical
course and proceedings then he, nor spoke more suspiciously against some of
them in particular: especially against Father Parsons by name: whose coming
into England being known, Master Blackwell bewailed the same very tenderly to
a friend of his then in prison; saying: that the President at Rhemes (meaning
Doctor Allane) played a very indiscreet part to send him hither: as being an
unfit man to be employed in the causes of religion. And being asked why he was
unmeet for that employment, he answered: because his casting out of Baliol
College, and other articles and matters depending upon it, betwixt him and
Doctor Squire (then living) were very likely to be renewed: and so to work
great discredit both to him and the cause Catholic. Thus stood the case then
with Master Blackwell; now see the canuasse for Retractation of this slander
given out of so stately a Polipragmon.

This simple man quite altered in nature, manners and conversation, by reason
of strong drink, private close living, and familiarity with some fathers of
that society, became an officious Agent, libeller-like to Rome, by writing
against his brethren the seculars: enticed I make no question of it by some
cony-catching devise of Fa. Parsons, thereby intending to be his bane at
length: as his new magisteriall office at his procurement instituted, will be
(no doubt of it) the only means to plague him, in revenge of his former
speeches used against the said father. Who should quite forget himself, his
principles of Machiauell, and all his rules of policy, if Master Blackwell
escape scotfree after all the Jesuits turns are served, by such a blockish
instrument, as cannot perceive their mumbling meaning: as resting wholly at
their devotion to stand or fall? Yet so it is now, as whether drowned in vain
delight of his new supremacy, or otherwise inueigled to be a close Jesuit (as
sundry such there are, which going under the name of seculars, make the said
seculars cause seem more odious, weak and exorbitant: or howsoever it comes
to pass, Master Blackwell sings now placebo domino meo Parsonio in terra
viuentium for the time: and lays me on load upon every opposite to a
Jesuits designement. Now he condemns all, as suspended and irregular
persons, that either directly or indirectly maintain, write or speak in
defense of the censure of Paris, which cleared the seculars from schism,
sin, and all other crime or offense in the first resistance of his
Archpresbitership: and then again threateneth all with thundering sentences of
Ecclesiastical censures, that speak, confer, procure or seek for any
redress against his ignorant cruelty, appointed of purpose (and either does
not or will not know it) to be slagellum fratrum suorum: yea a scourge to
himself and all England besides. It is strange to consider, how now he be
labors himself in laying about him on all sides, to defend the never heard of
more impudent, shameful, and palpably ignominious, It is but a sign of a
dastardly mind, and most unfit to be in authority, to persecute those most,
whom all men note to be freest from offense: and yet such as by reason of a
humerous, tender and scrupulous heart they carry, are easi jest overcome, and
forced to yield. For example whereof, get and read all the passage by letters
and messages betwixt the Archpriest and Ma. More, etc.
reproachful, and abominable facts of Fa. Parsons, and the rest of the
Jesuits. And especially he tyrannizeth, if he find a sweet nature, and mild
disposition any way opposite unto him: such a one as Master Thomas More a very
reverend secular Priest, of many good parts and abilities: who (as I have heard
of late) has fared worse for my sake, which I am very sorry for, though
outwardly there was made no show of it, for I could tell perhaps why. I can no
less admire, how that ever wise men should be so blinded, as not to discern
(which many do not) then smile in my sleeue to think how bravely they have
bobd this double diligent M. Blackwell with this statute of Retractation of
slander: whereby if ever it come to hearing, he is as sure to be hoysted over
the bar for an ambidexter, by comparing his former speech to his present
proceedings, as I am sure to have written, and set it down here for a looking
glass unto him, with this emprise above it tristitia vestra, trust to your
self good Ma. Blackwell, and forsake in time that seditious company, who move
you to act, write and speak you know not what against your self, as one day
you will find it.

I could here particulate this statute (but it were too tedious to do so) more
exactly in discovery of M. Blackwels ignorance and simplicity. Who whiles I
was in Scotland, sent out an inhibition against all such books (printed per
Biennium etc. by any Catholics means or procurement within these two Realms
of England or Scotland) as either might exasperate our common adversaries here,
or otherwise prejudice the worthy laborers in our common causes, that had
merited so well of their country and all Catholics as Father Parsons had: for
he was the famous man and I the infamous wretch whom all men judged that speech
to be intended for, as no doubt it was, and that by instigation of his good
spirit Fa. Garnet, to stop thereby the answer to Fa. Parsons Doleman of
succession to the English Crown, which then they knew I went about. A copy of
which schedule being sent unto me by a friend out of England to Edenborough
where then I lay: I could not tell well whether to laugh or be angry, to see
the slinesse, craft and policy of the Jesuits, to put such a sharp sword of
Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, into a raw, simple and mad man's hands: as if the
point had not bin blunted, and the edge turned by abuse of his authority
(never rightly had, and many ways since justly lost, as will be proved against
him) he would have killed all that ever came in his (I should say the Jesuits)
way, and himself unnaturally therewith as I fear he has already. For amongst
other errors committed by him in that inhibition, this was one, scil. that he
would suffer all Parsons seditious books to pass current, as his Philopator,
speaking most rebelliously against her Majesty, and the whole State and Nobles
of this land: his Doleman, entituling most traitorously the Spanish Infanta to
the English Crown: together with his Appendix fathered on Cardinal Allane
being dead: his Letter to the Marquis Huntley (to creep in again with
Scotland, but sent through England to be huffed, ruffed and vanted of) and
sundry other of his confederates libels, lette^s, and messages (matter enough
to have moved a Saint to anger, much more a mortal wight to be exasperated
thereby:) and knowing (as he could not choose but know it) that I sought nothing
less then to exasperate either my Sovereign or present State, but all quite
contrary, to confute all and whatsoever he had written, leaving the question
undecided and fault where it was, in him and his clearly to be seen: yet he
to forbid both printing and reading of mine, and extolling the other to the
skies, what a man should think hereof it may be easily discerned. An other
error therein was; in that his authority (if he had any, and that it were not
lost again) did extend only to the censure and allowance of such books as
were of matters of Religion and Ecclesiastical government and discipline: so as
this book I then was thought to be in hand withal was out of his commission
to meddle or deal with, either in allowing or forbidding the reading or
printing of it. A third was, his presumptuous boldness, in that he would by
virtue of his authority (suppose it were such, so great and so inuiolate as he
takes upon him to have it) intrude himself to meddle with forbidding books to
be either read or printed in Scotland, without either asking leave, or at least
giving the Catholic Bishop of Glasco to understand thereof beforehand. A
fourth was, the insinuated suspicion of a Praemunire he has incurred already
(he may thank his good fathers for it) by his authority to be increased
hereby, as seeking by this inhibition of printing or reading of any book that
may touch a Jesuit, (especially that so dangerous a Polipragmon Father
Parsons) he shows plainly that he would have all the treasonable practices
concealed, not regarding what danger of both body, soul and commonwealths
wrack happen to any, so as these new Fathers may have their wicked
designements. Many other particular points have I noted, as being collected by
necessary sequel to ensue upon that Letter: whereof in the Apology I intend
to imptint of mine own peculiar purgations I mean to treat at large. Only
this for the present he may please to know: that I never writ nor spoke word in
my life, that I dare not publish in any Court of Christendom concerning these
matters: so far I am from all fear of exasperating any Prince or Peer, or
incurring of any danger either in England (which I am bound in all respects
to my dread Sovereign and native land to be most wary of offending or hurting
any manner of way) or elsewhere. And if, as I have suppressed the printing of
that book and sundry others for a time: let him not think it came upon any
account or reckening I made of his suspension for that cause: but for other
reasons which he and his may and yet do both miss of: though some of his
assistants have taken upon them to know the causes why. And hereupon one of
them of a brauado has made his vaunt since my return last out of Scotland,
that he (another manner of man then I poor wretch to deal with Princes) has
written to his Majesty King James, exhorting him to embrace the Catholic
faith and religion: Were it not that the Jesuits have a special privilege in
two things: one is, to make all things to be believed as Gospel be it never so
falls that they speak or write: another to make al things to be judged false be
it as true as the Gospel it self that any other shall write or speak without
their approbation. But if directly against them: out upon it, it is not to be
heard, spoken of, or once looked upon. If these were not, and withal, that the
vilest parts that can be played are counted acts of zeal amongst them if done
by a Father: so as it may be any way covered with either of their two
principles, scil. propter bonum societatis, vel ordine ad Deum: otherwise I
should greatly muse at the fair gloss of father Southwell concerning father
Parsons birth and education. It being most untrue that Fa. Southwell reports of
him, scil. that having placed the uttermost of his ambition in the contempt of
honor; and the highest of his wealth in voluntary poverty, will easily
acknowledge his birth to have been of more honest then great parents. Yet were
they not so mean, but they were able to afford him such education as might
have made his good parts a way to no small preferment, etc. All which is most
false, a bastard he was: unhonestly begot, basely borne, a Wolsey in ambition,
a Midas in mundicitie, a traitor in action; which here I had not touched, had
he spared his own Sovereign and blood royal of this land.
which if he do, then all, all, all, every true Catholic should take his part
for the English Crown by this new statists procurement. But what answer he had
let himself report. I think it will be but a scorn, and he laughed at for a
stale, in showing his exorbitant audacious folly.

I may not here forget a fifth Statute, which I make no question of but that
Father Parsons would be most careful to have it thoroughly perfected in that
high Council of Reformation for England: and it is to be thought that it goes
also under the tenure of a prouiso for legitimation of bastards. For we may not
imagine that Father Parsons was ignorant of his own base estate, as being a
sacrilegious bastard in the worst sense, scil. a spurias begotten by the Parson
of the Parish where he was borne, upon the body of a very base queen. This
then being so, and he not so senseless as to think but that he will find the
Canon law more strict in dispensatio^ with him for his irregularity, then the
Civil or common law will be for dispensation to inherit, etc. (which may be a
good caveat to him to look to his orders, lest otherwise he lose his
Rectorship, and perhaps a better thing besides:) there is no question to be
made of it, but that some close statute and prouiso was closely made, and
covertly foisted in for enabling some bastards in the spitefulle^ sense, to be
capable of any honor or dignity, either in the Church or Common wealth. And
true it is, that this good Fa. Parsons (altas Cowbacke) filius populi and
filius peccati, or the very fiend him self might be chosen to a kingdom by
his doctrine, if any people would be so mad as to choose him for their king:
because the said fury can translate himself into an Angel of light for an
hours space, though he turn into his hellish ugly shape within a minute of an
hour after, etc.

Happy were some men, if they might have a sight of that statute book or huge
volume of the high council of reformation for England; no doubt but he should
find notable stuff in it, that would serve for many purposes. But here I make
an end, concluding out of the premises. 1. That the Jesuits would take it in
scorn to have any poor secular or Seminary Priest compared with them in
prudence and policy: considering that they dare beard the greatest and
highest persons on earth in all things. 2. That in general England for this
age were able to set Nicke Machiauell to school; either in a good or a bad
sense of policy. 3. Yet taking Politia as S. Thomas and Divines do, for a
chief branch of prudence, with relation to government of a body political or
common wealth civil, there are that excel, both Machiauell and the Jesuits:
their politia being but an extrauagant or apocriphall virtue at the uttermost.
4. But take it as a she, crafty, dissembling wiliness, with a relation to
Atheism or a non religion; and then and therein the Jesuits do far pass
Machiauell, and I verily think any whomsoever of and in this age.

THE III. ARTICLE.
Whether then (if this kind of Jesuitical policy tend to Atheism) may a
man be possibly an unspotted Catholic by external profession and outward show
of life, and yet be proved to be an Atheist in action practice, and manner of
proceeding in the same external show and profession that he makes?

THE ANSWER.
HE may be so: for a right Machiuilean whom commonly in that sense we call an
Atheist, must be a counterfeit of all religions, professions, sects, A
Preacher, an Heralt of arms: and an Alchumist must be universal me^ fit o
discourse of any thing: the first by application of his speech agreeing to the
quality of the person, for one kind of document is for Princes: an other for
stude^ts: another for pesants, etc. and so in the difference of coats and
confections of quintessences: and the like is of an Atheist in another kind,
scil. in counterfeiting of actions, etc.
opinions, factions, and affairs, he must be one of those three sorts of
persons, that ought to be seen thoroughly, and not superficially in all arts
and sciences. He must be a Cateline in countenance, a Protheus in shape, and a
Camelion in change: gaudere cum gaudentibus, flere cum flentibus, and semper
vultum gestare in manibus, to chide and cherish, to wink and look, to laugh
and weep with a breath. He must be a precise Pithagoras, a sage Solon: a
magnificall Mecaenas, and a wanton Thraso, all at once. He must be a legifer
with Licurgus, a martial man with Hector, and a Councellor with Cicero. He must
be an Antiquary with Nestor: an Historian with Plutarch, and a Sapient with
Cato. He must be a Dauus in crafty slinesse, a Pigmaleon in fond affections,
and an Ulysses in courtly pleasance: to cast his eye here and there: his head
up and down, and use his voice high or low at his pleasure. In few, he must
comply with all times, comport all persons and be full of complements in all
things pertaining to motion, in iesture and behavior, speech, silence or any
action. So as a perfect Atheist must be either a complete Alchumist, or an
upright humorist, but always an hypocrite.

THE IIII. ARTICLE.
Whether all the Jesuits may in the sense precedent in the last Article be
rightly called Atheists or not, and wherein their fallacy does most consist? An
od conceit I have of the Jesuits perfection and excellency, moves me to place
the General loco summi generis as a Summist of all the rest subordinate under
his fatherhood. For their society being subject to no superior authority
otherwise the^ as they please and yet authorized of their own bare word, to
check control, and correct, al and who^ they are displeased withal, sparing
neither king Kesar, Pope nor Priest, their head must needs be a primum or
supremum genus, as not subordinate to or under any earthly power: nor yet
subject to any law


THE ANSWER.
TO say the Jesuits are all smattred with Atheism, I will not: and to say,
that any of them all are absolutely scotfree from it, I cannot: it is so
repugnant from their own principles. Therefore must we needs use a
distinction betwixt a Jesuit commandant, and a Jesuit obeisant. A Jesuit
commandant I take in this place to be one of these three universals or
predicables. scil. father General, father Provincial, father Rector: the
first as a summum genus of the society, commands all in all nations: the second
as a species commands those of that kingdom, nation and province where he
lives: and the third loco differentiae, like the Lord Mayor of London, or
governor of this or that Town or City, does command with a different
authority all those that live under him there. And a Jesuit obeisant may be
divided into the other two Pophytian universals, called proprium and accidens,
with the addition of omni soli semper and vbique to the former: and separable
and inseparable to the latter. For all inferior Jesuits must obey their
superior fathers: they only must acknowledge their obedience to a sole
Jesuit, and none other Prince, Potentate, or Prelate whosoever: their obedience
must last for ever, at no time free, for what cause soever: and it must be
every where without exception of person or place: so as if they be commanded
to call the Pope his holiness Lutherane, they must do it, and so they have: if
to murder an anointed Prince, they must do their endeavor and none has been
wanting: and if in court or country, Church or Palace, the field of war or
land of peace, and that in a Heathen, Heretical, Schismatic or Catholic
country, all is one they must obey it. And this is proprium quarto modo, as
agreeing to none other order, society, association, company or corporation
whatsoever, save only the Jesuits. A sword is inanimate, and but a dead piece
of metal, and yet it is the death of a quick life leading man. A cause
isntrumental is the immediate agent in every action artificial and the
principal agent natural, is but therein a cause remote. Take then away the
instrument, and the artificer is able to do nothing: and move the isntrumental
Jesuits, and their fantor^ isntrumental to forsake the Jesuitical Principles,
and then will not. Fa. Parsons be able to do any thing: which being so,
therefore stands it their Prouincials, Fa. Garnet and Weston upon all they are
worth to bestirre themselves to lie, to face, to forge, to deny, to forswear,
to renounce, to praise, to extol, to admite, to defame, to despise, to count
light, and to do all that the devil can suggest, or wit can devise, to advance
themselves and overthrow the seculars, else are they no Atheists nor current
Politikes: sed vtri credendum sit censetu: whethe: seculars or Jesuits are
herein to be obeyed.
Again it is rightly called accidens as well separabile as inseparabile: for as
it comes by chance, and falls out by hap-hazard, that any one is a Jesuit:
so being once admitted, confirmed and professed in the society (which few are,
such is their policy to keep them in awe, and themselves out of fear of
revealing their chief secrets, which only the professed fathers are
acquainted withal in chief, until they be thoroughly tried, by many years
continuance) the graces granted, and rules prescribed them being both inherent
to their order: it is an inseparable accident unto them to be such, and none
other ever after: for otherwise there were no reason of their freedom, more
from impossibility of error, then others have. And yet because free will
bewraies their folly, launching out right Libertine-like perforce: hereupon it
comes, that popular applause, puffing them up with proud conceits of their own
proper excellency: finding that they have as good parts, gifts, and abilities
as their superiors (be he Rector, Provincial or General) greedily affecting
sovereignty with their fellows (a quotidian hot ague naturally burning in all
ambitious hearts) and either being inwardly too scrupulous, or outwardly too
lavish after many and perhaps long conflicts with themselves: they break out
and renounce the society: some afterward becoming very holy, virtuous and
religious persons in another kind: and others given over to such liberty, as
(the observation had by them of their superiors behavior, and other rules and
principles, partly insinuated and taught them, partly collected by necessary
sequeles, and conferring of things together by them) they fall quite away out
of Gods Church, and become Apostataes from their faith, their vow, their
obedience and all things: and so make the former inseparable accident to become
separable, and quite separated from them.

Of this kind then of the Jesuits obeysants (to leave the former commandants to
purge their Politiques from Atheism) I can say none otherwise, then as of
inferior subjects, petite captains, forragers, purueyors, and common
soldiers: to wit: that though such be bound to obey their Sovereign, the
General of the field, or Emperor of the wars: yea perhaps sometimes in
battle unlawful, in attempts tyrannical, and unjust enterprises: which they
often neither knowing, neither suspecting, neither bound to enquire after, (for
Princes affairs are subjects secrets, and sacramentum regis reuelare, nefas
est) they may intend, act, and perform without offense under obedience, that
which in the commandant is most criminal, offensive and damnable: yet neither
does, neither can this excuse them in foro externo, and by the law of nature,
of nations and of arms, to be equally guilty as the other are: and being
taken in the wars or otherwise, by the opposite Prince or adversary, may be
proceeded against, as if they were the Generals, Coronels and Captains of
whole regiments, companies and bands: because they as instruments, and these as
principal agents intend the producing of one and the self same effect
precedent in these causes. And conformably hereunto: forasmuch as the General,
the Prouincials and the Rectors amongst the Jesuits are those in cuius virtute
caeteri operantur, although many of the inferior sort of Jesuits obeisants may
be, and I verily think are virtuous and good men of themselves, and so do
live, and may no doubt continue so to their lives end: yet by reason of this
subordination, and due obedience required in all inferiors to their
superiors, and all and every religious or secular order or society: as
Friars, and Monks, to their Abbots, Priors and Guardians: these again to their
Prouincials, and these to their General, of Benedictines, Dominicanes,
Franciscans, etc. Also in Cannons of Cathedrals to their Deane: Deanes,
Archdeacons, Parsons, Vicars and all the rest of the seculars and religious or
Ecclesiastical and Monastical order, to their Bishops: Bishops to their
Metropolitanes and Primates, etc. and all these again together with the Lords
and other Nobles, Gentles and meaner subjects subordinate one under another to
their Sovereign Lord, Prince and King, etc. It must needs follow, that there
is not a Jesuit in all England this day, but has a bitter smacke of Fa.
Parsons impiety, irreligiositie, treachery, treason and Machiuilean atheism.
And so by reason of their subordinate obedience, they are all tainted with that
foul vice, which consists of many Atheall principles, all reduced to two
monstrous heads: to wit, exaltation of them selves, and downcast of all that
side not with them. And like as the cutting off of whole bands of common
soldiers, The Jesuits have all the three helps of advancing the^ to a
Monarchy, scil. money by cousinage: men by false devises: and munition by
promise of kingdoms to great persons.
is a more security for the adverse party, then if but one captain were cut
off alone (these three matters, money, munition and multitude, being the
strength of all warfare, and only hope of conquest, victory and triumph:) and
again, as the increase and supply of such, is the only help and means of
repairing an annie casseered, or bringing a broken battle into ranks and
orders again: it must needs be a consequent of course that the Jesuits have no
small drift in collecting, conueying and hoording up so great and many sums of
money, in creeping in with so many great persons, and in flocking together here
in England as of late years they have, and daily do more and more increase. And
it cannot be otherwise, but that so long as there is one Jesuit left in
England, there will be mutinies, treasons, conspiracies, and factions, do what
Pope or Prince, or any other is able to do, or say to the contrary. Therefore
do I conclude, that their advancement being the ready downfall of all that
are not with them: there is not a Jesuit nor a Jesuits fautour any where to be
found, but has a foul taste of Atheism, either directly per se, or
indirectly, or virtute primi and principalis agentis. The experience whereof
half witted men may see in England and elsewhere: the chief objection in
request to make silly souls to dote on the^ being this: scil. Why? is not
such a Father a good man? I never heard him speak an evil word of any
creature, nor meddle in any state matter, or other worldly affair: but all
his speech tends to piety, virtuous life and mortification, etc. I say, if
any be so pure, as believe it that list, now that I have both heard so much
and seen so many letters of Fa. Gerrard to the contrary: (of whom of all the
rest I ever thought the best,) that Jesuit of all other does most hurt: as used
of purpose to win affections; and get great sums of money into his hands:
whereby the society is backed and strengthened, and the adverse party thereby
more weakened every way. And this reason was once alleged on the Lord Dacres
behalf, why none of his should in policy give any extraordinary countenance
to any Jesuit, knowing the chief was his Lordships mortal enemy: and
therefore the name of a friend to any inferior did increase the number of
enemies: all running one way for obedience.

WHether then, seeing it seems that the Jesuits work much by inferior
agents, employing those that are fit for nothing else, to win peoples hearts
unto them by gifts, bribes, plawsible persuasions, words of admiration, and
other means, in all things rare: may then any one man or other set forth
himself to the world or not, verbi gratia, in concealing such things as may
hinder his own advancement, as meannesse of birth, insufficiency of wit, want
of learning, wealth and other favors of fortune, or abilities, virtues and
graces, either attending on the body or mind, together with hiding such
defects as are private in himself, either of nature or otherwise accidental.
And if he may, then whether to the prejudice of any other or not, either in
general or inspeciall?

THE ANSWER.
NO question but he may do so, either for a public or for a private good, so
it be without prejudice of others thereby: yet neither may all persons do so
alike, nor those that may; yet not at all times alike, nor in all places
equally without difference. For the better understanding whereof, it is to be
noted, that those who have quite abandoned the world, ought not to seek
aduancements in the world, and by consequent not to set forth themselves
otherwise then they are indeed. Neither in truth shall you find it in any
religious order or person, (unless they be apostataed from their faith, as is
ordinary by that occasion taken,) save only amongst the Jesuits, with whom it
is as common a practice as to say their Breuiary. See a notable stratageme for
this matter in the next Article, how Doctor Worthington president at Dowry, and
father Ho^t the fully states man at Bruxels bestirred themselves in procuring
boys and girls, and ^ll sorts of p^rs^^ to m^ke p^^t^on to the king of (...)
and other Princes, to have f^^her Parsons made Lord Cardinal of England,
m^king it seem otherwise, that all religion and hope of the king Catholics
aduanceme^t to the English Crown, would ^uaile and be dashed for ever: and yet
(forsooth) these holy fathers may not seek for any ^^^^nceme^t: neither will,
neither may they take it being thrust upon them. So the fox will eat no
grapes, not hungry hou^ds any du^ty pu^dings, unless they can come by the^,
and not be seen.
And I verily think more common in some of them, whose whole study,
meditation and endeavor seems as it were to tend to this only end, how to
advance them selves and their society. Which mind of theirs, for that it
suffers a contradiction by reason of their religious profession and vow of
voluntary poverty (containing in it many particulars opposite to all or any
either ecclesiastical or temporal advancement) therefore must they set all
their wits a wool-gathering, making choice of the finest locks to work up this
web in so smooth a loome; and that so covertly, and the threeds so laid and
wrought in, close couched together, as not a break, knot, or any the least
tuft or end of a thread, extrauagant of any mundane thought or secular
advancement fished for by them be left to be seen: but all pure zeal,
spiritual contemplation, perfect mortification, Christian renunciation,
contempt of honor, riches and all worldly esteem. Of this I need to say no
more, every Quodlibet and Article ministering occasion to talk of the Jesuits
ambition, incrochment, and seeking for advancement by concealing such defects
and wants in themselves as are very necessary to be known, and no way ought
to be kept close: neither will they be so hereafter, unless they mend their
manners, and reform themselves in their order. Now for others that live in the
world abroad in way of advancement, to and in a state ecclesiastical or
temporal, thus stands the case. I told you before in the Quodlibets of Fame
and report what a Priests place and office was, and how the state
Ecclesiastical or secular was ever to be preferred before the Monastical or
religious Monos tying them to a solitary life, and Religion to a stricter
retired course and order. Therefore true it is, that though both Priests and
lay persons may lawfully seek for aduanceme^t, as hereafter shall be showed,
Quia qui in Episcopatum desiderat bonu^ opus desiderat, said the choice vessel
of divine election, to his scholar and disciple consecrated Bishop per
impositione^ manum suarum: yet is there a great difference in the matters to be
revealed or co^cealed, for the better furtherance or hinderance of their
advancement, verbi gratia, a man given over either to wine or women, is not to
take upon him the charge of souls: but being initiated to holy orders, a close
Cell is fittest for him, to avoid both the danger of damning his own soul by
fact, scandal and lewd example given, and also the ruin and fall of others,
by his conuersing with them: Qui enim tangit picem coinquinabitur, and qui amat
periculum, periculo peribit. And thererefore ought he secretly to impart the
conflicts he has with himself in such a case to his ghostly father, with
desire to have him work some convenient means to stop his preferment if he be
urged to take curam animarum upon him. Otherwise, if needs he must take
charge, then let him ever have just Job his league written in his heart, Pepegi
foedus cum oculis meis ne cogitarem quidem de virgin, and so concealing his
own infirmities, obstando principijs as much as is possible ter dominu^
rogando (yea ter centies with S. Paul vt auferratur a se stimulus carnis
angelus Sathanae qui illum colophizat: let him not double, but to beat in his
heart or feel in his flesh that comfortable answer which the said Apostle had
made unto him in the like case, Sufficit tibi gratiae meae, nam virtus in
insirmitate perficitur. And so let him go forward in the name of God and
reveal his defects to God alone. But now on the contrary in a temporal man,
these defects are not so great a blemish, because the one may easily be
remedied by marriage (a sacrament instituted in remedium peccati post lapsum
Adami:) and the other as sufficiently supplied by competent diet: and neither
the one or the other so dangerous to the Church, weal public, or the
infected therewith, as they are in the former. Again in a temporal man these
are greater defects and causes of hinderance to his preferment, then in a
Priest, scil. meannesse of birth, want of wealth, deformity of body, foul
diseases, and the like. For that although all these things are to be respected
in a Priest, scil. that he be not base borne, nor a bondslaue, nor a beggars
brat, nor a deformed creature, nor infected with any filthy disease, etc. but
on the contrary, of honest parentage, a free borne Denison, of sufficient
patrimony or means to live, though he were not Priest, of comely personage,
and of a clean constitution of body, and optima quaeque Deo: and further
although the question betwixt Ciuilians and Divines be pro and contra, It was
well asked when Adam delued, and Eve span who was then a Gentleman, insinuating
thereby, that all Nobleness and gentry came at the first but of mean persons,
compared in manners and order of life, with their successors or posterity. Yea
the greatest Emperor, honor and families in the world, came often up of
meanest officers in their progenitors, scil. of bondslaues, of Scriueners, of
Gardiners, etc. which is the cause, that whereas all honor and gentry rises
from one of these two heads, scil. from learning or from chivalry: that by
consequent, a Gentleman of proper merit by either, may and is to be preferred
before him of blood coat armor perfect, and ancestry, if his deserts excel the
others, otherwise not, etc.
concerning dispensations, legitimations, and enabling of such irregulates and
defectiues to advancement in the Church and common wealth, whereof somewhat I
spoke in the foresaid Quodlibet of Fame and Report, and more at large have set
it out in the Antiperistasis to Dolemans succession, in the bar of bastardie:
yet forasmuch as honor est in honorante say Deuines, in exposition of the
princely Prophets speech, Omnis honor regis ab intus in fimbrijs aureis, etc.

And for that the question is not of admittance into the number of nobles, or
ge^tles, but being once matriculated, cataloguated and registered in that
Kale^der, whether that then being but a Gentleman of proper merit only, and
not of blood, coat-armor, or auncestrie, the foresaid wants and defects do more
disable the subject, wherein they are inherent to advancement ecclesiastical
or civil; that is, whether a Priest by function, or an Esquire by creation
ought more to conceal and hide his faults, and which of them may be soonest
hindered from preferment to higher dignities: as from an ordinary Priest, to be
a Pastor, Vicar, Deane, Archdeacon, Bishop, etc. and from a Gentleman of
coat-armor, to be a Knight, Baron, Lord baron, Vicount and Earl, etc. Wherein
because it is presupposed, that they are both in the way to preferment: the one
as a consecrated Priest by his spiritual, the other as a created Esquire by his
temporal gentry: the difference by consequent must needs follow thereupon to
be this: that being once admitted by dispensation, legitimation, etc. those
things most in request with a Priest afterward must be learning, virtue,
government, etc. None of which (in our speech of means to advancement) are so
exactly required in a temporal Gentleman: and on the other side the graces,
and abilities expected at a temporal man's hand, must be parentage, valor,
comeliness of person, and wealth sufficient to maintain his estate, etc.
which may cause his good fortune by marryage and otherwise: none of which are
required so precisely in a Priest: and perhaps not at all necessities, his
preferment standing not upon marriage or ostentation of his wealth, friends and
temporal abilities, but upon the managing of the thing he has, or is to take
in hand, wherein wisdom, prudence and other civil, political, and moral
virtues are required. And so by consequent it follows, that as both are to
maintain their honor, renown and credit to the uttermost, so both may
conceal such defects as may hinder the same preferment, which otherwise might
and would accrue unto them, always respecting time, place, person and other
circumstances, as may prejudice either one or other thereby, which to explane
how that may happen, I will set the case down in these few examples following.

Saint Augustine (rightly called the Apostle of England) because sent hither by
blessed Saint Gregory the Great, to convert as he did this country to the
Catholic Roman faith) sending for the Welsh or Briton Priests fallen into
Apostacy and Pesagianisme to come to conference with him concerning sundry of
their heresies and gross errors, observing well his actions and behavior
toward them, upon the speech of a false prophet or Pelagian Hermit, they all
that came to parlee, presently left him before the first encounter: because he
did not rise and give them the chair, place, or honor point at their meetings,
mightily condemning him for an arrogant proud man. But yet was it no pride in
him at all, because he both came in all humble wise, submitting himself to the
meanest in all Kent, until he had converted them: and also for that he should
by giving them place, coming as he did an Apostle, have prejudiced the Sea
Apostolic, and the Popes Holiness: from whence as an ambassador with
Legatiue power he came: and also he should therein have prejudiced the Regal
Majesty of King Ethelbert of Kent by name: who then having received the
Catholic Roman faith at Saint Augustines hands (whom for that cause his
Majesty had highly privileged) they did not send for him, but he sent for
them by authority from the said King, who afterward also compelled them to
receive the same faith, and to renounce their heresy, with the death of two
thousand Monks of Bangor Abbey at one time, procured by the King of Kents
exciting the King of Northumberland and others to war upon them, etc.

Conformable to this example in another kind, may very well be the secular and
Seminary Priests coming into England, with like Apostolical authority, as
did Saint Augustine: and therefore as they are to humble themselves in all
respects wheresoever they come in England (as he did in Kent) under any civil
magistrate under her Majesty, and not to contend for a cappe, or a knee: where
is ready prepared for them a rack, and a halter, by course of law in this
land through the Jesuits mischievous practices, bringing all the rest to be
had in jealousy thereby: so are and ought they to stand upon points, when they
come in place, where their priesthood is called in question, A^^^e (...) with
(...) we^l ^e two ^^^^ble ^^^^^^es of (...) N^ (...) bo^^ h^^^^^d a^ ^b^^h
(...) ^^all men. The (...) was a^ ^o^re, shew^^ by the Lord ^^d. D^cre ^o Capt.
Stuke^^y: which Stuke^^y tak ng upon him to be ^n extraordinary g^^a^ person,
desire^ ^he ^^^le Dacre is (...) on a time, to g^ue him countenance and the
place of (...), where e^^^ h^ sta^^^ (...) checks (...) it, told hi^, ^o^ and
further, if he once este^ed to take either place or titl^ of honor upon him in
his pres^nce, he would ma^^ him know him self, as too ^reat ^n indignity (...)
so highly ^^scen^ed of that honor he was of, (...) h^ and blood to be suffered:
and that be should well know, that honor consisted not in popular applause,
nor yet (...) excess and fur^^it of worldly ^ches. The other example was of a
Noble man's son, who being prisoner to a Knight, f^r that the said Knight had
en^red, into some ^^ai^^ with (...) concerning hi^ Noble blood, be took him by
the slee^e, as they were in go^^g over a style, and passing over before him,
said. Know you Sir H.B. I am W. son of W Lo. S. and though I gave you place
before, yet hereafter I will not, neither can I without prejudice of my house
and honor do it, etc.
and used with contempt either of their function or of the Sea Apostolic, by
whose authority they plead. Marry yet herein also with a different respect
had to an adversary of an other profession and religion (whom in these times
to contend withal it were in vain, and but an occasion of more dangers, many
blasphemies and greater sins:) and to one that is of the same religion the
secular Priest is of. A very fit example agreeing whereunto was of late showed
by one secular Priest to three sundry persons all Catholics, and one a Priest
Iesuited: to the first being a Gentleman, but yet meaner of calling then either
of the other, he gave place at table hand, wall and style: because he saw it
proceeded of simplicity, inciuili l^ and rudeness in him (though perhaps
entermingled with some spice of s^l^ conceit and sauciness) and withal there
came no contempt of Priesthood dire^tly thereby. The second having also before
time always given place, because he was an intending person, and one that
thought himself no small fool, being able to dispend 800. pounds by year;
the said secular Priest on a time reasoning with him about these matters in
contention betwixt the Seculars and the Jesuits, and perceiving his
Jesuitical contempt of Priesthood, took him by the sleeue as they were going
to diner (in a Catholic company where he was sure) and thrust him back,
sitting down before him, telling him in plain, the case was altered: and that
though he had winked at his arrogancy before, yet now he must for the honor
of Priesthood make him know duty, and give place to his better, etc. To the
third, understanding that he had bosted much of his gentilitie and noble
alliance, and that therefore he was to be preferred before any other secular
Priest that was not a Gentleman of equal calling with him, they iumping just
together upon a time at diner, he put him back, and after the table was
drawn taking him aside, he said: Sir, I understand you boast much of your
gentilitie, preferring it before your Priesthood, to the great dishonor of
your function: It is a foul bird defiles his own nest: a base minded,
ignorant and unworthy Priest that knows not whether he takes his place
accordingly or no to his dignity and calling: and as worthy to have the skin
razed, cut off, and fleyed both from head and hand, and so degraded, as an
abuser of nobleness and gentry deserves to have his colors reuersed, his
arms pulled down, and his coat pulled over his ears and so degentred for ever
after. Know you therefore first that it is no note of pride in a gentlewoman of
Royal blood married to one of Noble, to take place of her Lady mother in law,
or her own mother in some case, if matched with one of honor borne, and
highlier descended then her parents are. Secondly this is the difference
betwixt spiritual and temporal Gentry, that the former by Priesthood is
charactered in the soul, and therefore may it be profaned, and the party
disgraced, the stamp can never be taken away: whereas the latter may not only
be profaned, but as clearly taken away, as if he had never been. These two
speeches going current, scil. that a Duke being proved a traitor is made but a
yeoman, and scarce so substantial a man: but a Priest though an Apostata, yet
can never be vnpriested again. Whereupon it comes to pass, that as worship
yields, where honor comes in place, and therefore a Noblemans son being
dubbed Knight, rather loses his place, and diminishes or obscureth his
honor then any way increases it, unless it be by name to his wife, by making
her a Madame of a Mistress: so gentry is augmented, where priesthood is
charactered: and therefore a diminution of honor to insert gently, as an
argument of a priestly title, or ecclesiastical dignity. Thirdly then and
last of all it follows hereupon, As Priest amongst Priests take their place
agreeing to their senioritie of priesthood: so nobles amongst nobles, and
gentles amongst gentles, according to their senioritie of creation: yet as we
see it often happens, that some gentles by their audacity, others by reason of
some great friend, or affied potentate in Court or elsewhere: others by their
wits being of quicker spirits, and withal having many better parts in them for
to win favor and merit the place of advancement, then other seniors of
their degree and calling* and others merely for their wealth and present
employment, being otherwise far inferior, etc. so the like does happen often
amongst Priests upon the same occasions, which sometimes may be tolerable and
sometimes not.
that Priests amongst Priests take their place according to the senioritie of
their Priesthood, (unless either by office, Doctorship, or some singular other
endowment attending on their function it be otherwise allowed of and given unto
them) clearly abstracted from all respects had to their generous blood
therein. And some move a doubt, whether a Noble man's son coming to be
priested, have any prerogative given above other Priests by reason of his
Nobleness: and questionless if he be a Monk, Friar, Jesuit, or other
religious person, he loses the place and title of his former honor, as dead
to all such titles accidental, as whose proper essence is not inherent in the
soul. But if he be a secular Priest, then it seems he keeps his place of
honor still, because as I told you in part before in the forenamed Quodlibet
of Fame and Report, an absolute Priest by the laws Canon and Civil is a
Knights fellow in place taking, but not above: and by consequent as a Noble
man's son takes place of an ordinary Knight that is not equally Noble as well
as he: so does he also of a Priest, etc. But now whether in place taking it be
a diminution of his Honor to be priested or not: there may be a question: and
I say it is not, by reason of the person whom he represents, which is the
Divine Majesty of God, his Omnipotent maker and most merciful Redeemer. For
like as Moses by the Leuiticall law, appointed an order amongst the
Aaronicall Priests, that they should be in degrees one above another, until
they came ad summum Pontificem: which he did as well to avoid confusion amongst
themselves, if all were equal, as they were for two thousand years space and
more (during the law of nature, the first borne of every family being always
a Priest, Lord and King, or Sovereign over the rest of his family and
kindred,) as also to prefigurate the like order now kept throughout the
Christian world, unless it be among the obseruants of the Puritanes and
Jesuits platform and principles: yet still stood this sentence true,
pronounced by the Prophet Joel, many hundred years after Moses gave the law,
that Labia sacerdotis custodiunt sapientiam and legem requires ex ore illius,
quia Angelus Domini exercituu^ est: (making every Priest a Legifer and King,
and by consequent a Kings fellow and Princes equal, in prescribing of laws by
the authority of the laws of God, of nature, and of nations.) So although in
the new law, or law of Christ and us Christians, the Melchisedicanian
priesthood be subordinate in divided orders one above another, even vsque ad
summum po^tificem, and before and since for avoiding of confusion in place
taking and other respects, the laws Canon, Civil and Municipiall or common of
this land have assigned to Priests their places in order as before is said: yet
for that they represent the person of Christ by the merits of his death and
passion, in a higher degree of perfection, aproximation and worthiness, then
any of either the old Moysaicall law, or yet of the new innouate Jesuitical
familians, although for order sake in civil conversation they keep a decorum
in place, with a correspondence betwixt the States Ecclesiastical and
temporal, as a Subdeacon before a Gentleman, a Deacon before an Esquire, a
Priest before a Baronet, a Priest and preacher, If every Priest should take
place agreeing to their Vice-gerencie under Christ, there could be no order
kept, all being of equal power in respect of Priesthood: therefore was it well
provided by the laws, and proceeded of institution divine, as may appear by
our Saviors giving of pre-eminence to Saint Peter above the rest of the
Apostles, that were as well as he all equally Priests, that the power of
jurisdiction should be a note to take their place by, as well amongst themselves
as amongst others abroad in the world.
or Doctor of Divinity before a Knight, etc. And finally, although in regard
of the same order, a Nobleman or his son take place of all these: yet always
Ioels sentence stands inuiolate, ratified, confirmed, and augmented with many
sacred, sanctions, privileges, and prerogatives due to the priesthood now,
which were not so before: in regard whereof the highest honor temporal on
earth is no whit dishonored, but rather has an augment of honor by his
Priesthood: which to confirm, that holy Bishop Saint Ambrose was bold (being
moved by the Emperor and in his princely presence to drink to the best man at
the table) to take the cup with a wassall to his Deacon, saying: all peace,
health, honor and happiness to you my Lord Emperor: your Majesty knows
that a Priest represents the person of Christ, and his Deacon supplies the
place of an Angel: and seeing the lowest Angel in heaven is far to be
preferred before the highest dignity on earth, pardon my dread Sovereign, if
I have done your Highness command, and preferred my poor Deacon in the cup
before the Imperial Regalitie of Caesar. Yea what else but only this does it
mean, that the poorest Priest on earth, if admitted to hear the Popes,
Emperors, or any other King or Prince his confession, sits covered in his
chair, while the other kneeles bare headed at his foot, to receive absolution
at his hands. But enough of this matter.

THE VI. ARTICLE.
WHether may or ought a man to seek the like praise, preferment, or
advancement for another of his society or company, equally as for himself: or
whether fitter in policy, if he seek it for himself or his special friends
to do it per se, vel per aliam, scil. quartam vel tertiam personam, etc.

THE ANSWER.
IN matters wherein there is some difficulty, danger, loss, reproach, or
shamefastness, a man may, and a true friend will often attempt, act, and
perform that for his friend which he would never dream of nor wish to
himself: and then by consequent it is clear, that a man may do equally and as
much for another as for himself, in the case proposed in the former article.
And a simple politician is he that will do it either immediately for himself or
his friend. For always the farther off it is contrived by a fourth, fifth or
tenth person, and that a thousand miles a sunder: the more cleanely politically
Machiuilean-like co^ueied it is. An example whereof that ignoble Polipragmon
father Parsons (though to the condemnation of his Atheall proud aspires, yet to
the high commends of his natural ingeny) may be to all posterity in his
practice for a Cardinals hat. The device for which was as follows.

After many practices of father Parsons and his fellows, against her Majesty
and the English Crown, Kingdom and State (whereof we will speak anon)
as well by his agents in England it self, as also in Italy, Spain and
Flanders, finding the secular Priests at Rome and in England always opposite
to his wretched designements, most unnatural attempts, and treasonable
practices, Cardinal Allane being now dead, and Doctor Worthington homo
secundum cor Parsoni, ruling all the roast in the Low Countries amongst the
Seminaries: as that covertly sullen surly Prelate father Holt, did amongst the
soldiers and other pensioners there: having devised many shifts for father
Parsons advancement, and all failing, at length the King of Spain was made
acquainted therewith, and how that the students and others of our nation, were
bent against the fathers for his sake (forsooth) in that they sought the
establishing of the English Crown to his royal issue, whereupon his Majesty
wrote earnestly to his Holiness Pope Clement that now is, A very ^^k^^ let to
this is their now proceedings here in England, to get bows and gi^les, vagrant
fellows, and such as ^ee by these scol^^^ and ^^ilings against seculars, (...)
it every (...) what a part wa^ it for the (...) to write (...) ^^^terly against
such blessed men as the Jesuits are, wh^ ^only uphold religion amongst ^s he
(...) England, wh^^h otherwise (...) ^qua^le, etc.
and to other Cardinals, that in any case they should support, bear out, and
mainaine the credit of the Jesuits, against the complaints of the English: who
without all cause, reason, and sense, but by being seduced by the Queen of
England, did greatly calumniate these holy fathers that sought their countries
good and happiness, as he affirmed.

Whiles this was a hammering in drawing the kings affection from all the
English and seculars to the Jesuits in general: the above named agents like
gallant states men father Holt and Doctor Worthington drew a very formal
letter, petitionall or supplicatiue, in the names of all the common soldiers,
laborers, artizens and pentioners, as well men as women equally without
difference, yea the yery scullians, landresses and servants were not omitted in
that pitiful complaining, showing to his Majesty the king of Spain, the
present calamities that England stood in: most humbly beseeching his Catholic
Majesty, in regard of the great affection and care of our country, and the
afflicted English, he would vouchsafe to deal most earnestly with the Pope to
prefer that unworthy, dishonorable Prelate father Parsons, to the dignity of
Cardinal: affirming it to be the only way to bind and unite the English to his
Majesty. (Miranda canunt sed non crede^da portae.) But what was the issue (nunc
spectatum admissi risum teneatis amice?) In expectation of the same preferment,
and for what causes else is to himself best known, and are not much material:
this good father went to Rome on pilgrimage, (you may please to imagine out of
Spain very devoutly, or rather directly) in the year 1597. Where he no sooner
arrived, but presently he was visited or rather courted with two Cardinals at
his lodging, to wit Cardinal Baronius, and the other a Spaniard. This
extraordinary courtesy and honor done unto the poor man, gave present occasion
of some speech in the city, that out of all doubt father Parsons should be made
a Cardinal. But the conceit begun thus in Rome, ended there also with a merry
jest. For father Parsons being counseled by the Physicians to keep his
stomach warm, sent his brother for scarlet to make him a stomacher, who of
likelihood so soon as ever he heard the name of scarlet, he was possessed upon
the sudden with so affectionate an opinion of his brothers advancement, that
forgetting his intent to have only a stomacher, he procured two Merchants to
carry in a whole wagon laden with diverse pieces of scarlet, to his brothers
lodging for making of his Cardinals robes, giving it out by the way to all his
acquaintance both going and coming, that his brother forthwith should be made
a Cardinal.

When this surly father saw such packes of scarlet brought unto him, no marvel
though he greatly wondered at it: but finding his brothers error, he was in a
great chafe, and mightily confounded, as easily seeing what sport it would be
to those that should hear of it. Whereupon in all have he dismissed the said
Merchants, as secretly as he could out at a back door: howbeit it was so open
and notorious a jest, as it could not be concealed, but caused indeed many to
laugh at him. Amongst the rest one little favored of this good father hearing
of it, came to his lodging in merriment, to congratulate his new advancement.
But as soon as father Parsons knew the purpose of his coming: yea (quoth he)
does he know it: then will it be in England within this fortnight. And thus
much for seeking advancement.

THE VII. ARTICLE.
Whether then (if lawful to seek advancement) is it lawful to defame, or
cast out a detraction of any Catholic, that may by their opposition be an
hinderance to the others designements? And if it be lawful then what kind of
detraction in policy is fittest to be used?

THE ANSWER.
IN a matter of fact, if the unworthy be to be preferred, or his maliuolous
intent or insufficiency made known to be such, as by winking at him he will be
the overthrow of the Church or commonwealth, or of the head or some public
member or special parcel thereof: verbi gratia: of the Pope, Prince, chief
Prelate, or Magistrate, upon whose high prudence the government depends, or of
some special corporation, etc. then and in that case he may have a defamation
cast out of him, which yet is not properly to defame or detract him, but to
detect, discover and disclose his mischief and unworthiness: always
preferring bonum publicum before priuatum. The Jesuits beating the world in
hand, that they are the only men on whose Athlantike shoulders the whole frame
of the Church and common wealth depends: may easily upon so fantastical a
persuasion bring people to believe that it is so meritorious a work, to
detract, cast of, and pull down all that side not with them, as whosoever does
so arbitretur se obsequit^m prastare Deo. But although ignorant people (not
acquainted with cosinage, Atheism and villainy, that the wit of man or malice
of the devil can invent,) seem and be incredulous, as not possibly induced to
believe such horrible crimes as the Jesuits have committed: yet the wiser sort
knowing that those in a far higher degree of perfection and neerenesse to
God, then any Jesuit is in, have committed as foul^ and fearful offenses,
make no question of it but the like may be in them, and do judge all things
written by the seculars against them to be true, the rather for that the
Jesuits being not possibly able to clear themselves: have only these two
naked shifts, scil. the one to deny all as lies: the other to defame all as
calumnators that write so. And upon these two Atheall grounds to stop all
means of coming to trial before his Holiness, and in the mean space to
incense the people against the seculars, as those that have committed the
fowlest or me that ever was in writing of books against them. All which the
wiser sort do see it but an Atheall device to hide from the world their
abominable facts: as though it were a sin to make known a traitor, an
heretic, an apostata, an Atheist, a cosiner, a cutpurse, a theife, a
murderer, or a knave in grain, etc.
But if the case concern himself only, or his own sole corporation, company
or society, in opposition against another, either equal or superior to it:
then is it most odious in the sight of God so to do. And this is a right
Atheall Machiuilean device of the Jesuits, who pass all that ever yet were for
detraction, and taking away a man's good name: yea even when they have tormented
a man to death, yet have they most sly and cunning sleights, to make it seem
apparent they never did such a thing: and withal to make the party thus
crucified by them, yet still to be condemned of all the world as maledictus and
an injurious slanderer of them. Nay, which is admirable, they have gotten such
a hand over the ignorant multitude, as even these things which are written and
discovered of them to the saving health of many a soul, that otherwise would
be drowned in heresy, and sink in sin by following of them, besides their
preservation thereby from falling into the danger of the temporal sword, by
this tribe of traitors and conspirators: yet have they gained peoples hearts so
far as they will neither read nor hear of their own dangerous and damnable
state (if they hold on) whereunto they are brought by them. But on the contrary
cry out of all books, letters and speeches, that may tend to the discovery of
these men's never heard of more Atheall and great impiety. Which drift of theirs
is nothing else but a mere sorcery, charm, or enchantment, to cast poor
souls into some apoplexy, lethargy, or other drunken disease, or sweet poison
that may soonest work at their hearts (for the sweetest poison is a toade: and
therefore the speediest death) and lull them asleep, until they be past
recovery, and then rowsing them up, they so enchanted are like madmen, or such
as run to go hang, drown, kill, or burn themselves: as many have in the
froth of their fantastical, erroneous cursed zeal: who^ yet whosoever should
have sought to have saved, prevented, or persuaded to take a better course, and
to renounce the devil and all such false illusions, persuasions and
suggestions put into their heads by man, woman, or wicked spirit: they would
have been ready to have slowne in his face for it. And even so many otherwise
devout Catholics led away with a vain and erroneous conceit had of these new
Scribes, Pharisees and hypocrites the Jesuits: are brought into such a fools
paradise as it is probable, if some did see them sink down quick into hell,
they would be ready and entreat to go with them, imagining they were in
heaven, wheresoever a Jesuit were amongst them. Which is no less blasphemy
then to affirm visionem beatificam or beatitudine a presentia diuina
profluentem to be appropriated unto them. Neither need any to wonder hereat
(though no Catholic nor true Christian heart but may lament it) seeing of late
years that absurd pseudochrist Hacket had so many followers as this wretched
Polipragmon Parsons in his Philopator does affirm, that the vaunts those base
companions ( Hacket and his company) then made ( scil. of 100000. to be of
their mind in England) is very probable to be true: taking Puritanes,
Barrowists or Brownists, Familians, Anabaptists and Atheists all put together:
and knowing the Jesuits have a more plausible and deceitful means to deceive
poor souls then any of these: yea more colorable devises then the family of
Love: who at the first set out books as Catholikly written as any could be: so
as you should hardly have perceived any heresy, or any other villainy to have
lurked in them: until the very vpshot, Epilogue, or conclusion in the last
chapter, leaf or paragraffe, wherein my self once noted how cunningly they
dealt to delude the simple and ignorant, with a very like persuasion to this of
the Jesuits, scil. That all being bound to seek for perfection which
consisted in renunciation of property in any thing, but to have all common as
it was (say they) in the Apostles time, when every man and woman sold all that
ever they had, came and did cast down the money at the Apostles feet, and
lived in common together: none taking any thing of their own but as the
Apostles assigned them. So this state of perfection being (say the Familians)
quite extinct and gone out of the Christian world: we are those whom God has
illuminated to repair, restore, reduce, and make perfect the same again, etc.
And does not I pray you the Jesuits doctrine and vaunt of their perfection tend
to the same end, in as bad, if not a worse manner then the Familians? Read the
second Quodlibet of plots by doctrine, for your better instruction in this
matter. And so to return to the Atheall order in policy, observed by the
Jesuits in defamation and detraction of others for their own advantage.
Although they do it by sundry means: yet so many devises they have for making
their platform of advancement to a spiritual monarchy, strong and impregnable
(if it were possible) as when I have done with these ten Quodlibets which
contain as you see each one of them ten a piece, and every one of these ten
more (one with another, which amounts to a thousand) yet shall I be ready, and
perhaps put it in practice, to make up a new greater volume then this of so
many more: the very complementall and historiall sum of all plots, practices,
stratagemes, policies and devises that ever either art, wit or malice could
or has invented: being registered, refined, polished, and reduced into a
formal method by them. But to avoid prolixity so much as I may, and discover
them as they are: I will only take one principle or maxim of their
mischiefs, observed by them for this matter, as follows.

In the practice of detraction there is great skill to be used many ways: but
the chief points to be kept are these two, the one that the matter have some
show of probability in it self: verbi gratia as to excuse a modest, grave, and
sober man of drunkenness, who never tasted of any wine, sider or strong-beare
in all his life: the presumption must be this, (with witnesses of it:) to wit,
that he was seen twice or thrice go in or come out of a Tavern or Alehouse,
etc. so to accuse another (though as innocent as Joseph or Suzanna) of
fornication or adultery: the presumption must be that he found such two
together alone in a chamber, or other place of suspicion, etc. there being no
man nor woman living but may be thus calumniated and slaundered in whatsoever a
right Atheist lists. Then the second point is: that having a ground ab
exemplo to build upon, what kind of detraction he pleases, he must always
apply the infamy in just opposition to the true same and report: Of all other
sins detractation is holden of divines to be most dangerous because fame slieth
farthest, and would the b^ck^iter never so gladly make restitution, yet he can
n^^er possibly perform it, ne^ he^ in respect of the number to him unknown,
to whose ca^e, the slander is go (...) Neither y^^ in ^e pect of the matter it
self: the most part persuading themsel^es that some s^^h thing there (...)
more or less, though now it be (...) colored, (...) up ag^^^e. Therefore (...)
the Iesu^^ will be ^ble to ^^ke amends (...) ^^^^^g so (...) ^^d^ h^rs yet on
live: I leave it to their strict actions, where they shall find that animus non
detractandi will not (...) their t^^nes. But yet on the contrary, the seculars
having animum detectendi of them in their proper colors, (...) of justice to
make all men beware of them and their false doctrine, in this point of casting
out a slander, or de^^^^ing of any opposite to their wicked courses.
and be ever sure to defame a man most egregiously in that wherein, either he
knows himself most faulty and likely to be overthrown, or else whereby as
by an opposite vice to that special virtue, gift or grace noted in his
adversary, he only hops to overthrow or attaint his credit for ever. For it
being not more common then true: that there is no fire without some vapor or
smoke: no man condemned without some suspicion, nor any slander raised without
some occasion taken or given by one thing or other: so the party once thus
detracted, were he as innocent as Christ himself, yet should he never be able
to put it out of all men's heads, but that some would think it either was so,
or little otherwise, or something was amiss. Conformably hereunto if the party
be prudent, of a stirring wit, a quick spirit, and a working head, etc. give
out that he is but a fool, one that can keep no counsel: will for a fair
word tell all he knows, and has nothing in him but a blind Bayardlike
boldness, etc. and either learn out some oversight or other committed by him,
or else get some one or other to supplant him in the premises (which may
happily be done in some small trifling matter, with the wisest men in the
world) the common speech being most true aliquando dormitat Homerus) and then
let that oversight be a current of course in general terms: that he is b^t a
weak, silly, peevish, foolish, impudent body, and say: for example, why, did
he not do, or tell this or that? etc. If he be of a good carriage, government,
discretion, learning and judgment, etc. give out he is rash, unexperienced, of
no study, learning, nor quality, nor of any behavior to the purpose, etc. If
he be to enter into any office or government: cry whow! what he a Cardinal? a
Bishop? a President? a Doctor, etc. and laugh him or them (that report it, or
wish it) out of countenance for it. If he write any book or work of worth,
jest at it, scoff at it, find some special fault or other in it: as either
that he brings no proof but of his own surmize, or that his author was of no
reckning, or such a place, person, time or actio^, falsely alleged (which in
historical discourses, indeed sometimes may be amongst the soundest and surest
chroniclers that are, as all men know it) or this sentence without sense, or
this false and corrupt, or but a childish discourse without substance, method
or style in it: or but a plain dunce, doggrell, dottrel, or without any
phrase, but all in inkehorne terms, or written of spleen, malice and disdain,
and but an infamous libell: and so reject it as unworthy the answering, or yet
(and much rather) not worth the reading. If he be like to win or have won the
hearts and affections of some great persons: or stand in grace and favor, with
such as may countenance him out: let gifts walk to some night Crows, or other
vnfriends or back friends that may by bribes or other enticements be set on to
incense against him: as to be but a base fellow, a blab, one of no talent, nor
account, nor reckning in places where he has lived: a discredit to have him
in their house or about them: or to suffer him to be in their company, or have
any dealings with the^, or for them, etc. If he be framed by nature to be of a
good disposition, affable, and of a commendable and virtuous life: say he is
but a dissembler, ambicious arrogant, a spy, a counterfeit: an apostata: an
Atheist, etc. and be ever ready to cry whoreson first, in that vice whereof thy
self art guilty, and against that virtue which in the other may prejudice thy
purpose. And always be sure to have examples in readiness, be they never so
bald or impertinent to the purpose in their original: to confirm that which
is intended against him to be true: which to have plenty of in store: the
readiest course is: to harken out in every house, place and company, where such
as thou intendest to detract have lived: and as it is almost impossible but
that amongst the dearest friends that live on earth, there will sometimes be some
cross words, or light dislikes: so always to learn out where such are: and
if that will not make a breach, then for to cast out some thing or other of one
or both, whereby to make them fall out and part company: that all and more then
all, that the one knows by the other, may be known and so work upon it
accordingly as before. Amongst many experiences of the Jesuits malice in these
practices of detraction, I will here set you down only two examples: one
concerning my self, which I will be brief in here, because in the Apology for
mine own purgation, you shall hear of it more at large: and the other shall
be concerning the Students at Rome, wherein also I will be sparing, and take
nothing but for this purpose now in question, for casting out of a detraction,
and thus it was for both apart.

It is not unknown to all Catholics in England, how easy a matter it has
been since the Jesuits began their reign amongst us, for sundry lay persons
if never so little crossed in their intents and purposes: or if that he (who is
their gstostly father) will not applause unto them in every thing they do or
say; how that presently they will take pepper in the nose, with caeteri volunt,
and so utterly refuse him, and choose another ghostly father to their liking: or
at the Fathers or some fautors of theirs, appointment over them. And no where
sooner does this happen, then where these ghostly children are, that being
given to loose life, or other kind of wanton behauior or scandalous liberty,
will not leave off their lewd courses, nor endure to hear, or be advised,
ruled and persuaded by their ghostly fathers in things pertaining to their
souls behoof. Whereof I having tried many rufull experiences: one amongst the
rest was about a Letter sent unto me by a special friend concerning an
Honorable person very notoriously defamed. Who having been my ghostly child,
it was objected against me by my adversaries (some of the Iesuitical faction,)
that I knew of such lewdness and winked at it, etc. This rumor although I
straight imagined it was but a device to make the parties and me fall in
dislike at least one of the other: yet could I do no less then signify by
letter so much unto the party on that behalf, and for mine own discharge
wrote somewhat sharply, and yet in all charitable manner to avoid such company,
etc. But how it proved the effects showed. One of the Jesuits faction got
presently an interest there in that party: and I was persecuted, made odious
to some of my friends, and threatened (of a carpet Cales knight) to be killed if
ever he could meet with me: yet anima mea in manibus meis, it was the least
thing I feared. Another like to this was shortly after about one of no less
Honorable calling: of whom having heard and seen such dealings as neither
with a clear conscience could I any longer wink at as the case stood,
neither could I find any hope or likelihood of continuance there, after the
ye were once broken by reason of the heavy persecution I already sustained
by certain lay persons of the Jesuits faction, that most basely labored by
continual slanders, vile speeches, and most false reports to work me out
thence: having first gotten my stuff conveyed from the party in secret (as no
whit deceived in imagining what would follow) and then making a separation
betwixt him and his wench, causing her to go home to her parents: presently
hereupon there arose such a huffing perrie against me that I was forced to
betake me to my heels; and ever since have lived banished from the place and
company of those I ever dearly honored, regarded and affected. And these two
noble persons are now most earnest prosecutors of the Jesuits and Archpriests
sedition, falsehood and faction: notwithstanding that the latter has heretofore
often conceptis verbis most deeply detested them, with many vows, promises
and protestations, never to admit of any of them, yea or of any other, that
prejudice either our cause in general, or my self in special. Sed tempora
mutantur and nos mutamur in illis: yet to this day will no blustering speeches
nor big looks get that party a good name or credit, but to be a stale and
laughing stock to the Jesuits for some noble blood that is the best in the
said parties body. The reason whereof I could tell pardie, Sed transeant ista,
etc. Now to the detraction of the students at Rome: therein only a word or two
of father Parsons impiety in his letter dated at Naples the thirteenth of July
Anno 1598. to make the English students odious to all posterity, so much as in
this wretched caitiffe lies: affirming that such of the students as opposed
themselves against the fathers, were not well established in the grace of God,
when they came to Rome, or had no due preparation to the calling of Priesthod,
yea, he spares not our mother City, but impeacheth the credit of it most
egregiously: it being the seat of Christ his honor here on earth. His words
are these.

When I came to Rome (says he) I found the College as a field with two
hostile camps, within it father General and his assistants wholly auersed and
thoroughly resolved to leave the government, etc. And taking upon him to show
the causes of those long troubles in the College, he says: Some think that
it is in great part the nature of the place that ingendereth high spirits in
them that are not well established in Almighty Gods grace. For coming thither
very young, and finding themselves presently placed and provided for
abundantly, This speech had been fitly applied to father Parsons himself, and
may justly be returned upon him and his society.
and acquainted daily with sights and relations of Popes, Cardinals, and
Princes affairs, our youths that were bred up at home with much more
simplicity: and kept under by their parents and masters, more then the Italian
education does comport, forget easily themselves, and break out into liberty:
I mean such as have run astray and lost respect to their superiors in Rome.
And this opinion of the circumstance of place is greatly increased by the
judgment of strangers: both Spanish and French, Flemings and other nations:
who affirm that they try by experience, that their people which live in Rome,
if they be not men of great virtue, do prove more heady afterward and less
tractable then others brought up at home. But yet to this other men of our
nation add a second reason for the English College which is at Rome, being a
place whereunto many young men do resort, only upon a desire of seeing
novelties. When any come thither of the English nation, and find such a
commodity of study and maintenance and themselves in want and misery, they made
suite for that whereunto perhaps they had no true vocation from God, nor due
preparation in themselves, to so holy and high an estate: and so being once
admitted, fell afterward into disorder, and to put out of joint both
themselves and others, etc.

Thus far this impious father shows it to be the want of grace in some, and
want of true calling in others, that they disagreed with the Jesuits. But now
to hear his report of the estimation that our English students and Priests
have gotten by their being at Rome, I think it will make all parents afraid,
and all our youth abhor coming at Rome amongst them ever after, unless
their parents wish, or themselves intend to have them all Jesuits, or at least
Jesuits bondslaues, to swear to whatsoever they say, to trot and trudge
whither and when they please, and to run their most traitorous race and
cursed courses, inhumane, odious, hateful to God and man. In good faith (dear
Catholics, Lords, Ladies, Gentles, or whosoever you be that have your children
or other friends under the Jesuits tyrannical yoke in bondage beyond the seas:
pardon for Gods love, pardon my vehemency on your behalf, against these
malignant wretches.) I could not with patience set hand to paper, after I had
read this letter following, but walked two or three turns up and down in my
chamber, tre^bling in anger, with my heart as high as my head, to think on the
villainy of this bastardly runagate Parsons: (cursed be the hour wherein he was
borne, this filius peccati, sacrilegij, iniquitatis, populi, Diaboli) how ever
he durst come at Gods holy Altar, after his blasphemies, and outrageous
speeches, and writing against the secular Priests and Students, most falsely,
irreligiously, and Pharisaically laying his own sins, and the rest of the
Jesuits seditious vprores, and more then heathenish impiety upon the innocent
most cruelly persecuted by them all, and by him in special above all the rest,
as most cruel Jewish hearted unnatural. His words are these.

Lo this wretch: There is no true humility, obedience, nor other virtue, but
in a Jesuit or his bondslaue.
Baconius (says he, and that was one of the Cardinals that came comport him at
his lodging) often told me that our youths bragged much of their Martyrdom:
but they were refractarij (that was his word) had no part of Martyrs spirit
which was in humility and obedience. His Holiness oftentimes told me that he
was never so vexed with any nation in the world. For on the one side, they
pretended piety and zeal, and on the other, showed the very spirit of the
Devil in pride, All the world knows these things rightly to simbolize with
Parsons, and the rest of the Jesuits.
contumacie, and contradiction, etc. and ever now and then his Holiness would
put his finger up to his brain, signifying: that there stood their sickness:
and so would most of the Court, when they talked of them, saying: the English
were indiauoluti, and like words. His Holiness added also, that he knew not
what resolution to take: for on the one side, to punish them openly, would be a
scandal, by reason of the heretics: and if he should cast them forth of
Rome, some had told him that they would become heretics, etc. Lo what a long
loud lie this Puritan Jesuit has brought to a loose end, falsely fathered on
his Holiness against the seculars: all the world knowing the Jesuits to be the
men most like of any other in the world this day, to fall into the most
blasphemous heresy and apostacy: as these that are become already
incorrigible of any Prince, Prelate, or people. And again he says, that I
have heard his Holiness often, and diverse Cardinals more often report, with
exceeding dishonor to our nation, the headiness and obstinacy of our
youths. So as now many great and wise men begin to suspect, that the
sufferings of our blessed Martyrs and confessors in England, was not so much
for virtue and love to Gods cause, as of a certain choler, and obstinate will
to contradict the Magistrates there, etc.

O monster of all other (for so I may well term thee, because I imagine thou
art an irregulate Priest, by reason of thy aspiring heart, which probably would
never permit thee to seek for dispensatio^ of thy bastardly base blood! Sundry
mischievous practices of impiety are among the Jesuits: yet of all their
maxims, this is one of the most inhumane, bloody, cruel and merciless, to
wit: that whosoever does not approve and advance Fa. Parsons, and some of his
fellows conceits and courses touching our country and nation: (though they be
never so foolish, rash, furious, scandalous and dangerous: nay though men be
desirous to sit still, and meddle nothing with them nor against them one way or
other) yet if he do not aid and assist the^, yea and be currents of their
fatal course in all things it is lawful, yea, meritorious, to have such
persons infamed, by casting out any calumniation against them that may
discredit them: the practice whereof, how many poor Priests in England have
tasted? nay who has not? there being not one secular Priest, who^ less or
more they have not defamed: yea no Prince, Prelate, Lord, Lady, or other
person is free from the sting of their tongue, unless they be Iesuited.
) woe worth thee wretch: woe worth thee and all the Jesuitical brood: who to
maintain thy ambition, have brought this obloquie, reproach and discredit upon
our dear countriemen and brethren, innocent, harmless hearts, torn out
bleeding by thy massacring merciless cruelty. No law was made in this land
for shedding the guiltless blood of Priests, until thou and thy traitorous
race by your conspiracies, brought all into jealousy: thou in the mean space,
like a base dastardly coward (as commonly all traitors are) taking thee to thy
heels: and when any thing happened that might yield profit, praise or
esteem, tu and domus tua (the perturbers of Isreal's peace) arrogated it to
your selves: if any thing were discovered that might breed danger, you
attributed it to the Seminaries and other seculars: thou still reviving old
rebellions, and thereby causing new persecutions upon the seculars and other
Catholics, shrowding thy seditious practices under the wings of the innocent,
and thereby making our Prince and country odious to all nations, for shedding
so much guiltless blood: whiles the State knew not who were guilty and who
were free: and yet not content to have imbrewed thy irregular hands over
elbowes and all up to the shoulders in occasionating so much blood to be spilt,
to keep still in hope thy ambitious heart, have thou now opened thy profane
sacrilegious lips to bring all into jealousy and suspicion one of another: to
make both Pope and Prince, Martyr and Confessor, secular and temporal persons
odious to all the world: and to themselves most hateful, injurious and
contradictious. Has not all Europe talked of our English persecutions? And
have not thou and thine been causers of it here, and brochers of it abroad in
other nations to thy Prince and countries infamy? Have not all nations where
the English lived, honored the secular and Seminary Priests for their
innocence? have they not sought to have had their prayers, and desired them to
offer sacrifice for them, before those of their own nation? And do thou as a
Zoilus Timon, of an envious emulation at the reverend esteem had of them,
condemn them to be men of evil spirits? have not they lived in honor, grace,
and favor with Princes, Nobles, and people of all sorts where ever they came:
some stooping to kiss the ground where they went: others hurling forth
vollies of sighs at their departure, knowing they came like lambs with
innocent hearts amongst their dear countrymen and friends, made wolves,
tigers, and lions against them by thy means? which few of the innocent knew
of, and none of them grieved, ever dreamed of: so closely thou kepst the venime
in thy rankred heart? Have not sundry Popes much bewailed our countries
desolation, showed true Gregorian affections toward the English nation: often
entered into patheticall discourses of our youths, to see so fine, delicate and
dainty a breed of wits, come from under the North pole: and sometimes shed
fatherly tears in sending of them hither into the bloody shambles, which thy
railing libels and traitorous practices had prepared for them? both Pope,
Prince and Priest being abused, deluded, iniuried and unjustly condemned by
thee and thine? Have not all those that came malcontents thence, been such as
exposed themselves to thy Jesuitical pride, impiety and treachery? And do
thou now dare to say, their sufferance was of choler, and obstinate will to
contradict the Magistrate here? nay dare thou father this new hatched lie of
thine haughty brain upon his Holiness? for whose cause, and for our
obedience to the Sea Apostolic we chiefly, wholly, and only suffer, as
brought into jealousy here for our obedience that way by them? O wretched
seed of Caine and son of Belial! think not but thou shall one day reap the
shame of this report, and end thy days with ignominy and stain to thy
society, as the most impious detractor on earth that ever lived.

THE VIII. ARTICLE.
WHether upon the premises in the answer to the last Quodlibetical Article, may
it be inferred, that a man unfit to govern, or to be advanced, either for want
of learning, or for some other defect thought not to be so worthy as another
for that place: yet may be preferred before his better, or not: for some other
respect of fame, kindred, wealth, affection, etc. And if he may, then what is
chiefly to be required to make one that has nothing in him worth the speaking
of, to set out himself withal: yet to seem admirable to the mobile vulgus?

THE ANSWER.
RIches, honors, liberty, health, beauty, etc. are accidents attending on the
external man, which go not by signs and symptoms: but by chance and change
of fate or fortune, if any be, or may be termed so. Whereupon it comes (as
the Proverb goes current) that the greatest Clerks are not always the wisest
men: though oftentimes it be so. For it is a thing impossible for a fool ever
to be a profound Clerk, and never seen, but that he which is very learned
indeed, must necessarily have a very good wit withal, else could he never
attain to any great or extraordinary knowledge: and then by consequent,
learning and wisdom joined together in one subject, make that person more fit
for government, then where there is but one of these alone. Yet to speak
conformably in answer to the article: preferment at all times, in all places,
and to all offices, goes most by favor of the Prince or superior power: also
by procureme^t of friends (whereupon comes the saying, better to have a
friend in Court, then a penny in purse: also eminency of the person by birth,
blood, or otherwise amongst those where he lives: wealth also may do much (for
that will get friends every where) yea I dare boldly speak it, that the chief
friends the Jesuits have, and the greatest enterprises taken in hand by them;
is done more by bribes given to brokers (such as John Fulwood, N. Norwood,
George Cope, and other needy people, that know not how else to live, but by
being the trumpetters of their trumperies, and to be common criers for them,
going with oyesses up and down the streets on their behalf, to make them
famous and others odious:) I say they bring more treacherous practices to pass
by this, then by any other means. So that these external and accidental
favors, attending on the body, and not the indowments of the mind, or deserts
of the person, are often chief agents for aduancements. Now as for the means
to seem some body, and yet be no body indeed, that must come by brokers:
whereof (as I have said before) the Jesuits have plenty: no country, court, or
corner, being without such Locusts or Philistines, ready to come upon all men,
by spreading abroad what famous books, acts, etc. have past from the Jesuits,
their austerity of life, their humility, obedience, contempt of the world, and
a thousand lies besides.

THE IX. ARTICLE.
Whether the Jesuits use this as an ordinary kind of blazon for their
preferment or no: or whether it be in them lawful so to do, or else only a
Machiuilean slight and Atheall policy?

THE ANSWER.
WIthout all question it is a mere Atheall policy in their heads, as their
Prouincials, Rectors and others directly, and in their inferior substitutes it
is so too, but indirectly: as doing what so ever they do for obedience sake
(forsooth) to bring great masses of money, multitudes of friends and other
helps unto them, for their better and speedier advancement, by pulling down
all others that seek not their preferment, or have any favor showed them
independe^t upon them: a notable example whereof, was a tragical trick of Fa.
Parsons against one Master Fixer a secular Priest.

This very great and reverend man, as good a linguist as the most were of our
nation, coming into England with one master William Warford, a busy and
arrogant stirring headed body, (and therefore fittest to be a Jesuit, as
afterward he became one) together with Master Cecill (now a Doctor in Paris)
having all of them a protection from the Lord Treasurer, Sir William Cecill,
Lord Bourghley (that died last) an odious speech going out against them all at
the first for that cause: at length they all fled out of the land, By these and
innumer^ble the like examples a man may see how dangerous a matter it is to
come within a Jesuits danger: for either must he be an impudent copesmate
d^ponendo conscientiam to act any thing that the Jesuits will have acted: yea
and besides this he must (if out of credit with their masships) do some
desperate act, or bring some gain o^ commodity to them or theirs, or some
thing or other must he perform to their honor and credit, in testimony of
his loyalty toward these high conceited perfectiues, otherwise non introibit
in requiem eorum: as was manifest by all these. This good Cardinal (a worthier
then whom they never had on and in their society) being mo^^ sp^^^fully
infamed by these three Priests, (though in one pre^ic^ment of sp^e^e if any
were) yet the meanest of the three highly esteemed for his submission to the^,
swallowing up the greatest ga^^ge^^ they could give him under hand with out
once gasping at a haust: and the other ^wo, especially the chief Minister Fixer
never able to come in credit again, etc.
mightily persecuted by the Jesuits. Master Cecill went into Scotland where
he played on both sides, (as is thought he does still) like to one Master
Tilletson and some others: notwithstanding that Fa. Parsons had termed him a
very base fellow, a villain, a knave, a consiner and other like speeches he
used of him, of his fatherly zeal to an honorable Earl who told me it. The
other Master Warford as ambitious as any, (which his actions as well in Wales,
as in sundry places of the West country declared) seeing the only means to
recover his credit, and thereby to aspire, was to make the Jesuits his
friends (who then ruled the roast, and did what they list throughout England.)
He therefore insinuated himself so far, and became so officious on their
behalf, especially in getting an annual stipend from certain Catholics, for
Father Parsons mother and sister (being otherwise not able to live, and by
sundry of my friends, and mine own furtherance and procurement therein much
helped, otherwise his accounts had come short) that at length he became a young
father (forsooth) pater minister at Rome: and what a stickler he was in his new
office, I leave it to another discourse: how he went skulking in and out in the
English College, about the time of Cardinal Tolleds death, one while abroad
with gloria patri when news came that the Cardinal was dead: another while
retiring in mournful wise with non sicut erat in principio, when he heard he
was again revived: whom the Jesuits termed an Apostata, because this good
Cardinal having been erst a Jesuit, sought to bring them into order, which
was thought to have cost him his life: the Rector and his companions denying
the Students to come at funeral, or come in place of public prayers made for
him. And this for his part. Well, now to the third of that company. Master
Fixer was the man most hated of them, because he had spoken most on his Prince
and countries behalf against the Spaniards and their government, and
rebellious attempts and practices, as by a letter of his may well appear,
wherein he touches some pure spirited Jesuits fautors with infection of the
Spanish pippe (for these be his words) here in England. But in conclusion, he
was so vexed, lacerated, and calumniated by these Atheall Fathers, that he
became almost past himself: he renounced his protection, and in bitter tears
often bewailing his hard fortune, that his innocence could not save his
credit amongst devout, virtuous, and true meaning Catholics, as holden no
better then a spy for the State, an Apostata from his profession, and an
Atheist in his religion: yea the good Gentleman that kept him, was so
belabored, as inuitis dentibus and ensibus he was forced to leave him: and
yet, for that which is past, he has not recovered his credit to this day,
with that Puritanian Jesuitical faction. In conclusion, this reverend Priest
Master Fixer was constrained to leave the land, went thereupon into Spain,
and so into Portugal, where he intended to have been a Reader in some
religious house. And being at Lisbon in good credit, he procured the release of
some fourteen or fifteen English men there taken prisoners, willing them to
thank Master Bluet and Doctor Bagshaw for their liberty.

Hereof Father Parsons hearing (note well the Atheall emulation of this
Machiuilean) upon special notice and information had of the danger of
impairing the Jesuits credit (forsooth) if this secular Priest should be in
such high esteem within the King of Spaines dominions: he sent for him
presently into Spain under pretense of his preferment. But when he came, he no
sooner had him in his cloutches, but forthwith procured him to be laid in
prison for a spy, where he still remains, unless he be dead.

THE X. ARTICLE.
Whether then (the Jesuits arrogating an immunitie and liberty of speech,
hand and pen against all the world unto themselves) may it be, or is it
excusable, or otherwise to be holden as Atheall and irreligious in them, to
suffer their seditious faction and Jesuitical followers, that are lay persons:
as simple or busy headed men, women, boys, and girls, to defame, contemn,
and talk like ale-benchers at their pleasure, of Princes, Priests, and all
sorts of persons as they do: and (as in the two first general Quodlibets we
have delivered their impious dealings therein) is it therefore Atheall policy
in the Jesuits for their own advancement, and in defense of themselves against
all that are not currents of their fatal course, to set down principles and
books, or infamous libels of common places for their brothers to kon per
coeur, how to insinuate a detraction under color of zeal, religion,
affection, or otherwise against any whom it stands them upon, either to have as
an affied friend on live, or else pull down as an infest foe, upon his knees to
death: or may they not do so?

THE ANSWER.
IT is a most unchristian, Turkish, heretical and traitorous ground they stand
upon, and a promontorie far beyond all the capes and points of piety, lying
out into the dead sea, Persian gulf, or Stigian lake of perdition: to affirm,
that all whosoever (without exception of person, time or place) must be defamed
detracted, backbitten, despised and borne down, that are opposite to them and
their designements. And therefore by consequent their suffering (if not urging,
maintaining, commanding) the simpler sort so to do on their behalfes, is a new
way discovered by a back door, set open to the entrance of the sorest,
hatefullest, and most dangerous heresy, that ever yet was in the Christian
world: which all true Catholic hearts will tremble to think on, when they see
the effects of it apparently before their eyes, (as partly we have already,
and mean, God willing to touch it a little further to the quick ere these
Quodlibets be all ended) and bewail they shall with fear, grief and anger at
themselves: that ever coming into the Catholic church with religious, devout,
sincere meaning, care and desire of saving their own poor souls (for I am
not of that wretch Parsons mind, that none can be a right Catholic, or
established in Gods favor, unless he run his restless cursed race against
his Prince, country, and dear friends,) none I verily think (unless it were
some such Atheist as Parsons, or an odd reprobate amongst a thousand) but come
to be Catholic of mere remorce of conscience, for the love of God, and
resolute belief, that (howsoever any other is persuaded) this is the only
truth and way to walk in. In which though they may be damned by dying
impenitent for their offenses: yet out of it they cannot be saved, live they
otherwise never so morally virtuous. Coming then with this consolation: as a
special grace and mere gift of God infused into the soul of man, fully bent
to hazard credit, honor, favor, fortune, goods, lands, life and all, rather
then to loose their souls, by doing any one act against their own conscience
in points of religion, and service of God (for therein only, not in other
affairs does Saint Peter's sentence hold, obediendum maius est Deo quam
hominibus.) And being thus quieted in their mind, voyding their thoughts of all
temporizing, statizing, and seditious medlings with the affairs of Prince or
Peer: that they should notwithstanding have been so ready to believe these new
teachers of innouations, rebellions, invasions, conspiracies, hatred of their
Prince, defamation of the blond royal of the land, wishing for population to
their native country, havoc, spoil and destruction of all, for their
ambitious, unnatural, unlawful pleasures and desires; this shall grieve many
a devout Catholics heart, that ever after so many memorable, constant,
worthy, and happy conflicts with themselves in these dangerous times, of
soule-wrack: they should become so senseless, as to follow such false teachers,
and the erroneous doctrine of the Jesuits in these cases: this shall one day
cause many a virtuous Lady wring their hands for woe, that ever they were so
forward on these new Pharisees behalf: unnaturally, disloyally, inhumanely
bent against their Prince and country: and indiscreetely, irreligiously,
uncharitably against secular Priests. This I say shall make them ready to eat
their own nails, to remember their rash, vehement and cruel begun
persecution of their secular Priests their own ghostly fathers, the present
Apostles of their country, their dearest, nearest, and carefullest tender
hearted friends, prepared every hour to come upon their hands and knees, if
need require, to expose their poor worn out bodies for their sakes, to the
sorest trials on earth, rather then any the least danger of soule-wracke should
happen unto them by their means, or want of instruction, comfort, and
consolation in their sufferance for Gods cause.

And considering, that notwithstanding the Jesuits fautors (a most seditious
faction) have whetted their teeth to so sharp an edge, causeless against
those that never did them wrong, but much good many ways (as none of the
common adversaries were ever so eagerly bent against priesthood and Priests in
general, then they show themselves to be therein, by these cony-catching,
hypocritical mates procurements: yet still all being ready to shed their
blood in defense of one and the self same uniform Catholic faith and
religion, maintained outwardly on both sides alike: (I say outwardly on both
sides alike, because no Jesuit dare as yet openly maintain the contrary.) It
would seem impossible how that ever such malice, hatred, deep disdain and
contempt of any, either Prince or Priest could rest in a Catholic heart, as it
does generally in the Jesuits faction: were it not that in like cases we find,
how many thousands of seeming good Catholics, (and no doubt for the present
were so morally outward: for who does see the hearts of men but God alone, qui
scrutator cordium est, etc.) have been abused, seduced, and drawn by
peecemeale into most horrible blasphemies, heresies, contempt of the chief
mysteries and points of our salvation: by such as at the first did hoyst up
sails aloft, bare as great a countenance, and were as sound Catholics as any
Jesuit: nay as any the most religious Priest, Monk, Nun, or Friar that is
on live: and yet just by like singularity, ambition, arrogancy and aspiring
humors, fell away into such gross errors and heresies, as afterward they
did maintain even to death. For neither Pelagius, nor Beringarius, nor
Nouatus, nor Arius, nor any other, but had as good, holy, virtuous, devout,
religious, and seeming settled and established men and women in the grace of
God, that were their followers at the first, and that stood in defense of them
as earnestly, faithfully, resolutely, devoutly, and zealously in their kind, as
any pure spirit, these new illuminates have at this present to plead for
them. Neither did, neither durst any of these heretics maintain their error
openly at the first, but by degrees, being crossed in their proud conceits.
First they raised a sedition and dislike of their ancient fathers, teachers
and governors, then taught secretly strange paradoxes and opinions amongst
the ignotant people, which might be interpreted diverse ways: after that (vt
est natura hominum nouitatis auida) finding how that new names, strange words,
and other novelties out of use in the Church of God (as hereafter shall be
proved of the Archpresbiterie) did breed an admiration to be had of them, as
rare learned men, and I know not what: then from the mobile vulgus they
proceeded further to draw great persons, Nobles, Honors and Graces
promiscually unto them: upon that again, perceiving exceptions to be taken
against them (as there is always some dog in the dorter of Gods Church
waking, ready to bark at every passe-by out of the way, thereby rowzing the
Lioness the sweet spouse of Christ, who sleeps with open eyes day and night
beholding what is done or said every where) being noted of singularity, and
suspected of innovation by sundry tergiuersations, equivocations,
sophistications, windings, twindings, tracings, and doublings, being often
driven to repeal, recall, recant, renounce and deny all their doings,
speeches, practices and proceedings in seducing of the innocent, at length when
they could color their malice, ambition and lewdness no longer, then lo they
burst out into open wars against the Catholic church, and dividing
themselves from all other Catholics (as in a sort the Jesuits at Wisbich
first, and now since throughout England do begin pretily well to ominate what
they aim at) affirming that the Catholic church was only and wholly amongst
them, and that all others that were not of their company, were Schismatickes or
Heretics: they then advanced their dismal banners, and so many thousands
(otherwise virtuous devout, and religious persons) were thus seduced by them,
became absurd heretics in following of them: and in the end died (many
thousands loosing their lives, and many hundred thousands of souls perishing)
in defense of them and their heretical doctrine, sects and opinions. And even
like to all other heretical proceedings, is this course that the Jesuits take:
God amend them, or cut them off, that no Catholics be ever seduced in the end
of their downfall by them.

THE ARGUMENT OF THE fifth General Quodlibet.
BY reason of the great obloquie, hatred and disgrace that the English nation
is brought into by the Jesuits practices, (as in the last Quodlibet appears,
and especially concerning the English Students at Rome most cruelly handled by
the seditious faction of the Jesuits,) it follows sitly in this place, to put
forth a Quodlibet of Government, to search out, what may be the Jesuits
drift in plotting for the sway, sword and authority every where to be in
their hands Therefore shall this fifth general Quodlibet be of their plots by
government and rule in manner following.

THE FIFTH QVODLIBET of Plots by Government.
THE I. ARTICLE.
WHether the Jesuits or the Seminary Priests be fitter for Government in the
Colleges beyond the seas, and whether of the two is more necessary, either
respecting Gods church, or the weal of our country, to have the bringing up
of English youths there?

THE ANSWER.
IF Cardinal Boromeus (whose rare virtues all Europe talked of, had had the
hearing of this disputation, and been vmpier, moderator, or judge paramount of
this question) he would sure have been on the Seminary and secular Priests
side. For this good Cardinal observing well the pride of the Jesuits, their
practices for enriching, advancing and bringing of themselves to be admired at
of all men (right Lucifer like, as much as to say, am I not the chief) and
their conicatching devises, for alluring of the finest wits, children of most
towardness, and those of rarest aspects, and greatest hopes to their spiery,
having intelligence how they held in diverse Seminaries within the Duchy of
Millan the like course and state, taken upon them under color of teaching and
bringing up of youths there, as they did in other countries and provinces about
him, and where ever they came, he thought them no fit men to remain within his
jurisdiction. Whereupon he banished them out of all these places: esteeming it
far more necessary to have such apt men, and those of the finest wits,
quickest spirits, and likeliest to prove great clerks, to become secular
Priests (as those appointed by institution divine to take upon them the care of
souls: and therefore woe unto them if they be ignorant in the law they are to
give and expound to their flock and charge.) This he prudently conceited, as
it was more convenient, yea of bounden duty for those that were indifferent
what state of life they took them unto in the Church of God, rather to have
them secular Priests then intruded into any order of religion or monastical
life whatsoever: which intermedleth not ex professo with any such charge: but
live after the prescript rules of their orders, private to themselves as their
vow and profession binds them unto: and none more then the Jesuits, if they
say true, or as they would sometimes, for a device make people believe they do.
So as it cannot be otherwise (which this worthy Cardinal well noted in them)
but that the Jesuits in all their practices, plots and pretenses (shadowed
over with never so condensate a bright color of religious zeal) aim at a
higher mark in the apple of the worlds eye: then to do all things gratis, and
of poor pure devotion, charity, humility, obedience, and I cannot tell how
many Academicall virtues and perfections, which must (forsooth) be attributed
unto these perfect statesmen and religious illuminates. For how is it possible
if they had any good, religious, Catholic or bare Christian meaning with them,
that they should make exceptions of persons, in admitting none into their
company or society, but such as either by his wit, wealth, birth, or other
means, may bring some gain, help and means to their further preferment and
advancement here on earth.

You progeny of vipers (to use our Saviors words against you) the offals of
the old Scribes and Pharisees: who has taught you to eschew iram venturam, to
sequestrate your selves from the world: to take upon you a state of perfection:
and to include and exclude: to choose and refuse: to force whom you list (or
otherwise to rail upon them and condemn them to hell on live in your arrogant
censures) and to thrust back whom you like not of, that gladly would enter in:
no doubt but of a religious conceit they have of you, though happy those that
are so thrust out from among you. Is this your holy society? Is this your
perfection of life? Is this your zeal of souls? Is this your freedom from
error? Is this your skill of government? Is this your doctrine of
reformation? Is this your familiarity with God? Is this your neerenesse by
illuminated admittance to know secrets to others unknown: that you dare put
out and put in whom you please to have this familiarity, and to be illuminated
as you vainly vaunt of? No, fie blasphemous wretches, you prejudice Christ our
Savior, his sweet spouse, and his sacred anointed Priests. Nos talem
consuetudinem non habemus neque Ecclesia Dei. Never was there any religious
order that took your course: nor held such fantastical, extrauagant,
exorbitant, irregular opinions as you do. It is flat singularity, innovation,
and absurdity of your idle brains, without any authority either of the
Catholic Church, or Scripture for you: to single out any one soul in this
sort. Did our Savior teach, did his Apostles practice, did the Church deliver
by tradition unto you, that you might or ought to admit none but wise: but
wealthy: but of great parentage, or busy headed bodies into your society? Was
heaven made, did Christ suffer his bitter death and passion: left he an order
in his Church, that none should be admitted into a state of perfection, but
either rich folks, or Philosophers, or Princes (for howsoever you teach to the
contrary openly, yet your practice shows it to be your meaning privately.)
No, no: (seditious Choristes, Dathanians and Abironistes) there is no such text
of Scripture, nor Cannon of Apostle, nor Decree of ecumenicall Synod, nor
Tradition of the Church, nor consent of Doctors, nor rule nor principle, nor
any the least clause in the foundation of your society, or confirmation of the
same by the Apostolical Roman Sea: that makes for you in this point of
singularity, election and choice.

The doctrine of the Catholic Church, consists of three special principia or
causes (rightly so termed in Christian Philosophy) the one supplying locum
materiae, scil. fides: the other formae vel efficientis, scil. charitas, and
the last: finalis, scil. spes) called of Divines the three Theologicals,
because they are all infused, and none of them acquisite virtues. The first is
faith, as the gate without which none can enter into Gods house, either here
militant on earth, or triumphant in heaven: for accedentem ad Deum oportet
credere, etc. The second is charity: as the way by which poor sinners walk
in their journey toward heaven: which whosoever wants, if he have faith able
to remove mountains, give all he has to the poor, and his body to the fire:
yet without charity shall he never come there, Si charitatem non habuero,
nihil sum. The third is hope, as the finiall end of our entrance into the
Church of God, and cause of our progress in a virtuous course of life therein:
which is to be partakers of a glorious resurrection, and to enjoy eternal
blessedness: for if it were not in hope of this miserabiliores essemus omnibus
hominibus. Of these three the Apostle says manent tria haec fides spes
charitas: mayor autem horum est charitas: as much to say as this: it is hope
that moves us to trot and trudge, and take such pains to come to heaven: it is
faith that opens the way thither, without which God can never be pleased: but
charity is the form and cause efficient, and therefore as a golden mean and
chief of three, she gives the Crown to King and Queen: and remains in
heaven for evermore.

Now tell me you illuminates of high aspires, wherein does your familiarity
and approximation to the inaccessible light consist? I know you will not be
Solifidians, because you smell more of Familians. And if you will be neither of
both, but believe as the Catholic Church believes: then why does not your
words and deeds agree in one? You know our sweet Savior died for all alike:
and yet neither all, nor half, nor third, nor tenths of all shall be saved.
You know the merits of Christ Jesus extended on his part equally to Jew and
Gentile, Christian and Heathen, faithful and infidel, Catholic and Heretic:
and as well to those that lived in the time of his death and passion, as to
those that died in Noes time, or are now, or shall be borne hereafter to the
worlds end: and yet but one kind, to wit, the faithful livers, members of the
Catholic Church: for, vnus Deus, vna fides, vnum Baptisma, and vnica est
columba mea: and would God all of that one company and body mystical might be
saved. You know it is not Gods will absolute but permissiue, that any one soul
should perish: and yet herein is an insoundable deapth, which a nearer friend
of Gods then any of you are, calling to mind the Prophets speech: Jacob dilexi
Esau autem semper odio habui, durst never define upon: but concluded with
nescit homo vtrum odio vel amore dignus sic. You know that infirma elementa
huius mundi elegit Deus vt fortia quaeque confunderet: that Christ chose for
his Apostles innocent, plain, and simple men, without gust or gaul, welt or
guard: and that he confessed unto his heavenly father, and humbly acknowledged
it as a special favor: quia abscondisti haec (says he) a sapientibus and
prudentibus, and reuelasti ea paruulis. Which paruuli I can never be persuaded
was meant of the Jesuitical elated spirit, but rather of a Seraphicall Friar,
whose patron sweet S. Francis, has justly for his innocence and true humility
abounding in his charity that Gospel appointed for his day. In few you know,
that if heaven were only prepared for rich men, then beggars might go abegging
indeed. If for Gentles, Nobles, and great Princes: then boores, pesants,
carters and plow-men might well entreat Peers Penilesse to make a supplication
for them to the devil. If for Academickes, Peripatetickes, Stoickes, Epicures,
and other Philosophers: or else if for Samothists, Solonists, Licurgions, and
other Lawyers: or otherwise if for Petrists; Thomistes, Scotists, and other
schoolmen, learned, wise and profound Clearkes: then poor souls what should
become of simple men and silly women: they might all go hang themselves in
deep despair. If all these three be required in one person (as commonly you
Jesuits hunt after such buckes of the first head but yet with a velvet pawme)
then alas for woe: how shall ever those come in heaven, that have neither
quality of body to get it, nor gift of mind to gain it, nor quillet of land
to buy it, nor quidditie of wit to keep it? No, no, proud Pharisees you are
deceived: Non est personarum exceptio coram Deo: neither has he left the
kingdom of heaven to be given to one more then to another, for any humane gift
or quality in them. Sed qui potest capere capiat. It is laid open to all
alike, and only the truest lovers carry away the greatest trophies: and
charitable emulation (who may love their Lord God most dearly) that is the
only spiritual strife for heaven, amongst all those that ever come thither:
regnum caelorum vim patitur and violenti rapiunt illud. It is neither gotten by
poyse of words, by pregnancie of wit, by brag of birth, by boast of wealth:
by dint of sword, or prick of spear. Only such a prick does prick it, as
pricks the heart of God and man, and no humane creature is exempted, but all
admitted to have that heavenly Caduceus stricken into their hearts.

Not the poorest beggar, nor simplest soul, nor basest body that lives, but
has the touch of love and affections, as naturally inserted in his will: as
has the greatest Monarch under heaven: and therefore all alike near to God by
creation, by redemption, by natures incline in every one: Love divine (which we
call charity) making no distinction of persons, but by the measure of their
affections. And so true it is dimissa sunt ei peccata multa quoniam dilexit
multum. Et qui plus diligit, ei plus dimittitur. Hereupon rises the common
opinion to carry sense with it: that poor, that simple, that mean, that
ignorant men and women, go sooner to heaven, then rich, then noble, then
learned, then such wise wisards as you Jesuits are. The reason whereof can be
none other then this: For that these three virtues, faith, hope and charity
being the gifts of God, and not to be gotten by Aristotle's wit, nor Caesar's
might, nor Cresus his wealth: the simple meaner and poorer sort, suffer God
Almighty ordinarily to work more freely, firmly, and sweetly in their hearts (
vtpote suauiter disponens omnia, abundantly supplying their other defects) then
in theirs, who thinking themselves to be jolly fellows, will contend by reason
or otherwise with the giver of all things: and so strive to give God check
mate, or to be half with him in their proud Nemrodian aspires. Which is the
cause that they often suffer a Luciferian fall: which other that seek not to
clime so high are free from. And for this cause it is, and has ever been in
use (save amongst you Jesuits) that those who did take themselves to a
religious course of life, did it in simplicitate cordis, voiding their thoughts
of all promotions, popular applause, or other gain, to accrue unto them
thereby.

Therefore do I conclude, that by all probable conjecture, there is not one
amongst a hundredth that goes to be a Jesuit, that has any true religious
intent in him: but a proud, ambicious, vain glorious, aspiring mind. For what
has poverty to do with riches? what, contempt of the world with worldly
honors? what an abject life, with birth and parentage? what, original
innocence, with sinful policy? what, solitariness with panigeries of praises?
what, mortification with popular applauses? what, religious renunciation, with
fame and renown? what, perfect humility, with vaunting arrogance? what Cells
and Cloisters, with Courts and Palaces? what, true obedience, with
controlement of Princes? what, Monastical exercise, with Ecclesiastical: nay
with temporal, mechanical, mundane affairs? Is this your profession of so
high perfection? O that all states in Christendom would follow Cardinal
Boroneus his example, either in banishing of you quite out of Europe, or at
least in pulling in your horns, until you were brought into some better
order, moderation, and knowledge of your selves. For my part I confess unto
you, that as I have hitherto always prayed and enjoined others to do the like,
for peace, unity, and concord betwixt you and the seculars: so shall it be my
continual prayer hereafter: that (howsoever other states do, it may please God
of his mercy to look upon our afflicted country, and to move the heart of his
Holiness, to call you out from amongst us here, until your insolency be
abated: and withal to remove all Jesuits for ever out of the English College
at Rome: where there are other manner of practices then were ever attempted by
any Jesuit in the territories of Millan, nay or I think in the Christian world
besides: many reverend, virtuous secular Priests being sent home into England,
laden till their backs cracked with the Jesuits calumniations and slanders:
and none but such as will be Jesuitical wholly, and not perfunctory, may find
any favor there. Therefore cursed be the hour that ever they got entrance in
that College: and cursed be the time that ever they set foot on English
ground, and a triple curse unto them all, that to maintain their ambition,
pride, and seditious factions, have scandalized the whole world: brought our
nation into reproach and obloquie, and heaped the hot coals of furious
burning, nay, consuming flames of fire, famine and sword, upon afflicted
Catholics, with their own and their native countries ruin, destruction, and
desolation, so much as in them lies. And sure, he or she hereafter that shall
send their children, or go themselves, to become students at Rome or elsewhere
under their government, do either by co^sequent cast themselves into a
voluntary slavery, as bad as if under the great Turk: or else must they change
the true nature of an English heart, and become traitors or sautors of
conspiracies against their Prince, country, and dearest friends.

THE II. ARTICLE.
Whether then (seeing the Jesuits are so infest enemies to all that are not
Iesuited: and that it is a destruction to our English youth to be brought up
under them, as far more fitting to have secular Priests to be governors over
them at Rome and other places,) do they intend if they prevail in England to
advance any secular or other English Priest to Ecclesiastical dignity, or else
some seculars, of other nations: or none at all?

THE ANSWER.
I Told you before if you remember, that they have made a Puritanian division
of the Ecclesiastical state in their high Council of Reformation for England:
wherein amongst other things a statute is made for abrogation of all Episcopal
dignity, and that just like to the Puritanian or the Cartwrightian, or the
Brownistian, or the Geneuian, or the Gehenian platform: there shall a new
order or government be brought into the Church, whose governors shall consist
of six seniors or elders (in the congregation of Bedlems or Dutch Peers, or
what you will call them:) whereof the seculars shall be as it were Chaplins to
the Jesuits, as Pater Rector and Pater minister, that is father Parsons and his
minister. So as clear it is, that the Jesuits will always have some seculars
amongst them, either to use as asses to lay their load upon (if any thing
happen amiss amongst them:) or else as Iebusees in this land of promise (made
unto them by the king of Spain, as they report) left for these choice people
of God to work upon. But howsoever it happen, I find no mention made in that
statute, whether the seculars must be aliens and strangers, or of a native
brood: that shall be put to these mean offices. For it were an indecent thing,
that the great fathers should desist from preaching, dealing with Princes and
high affairs and ministrare mensis. No fie, God forbid their honors should so
basely be stained: and the matter I think is disputable, whether they shall be
all Spaniards, or all English, or of a mixed hotch potch of all, or so many
sundry nations. But I think sure the last: for it were no policy to have them
all of one nation, but rather like the Turks Bassaes, and Ianissaries of
omnium gatherum. So that if any of the English Priests be admitted to that
servile dignity, it is very like to be the Archpriest (were it not that more
probable it is that father Parsons will have about with him for old done
deeds) or Doctor Worthington, or Doctor Turner, or some hot spur of the
assistants, or such one or other, as may be fittest to serve their turn for
the time. Mary for any of our nation to be in the highest rooms save only
Jesuits, that is not a thing to be looked for, as too arrogant a part for any
to think of it. Yea Doctor Allane troubled them much with thought and care,
where to have bestowed that silly simple man, if the Spaniard had prevailed in
the year 88. For to have made him only a Pater minister, they could not with
honesty, because he was then a Cardinal: and to have made him Archbishop of
Canterbury, or York, or Bishop of London, these were all too high places for
him, as not a man of sufficiency to govern or deal in such affairs as these
places did require. And again the Spaniards should have been our Bishops for a
time, and the English Jesuits their Interpreters. So as it was a very difficult
and doubtful case, what should have become of the poor Cardinal, till at
length (considering he could not live long) they determined to have bestowed
some of the meanest Bishoprikes in the land upon him: as Carlisle or some such
like: Sed parturiant montes nascetur ridiculus mus, all turned to a jest, there
was no such matter.

THE III. ARTICLE.
Whether then do the Jesuits intend in that case the preferment of any
temporal person (seeing they intend no secular) of England, or not, in the
temporal state?

THE ANSWER.
THey do questionless intend it: for the preferment of some, for a while at
the first: otherwise they had no policy in them (for I doubt not of their
ingratitude further then to serve their turns withal.) First for that some of
their greatest adversaries of the temporal Lords, as the Lord Dacre, etc. are
no way to be bearded out, but by their joining with some such honorable
persons, as may and will make the Jesuits quarrel theirs, against him for
their own advantage. Secondly, for that it cannot otherwise be, but that there
are many secret promises, with bonds, vows and protestations deeply made of
sundry great and high preferments to those that now are sticklers for them.
Thirdly, for that they have received large sums of sundry great persons
already: and therefore must repay them upon other men's lands, etc. Fourthly,
for that they are not able to win, nor yet keep this so mighty a Monarchy,
but by the aid of such, etc. But yet shall none of these be so advanced, but
that they shall stand at the Jesuits devotion: as now the Archpriest does, to
continue so long, and no longer then is for their turn, and that they shall be
ruled and subjected under them.

THE IIII. ARTICLE.
WHether then seeing it appears plain we shall have a change if the Jesuits
prevail, do they intend a change of government in the Monarchy only, or
therewithal in the Universities: Innes of Court and Chancery, and in all other
Colleges, corporations, companies and societies also: or do they only aim at
some few chief houses? etc.

THE ANSWER.
NOw when you talk of societies, you make me remember the new buildings in
Edenborough called the College or society house of the City: where the
Puritanes have many pretty orders, observations, and rules set down amongst
them for government, not much unlike the orders of the Jesuits society. For
all these new illuminates must have one trick or other of innovation and
singularity in every thing. And so I make no question of it: but if the
Jesuits prevail, they intend, and will turn all things topsie turuie, vpside
down, sincke shall up and sice shall under: a dead man shall rise and do great
wonder: not so much as the society drink but shall quite be changed: and a
lack what ailes my minnie at me heigh hoe.

In Parsons high Council of Reformacion (wherein as those report that have
seen it, this whole monarchical I Will containing England, Scotland, and
Ireland, is made a Province depending upon Spain and Iesuitisme) all the whole
state must be changed, as I told you before: and the lands and seigniories of
Clergy and Nobility, Universities, Colleges, and what not, must be altered,
abridged or taken quite away. Yea these popular Francklines great rich farmers
or muckle carles of the country: these Kentish yeomen, vntriall Gentlemen the
Jesuits officers, must be authorized to confiscate certain houses of special
note in particular, as this ignoble bastard Parsons in his vain, childish, but
arrogant hope has already in conceit confiscated Cecill house to be Casa
professa, and another there by it to be Nouitiatum: and so of others, all must
be changed into noua vitia, yea such vices as were never heard of before. For
it is an imagined principle amongst the Jesuits (which infatuates them to
adventure credit, conscience and all) that where they once set footing, they
must prevail.

Upon which vain conceit, their tormenting and troubling every nation where
they come, causes religion to be blasphemed: never any thing prospering in
Gods Church where they come, and have any meddling or dealing. France abounded
with Hugonites (a kind of Puritanes) and was never quiet so long as they were
there: and yet now we see the Catholic religion has maruelously increased
since they for their sedition, treacheries, conspiracies, were justly banished
thence. How mightily Polonia was pestered and troubled by them: it appears in
a book entitled Equitis Poloni in Iesuitas anno primo. Yea the Danskers made
it an objection of not admittance of the Sweden king, to be their Sovereign
without condition of expelling the Jesuits from his Court and Counsel, what
fruit the Indians have reaped by them, the Spaniards shall themselves report
it. But so it is that by the cruelty of the Jesuits and Spaniards together
(let them take it betwixt them) they are brought into that hatred, as there is
expected rebellions and reuolts from under King Philips allegiance every
hour. The like is of their garboiles in Italy, Spain, Germany, and other
places: and for England we have said enough already: all the world sees it,
what mischief they have brought and wrought amongst us. Neither I will
warrant, shall you hear of one Jesuit, that ever will acknowledge himself
faulty: nor say with Jonas: Si orta sit haec tempestas propter me, proijcite me
in mare: no it stands not with their lofty humility, nor Atheall obedience,
nor Pharisaicall zeal to do so; sed ex fructibus eorum cognoscetis eos. Name
me that nation that ever prospered in those actions, wherein the Jesuits dipped
their fingers in the fat, or had any special commodity or gain in re or in
spe thereby. What good have they done in the Low Countries, or in Germany, or
in Scotland, or in any other place where they come? Only this they have done:
they come in with gloria patri every where: and until they have, like great
fawcons or hawks of the Tower, firmly seized upon the pray, killed, at randon,
wing, or souce, they proceed forward with and filio, holding the panting heart
fast in their talents (for every puny Jesuit, though he be scarce able to say
boe to a goose, yet must he be as a correlatiue to his admired at holy father,
his Jesuit predecessor, that went before him: and so by consequent a ravening
bird of pray, to make poor fowls, I should have said silly fools, sweet
souls, to tremble and quake:) Marry afterward finding store of game,
fawconers and spaniels innough at beck and command to discover the Couee, and
spring the Partridge at their pleasure: and withal taking an extraordinary
delight in preying upon such sweet young birds, and tender flesh (and herein no
one nation under the coape of heaven, yielding more nor of greater pleasance of
both sexes then England does) then lo they begin cantare nobis canticum nouum,
with, non sicut erat in principio, sed vt est nunc, and semper erit, until a
better advantage come for another change. And thus play they Madge good cow, as
erst I told you: scil. they give a good mess of milk, and when they have
done, throw it down with their foot. They preach sound doctrine, give
wholesome counsel, draw many back from a loose and dissolute life: but after
they have once gotten firm footing, they cast all down with three lofty
capers of pride, ambition and arrogancy. Which three makes them forget both
God and all good Saints, and turn their religious piety into sacrilegious
policy: still tampering about kingdoms, monarchies, commonwealths and
temporal states, how to bring them into mutinies, contentions, seditions,
rebellions and vproares: that thereby, whilst two dogs are a snarling together
about a boane (perhaps but a brabble de lana caprina) they like a company of
ours may come in and snatch away the boane from both of them. For even so is
the Jesuits vain hope of the English monarchy, as in the Antiperistasis I have
set out more at large.

THE V. ARTICLE.
WHether then seeing the Jesuits must in policy prefer some temporal Lords,
and great persons (for a time at the least, if they prevail) do they favor,
seek, or wish for the preferment of any of the blood royal of England, borne
under English allegiance or not?

THE ANSWER.
THey wish no more, nor so much for the preferment of any English, be he or she
of the blood or no (for all is one in that case, as hereafter shall be proved
against thee^) as they do for a Scot, or a Spaniard, or a Flemming or German,
or any other: marry yet in a different manner, using the help and aid of every
nation to cou^teruaile the one or the other withal. So that in policy none
must bear too great a sway under them: least they keep all from the rest, and
so thrust them out also. And therefore shall their authorities be limited, and
the number set down, how many English, how many Spanish, how many Scots, how
many Irish, how many Flemmings, how many Germans: and no doubt, but there
shall be some Italians, French, Polonians, Bohemians, Portugals, etc.

THE VI. ARTICLE.
Whether then labor they for the establishment of this their government more
by the means of England, or Scotland, or Spain, or Austria and Burgundy: and
what nation is it they hope and affie most in the intended conquest?

THE ANSWER.
THey labor in esse directly for the Spaniard and Burgundian: in spe, for any
that they think for the time present may sted the^ most: which hope being past
of one then, for another again: as one while for Parma: another while for
Darby, etc. But in re, they labor for none at all, more one then another: save
only as I said before, to make a hotchpotch of all together: setting the
subjects of each nation by peecemeale against their Sovereigns, and this
famous I Will, to be a Scot to them all: that is a collection, flocking or
gathering together of all nations, people and languages throughout the world,
that have any Jesuit of or in the country where they live.

THE VII. ARTICLE.
Whether then have they any wish or intent of marriage for any of the blood
royal of England, or whether for any one more then another: or none at all?

THE ANSWER.
THey could wish no question of it (as hereafter shall be proved) that there
were not one of the blood of England left on live, either within or without the
land, as a special help and mean, if it were so, to further their popularity
thereby. But as now it is, they could wish them all bestowed in opposition one
against another, to make the title more doubtful, and the rightful claim
more difficult and dangerous: as those that care not which way the game go, so
they go not out: or who be preferred, so the English state and commonwealth be
not strengthened in it self thereby against the intended Allobrogicall
government: which is the only thing they fear: as by all their practices it
is apparent to be seen: and especially by their traiterous speeches, and
disgracings of all the English blood royal in public writings: and yet
covertly under hand working, now for one and then for another, as chance and
change affoords them hope and favor.

THE VIII. ARTICLE.
Whether then their chief pretense being religion, and setting up and
advancing and restoring of the Catholic Roman faith: as in all father Parsons
books, and other of his and his fellows writings, conferences and speeches it
may appear: do they seek willingly, absolutely, and sincerely the conversion
of all or any of the blood royal of England, or of none at all: but for a
fashions sake to blind well meaning Catholics, with a pretended color of
religious zeal?

THE ANSWER.
THey are wholly sick of the fashio^s in these their seditious factions. But
yet for fashions sake, they have a new fashion, by which is fashioned all their
fashions, follies and deceits: and that is to have a new trick of a viridary
post or current of time to gain time withal, in keeping Nobles, State and all
the people in suspense of events, until they have what they look for. And this
is a practice of very high importance. I cannot tell what to say to the^, they
have so many Machiuilean devises, as every plot and drift seems to be an
infallible rule of falsehood, and a principle in chief, whereby father Parsons
and his adherents do so square their actions, as never a Prince in
Christendom, nor any man living can tell where to find them, or how to trace
or trust them: they are so uncertain, and so full of forms, fashions,
turnings and doublings, as never wild March hare had more. For they hold out,
only as time serves: now filling all their sails, and then launching forth
with a fair gale of wind: and again within a ken casting anchor, with a
breath in a plausible calm: and yet presently after with a whirlwind for
another purpose, hail in the bol, and hoyst up sail, pumpe amain, and cast
all upon the starboord but took for a time. Time the^ being the length, change
the breadth, and co^formity the rule they square by: I can judge none otherwise
of their intent for co^uersio^ of any one, then as of their like meaning in
other practices: which is, that if they have any use of a man (who yet perhaps
is not altogether for their purpose in all things) they make fair weather with
him for the time, and afterward, lest he should expect some extraordinary favor
or benefit at their hands, they have twenty dog-trickes, new ways and devises
by detracting (which by their maxim is called gaining or winning of time) how
to shake him off very Iesuitically, and he never the wiser of it. Of this
principle observed amongst the Jesuits for winning of time, father Cryton a
Scot. Jesuit (I think ouerslipping himself at unawares in his words) told the
Lord Dacre, being then in Spain (put in hope of great matters, but impatient
in delays) that it was their manner, when they had one of his account and
calling, that although they could not, or at least would not perform what they
promised, or put the party in hope of: yet was it in policy for them to draw
him on, without giving him any resolute answer to the contrary: as the only
way to gain time: so that by keeping him there, put off with lingering hope in
delays, they might the easier either act some other action by him to serve
their turns withal (which upon the sudden could not be in readiness to be
enterprised) or else prevent some inconvenience, which might happen unto them
by his present departure or absence in another place. Notwithstanding the Lord
Dacre having had sufficient warning given him before, as well by the Noble
Duchess of Feria, half sister to Sir Robert Dormer, nephew to the said Lord by
marriage (who has often showed a true natural English Ladies heart, even
living in a Spanish soil, against these unnatural Parsonian practices) as
also by the said father Criton (who bid his Lordship in effect look for none
other, then to have father Parsons his mortal enemy for ever: by reason of
his refusal to favor or further the title of the Lady Infanta, and for his
free and liberal speech on the behalf of his Prince and country against all
foreign pretenders, etc.) expected no less, as since he has found, then most
injurious calumniations against him every where. Yet used Parsons often
dalliance with his Lordship, either to make him break off friendship some with
his dearest friends: or else to feed him with hopes or gifts, to color other
guiles, or to remove some old stools to make him break his shinnes upon them,
etc.

It was a pretty jest, to hear how they cogd with master Cecill after he had
gotten his protection here in England, and how by gaining time of putting him
off with hope of present parley this day and that day, and at such a place now,
and then at another, they made him trudge and course both tide, Thames and time
with cross encounters, until he was weary of it. But of all the rest, they
used a faithful servant of theirs, Doctor Barret president at Doway most
unthankfully: which because it is the very Anatomy of all the Jesuits base
gained time, I will set it out word for word as it is in the original, wherein
I found it: yet very briefly there delivered.

This master Barret was for a long time one of the Jesuits chief darlings,
and a special instrument to many purposes: whom they requited in the end with
all manner of disgusts and disgraces, even to his last breath. For being sent
for up to Rome about the breach of the students with the Jesuits: Cardinal
Tolet hoping he would have taken part with the seculars, intended to have made
him Rector there, and to have cast out all the Jesuits as he did cast out six
of them. But Master Barret contrary to the Cardinals expectation, became
wholly Iesuited, and did what he could in favor of them against the students.
Whereupon Cardinal Tolet rejected him as an unworthy man. The Jesuits
afterward sent him down to Doway to his old charge: and father Parsons the
archcousiner craftily made him purchase a house which cost 1200. crowns, and
withal stopped at Rome the Popes pension for the College the space of two
years. By these occasions Doctor Barret in behalf of the College fell in
debt 3000. crowns: the Jesuits all this while keeping from him the annual
pensions. With this the Doctor at length being moved, sending to Rome to
complain and require the money: gentle father Parsons went to the Pope, and
accused him of excess and evil husbandry, in disposing the Popes Pensions.
And so by this means through gain of time, suffering the house to fall in
extremity, father Parsons gained two commodities thereby: one was thereupon to
send into England for collections to be made: and that none should come over
unto Doway without twenty pounds or a good large sum in their purses, by reason
of the great want that the College was in: another, that hereupon through
tract of time, he got advantage of the poor President, as though the College
had decayed through his default: and so intended upon that occasion to have
cast him out, and have thrust in Jesuits in his place, saving that his death
prevented it. But other matters falling out here in England contrary to their
expectation about their Atchpresbiter: it was thought necessary for gaining of
time a while longer, not as yet to place there the Jesuits, but one Doctor
Worthington for a time to be a stickler to gain time by for them.

Thus you see the Jesuits axiom of winning, redeeming or gaining of time is
nothing else in effect, then to run withal times, in altering their
positions, by three general rules or propositions (used now one way and the^
another as a medius terminus for every doubtful argument) one is tempora
mutantur: ergo nos mutamur in illis: Another is: omnia pro tempore: ergo nihil
pro veritate. The last is: divide and imperia at all times, so as the division
of the spoil being in thine own hands, thou may make it serve thy turn, to
win by time thy desires. The practice of which ground is in no Jesuits affair
so manifest, as in this very point and platform for their English
government: laboring to outward show to set up now one, then another:
intending it for none at all in very deed: as by conferring of one thing with
another, may be easily discovered in their practices. For it is not unknown
to all the Christian world (as I verily think) that in Rome, in Spain, in
Flaunders and every where: but especially here in England, Scotland and
Ireland, they labor to stir up all men, under color of religion and zealous
desire in them, of our countries conversion: against our Sovereign, the
present State, and above all against the seculars, accusing them to be fautors
of heretics, furtherers of heretics titles to the English Crown, and a
faction (forsooth) we must be termed, by a company of Montebankes, that have
put this phrase into ignorant peoples heads, that when they talk of any that
is opposite to these seditious Jesuits damnable courses, they must say: o, he
is one of the faction: when like a company of asses, if they knew what a
faction meant, they might easily discern that these their new masters did
ride them (like fools, as they are) and made them become a most seditious,
infamous, pragmaticall, treacherous, diabolical faction, to set up and defend
a bastardly fellow in all his mischievous plots and devises: and that the
seculars are of no faction at all: unless they will call it a faction to join
against these usurpers with the whole Church of God: and so may they (as
probably like right heretics, they will do so one day) say that all Catholic
nations throughout Christendom, are of the faction: there being no Catholic
country, people, or nation in the world this day, but does dislike of them,
and is against their wicked proceedings: or else for speaking in defense of
their Prince and country, I mean in matters of government, succession, and
state affairs, clearly abstracted from points of faith and religion: and then
and therein also, if they say the seculars are of the faction, they may as well
say, that her Majesty and honorable Counsel, and in few, all that are
exempted from traiterous attempts and conspiracies, either within or without
the land, are so. And then by consequent, all are of the faction throughout the
world, that will not yield to a Jesuitical supremacy in the state
Ecclesiastical, and to their Monarchy in a state temporal: and in both, to
make father Parsons a king Cardinal.

Concerning this matter it is worthy the noting, to see how this Camelion
Jesuit Parsons, has banded off and on with time, like a Protheus. His and his
fautors ostentation in outward show, is wholly for religion, and that they do
most earnestly desire the conversion of their country, and of such and such
particular persons by name: yea they would (I marry would they) all follow, and
prosecute the king of Scots title, if he would become Catholic: but if not,
they would all dye one after another against him. And yet contrary to this
ostentation made, both in a letter of father Parsons to the Marquis Huntley
(whom they account to be a special fautor of their faction) as also contrary
to sundry other of their writings, schedules and passages, they have dealt
both privately and openly to the contrary. In so much that (omitting particular
practices, as with the late Earl of Essex, to whom father Parsons sent a
Jesuit Priest, to have had him to take a pension of the king of Spain
privately, for advancement of his designements, never mentioning any Religion to
him, off or on: but be as he be would: and so with others has he dealt
besides) the viper showed his malice most in the treaty of peace, betwixt the
kings of France and Spain. For at that time there was a rumor run abroad,
that the Queen of England would enter into that league, and so grant a
tolleration of religion. But this, father Parsons utterly disliked of: saying,
that either they would have all or none: that they would admit of no
conditions. His reason was this: because (quoth he) a tolleration would make
the Catholics of England dull and without spirit, etc. But the reason indeed
was this (and in good faith when I first did see the Articles here drawn out
in England of the conditions for peace, before ever any news came of this
great Statists censure) I said to a very friend of mine: that it would cost the
Jesuits a brace of a thousand pounds to stop it: for that it stood not with
father Parsons platform to have any relaxation of persecution in England, so
long as either her Majesty lived, or yet after, until he were ready to come
with Montioy Saint James of Spain, and Parsons for the Britons Monarchy,
because a tolleration for religion would breed these inconveniences (all making
against him and his faction.) First, he could not then have any color to set
out books, or anticke shows (as he has) or to blaze it abroad in all
nations, how cruel, tyrannical, and inhumane the persecution of Catholics is
in England. Secondly, he could no longer after have blown the infamous blasts
that course both sea and land, he affirming England to be the nurcery of
faction, sedition, and of all mischief wrought throughout the world, setting
all Princes, Monarchs and States together by the ears, living in league with
one to make war against another, and maintaining of rebels against their
Sovereigns. Thirdly, he could not by all likelihood have had any Catholic
Prince or other in Christendom to have banded on his side. For with what
color could either Spain or Austria, or any Catholic Prince have invaded
England, if Catholics might live here as freely as they did in France, or as
the Hugonites do now live there, and the Protestants in Germany, and the
Christians in Turkey, and the Mahumetanes in Tartary, and the Pagans in
Presbiter John's dominions. Fourthly, he could never after have gone forward
with this platform for aspiring to the Monarchy. For whereas now all
Catholics must depend upon the Archpriest, and the Archpriest upon father
Garnet, and Garnet upon Parsons, and Parsons upon the devil, (the author of all
rebellious conspiracies, treasons, murders, disobedience, heresies, and all
such other diabolical and bloody designements, as this wicked Jesuit has
hitherto devised) then and in that case this dependency had bin utterly void.
For we should have had Catholic Bishops as Suffragans or such like, that might
have given holy orders, consecrated holy oiles, ministered the Sacrament of
Confirmation, exercised their Episcopal authority in all things necessary,
privately: as it was in the Apostles time and Primitive Church, without either
any the least inco^brance or perturbance of the state, or present incumbents
(the Bishops and Archbishops that now are) or admittance of any seditious
Jesuit, or other factious person to come within the la^d. Fifthly, his malicious
devises, and cruel hard heart toward al Catholics had herby bin discovered: as
never able hereafter to have stirred up her Majesty, or incensed her honorable
Counsel against all her loyal and most dutiful subjects, for his
treacheries, treasons and co^spiracies. Because al in that case would have bin
ready to have revealed the least thought of any co^federacy against her royal
person, kingdom and state. Sixthly, his baits had been worth nothing for
enticing and alluring of any subject to rebellion (either for the time present,
or to come: because a league being once made with the French and Spanish
nation: all Catholics of England being withal naturally inclined to love and
loyalty of and to their Prince and country, all promises or hopes of
preferment under foreign Princes, would have bin and seemed hateful,
ridiculous and senseless unto them. No nation under heaven affording greater
honors, comforts and content then England, and our Sovereigns both are able
and do afford to the inhabitants that live in grace and favor: as in this case
(vtcunque) the afflicted Catholics should. Seventhly, this tolleration or
liberty of conscience, would quite have cut off two bloody hopes, which Parsons
has in all his practices: to wit, as well the inda^gering of her Majesty's royal
person, as also the favoring, furthering, co^senting, or any way seeking
directly or indirectly the advancement of any one competitor more the^ another:
otherwise then they should have perceived her Highness and the present state to
have favored and like of. For howsoever the seculars, and many other sound
Catholics do detest to death the said practices, and would be as ready as any to
dye at her Majesty's feet, in defense of her royal person, and (even in the
afflicted state they live in) to reveal any such unnatural and monstrous
conspiracies: yet all are not of that humor (though perhaps as good Catholics
and loyal subjects in another sense as the former are) in that knowing
themselves most innocent of all state-medlings, or practices whatsoever, they
are notwithstanding nothing for that more favored. And therefore nature
inclining all men living to seek for ease, quiet, security and auoidance of
troubles, dangers, afflictions and miseries: although they abhor, and would
never to death be actors in such conspiracies: yet their wits being occupied
with co^ceits of the premises, makes many one wish in their heart for a change:
never thinking, considering nor regarding which way, nor by what means soever.
And then when this general desire of living quiet and free in all, is sorted
with an inconsiderate conceit in many, a vehement motion of revenge working in
some, makes the^ ready to attempt what desperate act soever, ad iniustam
vexationem redimendam. And so to follow any abettor, complottor, pretendor or
co^spirator. Which father Parsons well noting, and how that by liberty of
conscience, all such conceits would vanish away, and so frustrate his hope for
ever, egging, suggesting, or setting on any even to have the least wish or
thought of alteration or change: no marvel though he cannot abide to hear of
any league or liberty. Eighthly, his chief hope being to procure a new formal
excommunication against all that shall not join with Spain, or the Lady
Infanta, when bloody Bellona shall once hang forth her slag of defiance within
an English Ken in the streamers of her menaces: by this foresaid liberty
granted, his butcherie, sacriligious and irregular hope, were not only
frustrate in this, but also all former excommunications, suspensions and
Ecclesiastical censures, that have erst passed against our Sovereign, by his
seditious procurement, would be repealed, revoked, called in, and made void to
all intents and purposes, that might any way prejudice her Majesty or the
present State. Therefore stands it the Jesuitical faction upon, to hinder all
peace, liberty of conscience, tolleration, or what else soever other gracious
conniuence would be granted either for security of her Realm and royal
State, or otherwise for the safety of her worne-out loyal subjects, still
afflicted upon the jealousy (I cannot say but justly) had of all that faction
for these unnatural proceedings. Ninthly, the great sums of money, which the
no less consciencelesse then merciless Jesuits collect over all the Realm,
by cousinage of many a virtuous innocent, and well meaning Catholic, would by
this means be better employed to the relief of the poor distressed, both
Priests and other Catholics, that now famish and pine away for want of food,
through these cruel Jewish stony hearts restraint of all relief from them:
and further he should not have such large gifts to bestow in bribes upon the
brokers of his trecheries, slanders and calumniations: nor by consequent so
many to take his part, as now he has, if present gain, and promise of future
preferment did not set headie careless peoples teeth on edge, as both do:
which would easily be avoided, if these extremities men are driven into, by
reason of imprisonment, and other vexations for their conscience were taken
away. Tenthly, his popular government would by this means be made void, by
reason that all men, seeing him to have been the cause of their former
troubles, persecutions and miseries, they would be in that case as forward to
thrust out, reject, and expel both him and all his seditious company and
confederates, as now they are to applaude unto them, or receive them. For such
is the nature of the mobile vulgus, most to respect their present quiet,
consolation and ease. Eleuenthly, by means of this tolleration, all plots and
conspiracies (whereof I am fully persuaded there are a great many yet lie
hidden and unknown) would come to light: the very conceit of this long wished
for liberty being a ready means to make many joyful hearts, even ready to
open their own unnatural wishes, much more the treacherous practices of any
other whosoever of their dearest friends: none next to God and their own
souls, being in this case so near unto them, as their Prince and country.
All these things well weighed, you see that Parsons (his vile bloody and
bastardly mind considered, Lo here my masters and mistresses, you that be so
hot spirited prosecutors of the Jesuitical faction, and so vehement against
the seculars: behold the grateful reward you are to look for at Fa. Parsons
hands: vaunt of him as you lift: as sure as you live on earth, he cares no
more for all your lives, then so many dogs lives, in time of an infectious
plague.
together with all his confederates) have great reason on the one side never to
death to yield to any peace, liberty of conscience, or the least gracious
conniuence, or princely favors to be granted by her Majesty to any Catholic.
This miserable wretch showing plain by these his lewd proceedings, that he
cares not: nay, questionless, he could wish in his heart, to see all the
seculars and other Catholics in England hanged, rather then to be frustrat of
his conceited Iaponia^ Monarchy. Yea I verily think he would be the hangma^ of
the^ al himself, rather the^ his platform should fail, if it stood upon so
desperate a point) one after another: as a fitter office for such a base
irregular bastard, then to come nere Gods holy altar, or once to touch those
tremenda mysteria, or to supply in any one thing the place and function of a
Priest. And on the other side you see again, what his ostentation is for
religion: and how zealous these cogging mates would make men believe they are
(right Puritanes in all things) envying that any should receive, yea but the
least favor at her Majesty's hands, which they have: nay they refusing to
receive any, unless they may have all. Well, it has been an ordinary matter,
when any notorious heresy did arise, that sundry contraries out of the same
did spring: and so I fear it will prove betwixt the Puritan Jesuits, and the
Puritan Ministers, unless some order be taken for them both in time, lest
they win so much time, as it will be past time to correct them in any time
hereafter. But to return again to Fa. Parsons practice for gaining time. You
see, how that notwithstanding his forwardness in show for the conversion of
his country: yet unless it may be said unto him withal, Divide and impera,
he will not hear of any smaller matter in public. And yet again underhand
and upon this ground of gaining time he labors continually for the setting
up now of this man, and now of that woman, furnishing of every one with such
bald stuff, as he has to make them believe, they have matter sufficient to
prove that the right of the Crown belongs unto them.

For notwithstanding all his fair weather to Spain: yet for winning of time,
he has still been practicing from time to time to have raised up others,
whilst the Spaniard was a breathing to have gotten the Kingdom if he could,
and so to have plucked that morsel out of King Philip and his daughters jaws,
nor caring who, nor of what race, nor of what nation soever, that would step in
for the Kingdom, so he were (forsooth) a Catholic. O good Lord yea a
Catholic he must be: so her Majesty were deposed he cares not by whom, but
yet must make show, that it must be by advancing some Catholic, otherwise he
could have no color of wishing for it: and much less any means either to
exasperate her Majesty and the present State against Catholics, or yet to
stir up Catholics with desire to redeem themselves out of the heavy
persecutions laid upon them. For as he dealt first by his Agents with the Earl
of Derby (and yet the said Earl was no Catholic) so at an other time he writ
a discourse, sent it into England, and it caused to be published to many of the
best Catholics here: which was, that he would wish, and did by those presents
advise them, when the commodity served, that they should make an election of
some principal Noble (and at last with much ado came out this word, Catholic)
to be their King. And all this was but a point of dalliance to gain time
withal. And still when no pretender nor people will be so mad as to follow
his designements, then has he ever his recourse to the King of Spain: and at
this time insisteth upon the Infanta: whose title, though in his Appendix
falsely fathered upon Cardinal Allane, he so approves in conceit, as not only
he is bold to call all men fools, malecontent (Atheists, and fautors of
heretics, that labor or wish, or but think that any other can have right)
being known an heretic, and no hope of reconciling them, as he says: but
besides, though Catholics, they all were yet by moth-eaten records found out
in an old wall, (God knows when, where, or by whom) he will exclude al King
Henry the seuenths issue: marry yet always provided, that if the Infanta
fail his expectation (as I pray God her Grace may fail it) then will he be
left free, and in the mean while also debarred from following of none that will
first take arms against our Sovereign Lady and Queen.

And thus the case is clear in answer to the interrogatorie, that absolutely
the Jesuits seek the conversion of no one of the blood Royal, but
conditionally only, and for winning of time, they seek for the conversion of
now one, and then another, as may for the time make most for their purpose. But
they never (as you may easily gather by the premises) seek to have all
Catholics, because that would make a general opposition against them, and be
an occasion to thrust them quite out of the land. So as to conclude this vain
vaunt of their religious zeal, perfection, and I know not what: is nothing
else but an elenchiall cloak to cover their pride, ambition, and treacherous
aspires.

THE IX. ARTICLE.
WHether then in that case intend they absolutely the advancement of those
conditionally converted by them, or only legatiuely: or as subordinate under
any: verbi gratia: as to be Viceroyes, or matched to some Alien, or home-borne
subjects, Viceroyes under the Spanish or Austrian Monarch?

THE ANSWER.
THey intend it only conditionally, subordinately, and legatiuely under
another. For it were no policy by their principles to have any one absolute
Monarch or Sovereign in esse over all England, to rule over them too: no more
then it were to have had an Archpriest that should have governed, and have been
head over the Jesuits as well as the seculars. Therefore as they got such a
fellow for the nonce to be Archpriest, as both they might govern as they list
themselves, and make him fare like a Turk, tinker or mad man at their
pleasure, to torment poor souls, the ignorant devout laity with scruples:
the wiser sort with infamous libels, schedules, gallings, letters and messages
of slanders: and all both men and women, clergy and laity, with threats,
thunderings and fears, that would not obey a paltrey Jesuit, and to be ready
to crouch, bow, and kneel at an inch, a nod or a frown to these new Pharisees:
so of very like quality, condition, and order must be their Viceroy and his
government. For all this banding on the Archpriests behalf, was only (you see)
those vile patches hypocrisy: under pretense of a legatiue and subordinate
power and authority under his Holiness, whom they most abusiuely, impudently,
and (in the intended platform) scoffingly make the mask, cloud and cloak,
under which they hide the never heard of more impiety. And like a company of
swaggerers, ruffians, or bragging braggats of Toledo, they take upon them to
defend the Archpriest in all his actions, under color of obedience: with, o I
will, yea that I will stand to death in defense of this due obedience, to the Sea of his Holiness, (for to defend him, say they, is to defend the Pope
himself:) which might carry some sense, if they acknowledged him also to be
their superior. But seeing they acknowledge no such matter, nay quite
contrary, that he stands at their devotion, and is but like an Ape, a Parrot,
or a Vice in a play, to prate what is prompted or suggested unto him: or like
an axe, a saw, a sword, or other dead instrument that moves and works all
things, intention rationalis agentis, (for he has no wit nor discretion to do
any thing, as it seems, but as their Provincial instructs him) therefore
what is this else to say, vz. whosoever is disobedient to the Archpriest is
disobedient to the Pope: then to maintain that, whosoever is not obedient to a
Jesuit in any thing, reus est of disobedience unto the Pope in all things: for
he that offends in one, offends in all. And so by consequent in this
subordinate authority, these corollaries follow one upon another in this
manner: the Archpriest must rule all other Priests: the Jesuits must rule the
Archpriest: the Pope must appoint whom, and as they list: the disobedience to
the party appointed must be holden for a contempt of his Holiness: the action
goes under the name of Schism and irregularitie: the Court of Oyer and
terminer, must be in the Low countries under Archduke Albert: the
Commissioners, Jury and Judges must be the Jesuits: the apeale to the Pope
from them must be excommunication, suspension and loss of all faculties and
authority: and so Parsons as summus Pontifex, or Judge Paramount on earth,
under the Devil in hell: must denounce the sentence following, out from his
infernal seat.

Forasmuch as the secular Priests durst presume to appeal to Saint Peter's
chair against my faithful servant George Blackwell, instituted at my
appointment, designements and instructions given to the Pope of Rome, to make
him Archpresbiter, and Protonotharius, etc. in and throughout the great
Kingdoms of Albion or great Britain, ( to do law and justice upon such
rebels, against my loving brother the King Catholic of Spain, as in that
Imperial Isle it should seem, meet, just and necessary in his wisdom to
have sharply rebuked, chastised and punished,) and for that also I did
prescribe the manner, how the said Pope was to proceed according to the tenure
of my abstract of statutes, laws, orders and acts, enacted by me and my
General in the high Council of Reformation for England: with a prouiso, that
my forenamed servant Master Blackwell should have nothing to do with the
fathers of the society. I thought it meet in my experience and wisdom, not
only to exempt all my brethren and confatherhoods the Jesuits in England,
Scotland or elsewhere, from being under the Archpriest: but moreover and
besides to will and command my said servant Master Blackwell, under pain of
officipard to do nothing without my Provincial Garnets counsel, designements
and decrees: who being an especial illuminate, and having a more near
familiarity with God then any of the rest, by reason of his place and calling:
he the said Blackwell thus directed by him, shall be so far and free from
error, or doing any thing amiss in acting all things under obedience to my
Provincial, as whosoever should contradict any thing by him decreed, I hold it
sit that he be noted for an Ethnicke, a reprobate, and one that was never
established in the grace of God, etc.

All these laws, statutes and acts (with prouisoes) thus enacted: forasmuch as
the seculars contemptuously, have violated, infringed and broken, the very
marrow, center and quintessence of their contempt, accrewing to the prejudice
of the holy society, and therein to Father Parsons in chief, it stood his
Provincial Garnet upon, to lay about him on the behalf of Blackwell, to make
his cause and quarrel his own: and this to be outwardly in show Clement the
eighth, his Holiness the Pope of Romes, in managing and menacing: and inwardly
in intention, to be Parsons that bastardly vicar of hell: his in the platform,
plotcastings and practices. And so for all the world never imagine nor dream
of any kind of temporal government by a Puritan Jesuit, to be otherwise
intended: then as a Puritan Minister said in Edenborough, God and the Kirk
against the King and his Council: and outher, ney King or ney Minister in
Scotland. As much to say, and as Knoxe that seditious traitor did write to her
Majesty: that those Princes who will not subject themselves to their infernal
and damnable discipline, yea and submit themselves to be ruled by the
Puritanian Ministry, might justly and should be deposed and deprived both of
Crown, government and life at their pleasure. Wherein you may please to note
by the way, that the Puritanian Ministers made the Gospel, and the black
Kirk of Scotland, their pretense for aduauncing such a man to the Crown, as
should wholly subject himself, and swear and subscribe to the defense of
their doctrine. And yet all the world knows it, that they would bring all
into a Swisserly popularitie, or a Geneuian government, void of Prince, peer
or other Noble: or at least will never yield to accept of any King, that shall
not be ruled by the^. And even so the Puritanian Jesuits must needs intend and
do make show of advancing none to the English Crown, but such a one as is
converted to the Catholic Church of Rome, making the Gospel and spouse of
Christ their pretense therein. But yet their platform allows no King power or
potentate above them: and by consequent, seeing notwithstanding yet needs they
must have the countenance of some great Monarch for a time to govern by, in
the state temporal (as now they make his Holiness for a while their sconce
and buckler in the state ecclesiastical,) it were no policy in them to have
an absolute Sovereign to reign in this land: (no not even the Infanta, who
questionless Parsons made choice of before her father or brother the King, of
purpose to have her government subordinate either under him or the Emperor:)
but as they have gotten an Archpriest to be as it were a Vicar general
subordinate under his Holiness in causes Ecclesiastical, and yet his said
Holiness only to be a shadow or cloak, but to have no medlings or dealings,
nor to know any thing of the affairs of his Church here, further then they
shall please to inform him of: so will they never admit of other government,
but a Viceroy to be as it were a Prorex, or King homage^ subordinate to Spain
or Austria in causes temporal. And yet the said Prorex must stand at their
devotion, and not be able to inform any thing to the King absolute, further,
or otherwise then as they shall appoint him: which if he do or attempt the
contrary, he is sure to be deposed, and loose his life for it: and either such
a new King homager chosen by the Prince absolute at their assignement, or else
no King ever after, but a king Cardinal, and Pope Jesuit.

THE X. ARTICLE.
Whether then is it dangerous or not, to have any of the English blood royal
either married to one of the Jesuitical or Spanish faction, (which I perceive
is all one in the general pretense, though not in the intention or practice)
either within or without the land: or otherwise converted to the Catholic
faith (if God so give them grace) by any Jesuit or Iesuited Priest of their
faction?

THE ANSWER.
THe danger you make a question of, may be two ways taken: one spiritually,
and the other corporally. In neither of which dangers, any one can be said
properly and directly to be, in the act of either marriage or conversion.
Because (as I said at the first) these seditious, turbulent, factious Jesuits
here in England, howsoever they may be in foro conscientiae and before God,
excommunicated, suspended, irregular, or otherwi^e have incurred any
ecclesiastical censure by their absurd, gross, erroneous opinions, practices
and proceedings: yet for that they live hitherto as visible members of the
Catholic Church, and neither do, neither dare publicly teach, much less
obstinately defend any thing contrary to the Catholic Churches doctrine and
belief: and further, forasmuch as there is no sentence as yet denounced, from
his Holiness against them, or if denounced, yet not here made known: or if
known, yet no Bull nor Brief come for assurance thereof: or if any such, yet
not publicly promulgated: therefore in foro externo (all these circumstances
considered, and that the Church does judge, secundum allegata and probata) as
they must be had and known, before any danger can come to those that go to
confession to the^, or any other sacraments administered by them: so all the
world may see their diabolical malice, malicious spite, and most spiteful
calumniation, wrong and injury offered to the seculars, that without any one
of these circumstances, they have like devils, (not men) presumed to torment
devout souls with terrors, scruples and fears, in coming at any sacraments
with those that are opposite to their cursed designements. Now for intended
marriage, they do no question wish it for their own advantage, and so for the
time there can be no danger to the person on their side. Marry now because
that both in the one and the other, scil. conversion and marriage, their
intention is treasonable and heretical (as by all which has been or shall be
said may easily appear,) therefore is there no less danger to any of the
blood royal to deal with them, then the loss of honor, life, body, soul
and all they have or may be worth: their pretense of zeal in converting souls
to Gods Church, and of marriage, practice, and in wish of this or that match,
being nothing else but parasiticall flattering, cousining of those that they
deal withal: intending principally and all wholly, to stead their own turns
thereby, making fair show, as though they wished it most by such, as for the
time present are likeliest to prevail: but not caring in very deed how, nor
by whom it come, so as they may be sticklers in it, and be either the Pilot or
the masters Mate to guide the stern which way as they think best. And by
consequent it appears, that they make no more store of a man or woman's life,
Lord or Lady, King or Queen, then they do of the life or death of a dog or a
mouse: as you may find by sundry examples here set down of casting off or
tormenting those that were not for their tooth: notwithstanding all former
courtesies, benefits, or credit gotten by them. So as to conclude this last
Article of their plots by government, I hold him or her whosoever that subjects
themselves to live under their thraldom, to be cast away for ever in this
life, howsoever it fare with them in the world to come.

THE ARGUMENT OF THE sixth General Quodlibet.
COnformably to this Quodlibet of Government, does comply another general
Quodlibet of Authority And therefore as the Jesuits Plots and practices are
discovered in their platform for intended government in time to come: so is it
necessary to speak something of their pretended authority, said to be in
Master George Blackwell their superintendent or Archpriest for the time
present. Concerning which general point, there are these ten interrogatorie
Articles following to be canuassed.

THE SIXTH GENERAL QVODlibet, of Plots by Authority
THE I. ARTICLE.
WHether the Archpriests authority be over both seculars and Jesuits equally,
or only over seculars: and if over them only, then why it was so instituted,
and by whom obtained?

THE ANSWER.
THis Article is touched before in effect to all that here is necessary to be
said of it: to wit: that the Archpriest his authority is far from any
equality or copercenarie dealing with the Jesuits equally, as with the
seculars: Note a notable stratagem in Par. who made it seem at first, as though
the Archpriest should have had nothing to do with the l^^tie. Then afterward:
that his authority was only for ending of surmized strife betwixt the
seculars and the laiti^: after that again, his autho^itie extended to
excommunicating, interdicting, etc. all alike either clergy or laity: and
lastly, a show was made outw^^^, that the Ies^^^^ also were under his
autho^^tie.
that he neither has any thing to do with any Jesuit as a superior, no nor
as an equal companion with them: neither may he, neither dare he show any
favor to whom they dislike of, neither do nor speak, but as they will have
him. Whereupon it is by demonstration manifest, that the appointment and cause
of his election and institution, proceeded all wholly from the Jesuits: and was
the most vile, presumptuous and injurious part of Parsons that ever was heard
of since the world began: as by all the books that are, and will be set out
against that Atheall stratagemitor, will at large appear. Only for the
present this Article is necessary to be proposed and answered for satisfying
of the ignorant multitude: amongst whom these cousining mates the Jesuits make
it to be given out, as though the Archpriest were the head over all Catholics
both Clergy and laity, spiritual and temporal, secular and religious: which
is nothing else but a cogging device in them to build thereupon these false
assertions following for blinding and deluding of the simple, scil. First, that
now all is well we having an Archpriest, that as our head is an indifferent man
for all, as well seculars as Jesuits. Secondly, that the seculars are only
those that make sedition and strife, not living orderly as they should under
obedience to the Archpriest their superior. Thirdy, that the Jesuits live
contented and quiet under his government, though he be a secular Priest only
for obedience. Fourthly, that there being no difference betwixt the seculars
and Jesuits in the Archpriests authority, he being equally appointed over them
both, it is a bad sign in the seculars that should seem to find fault with
his government more then the other. Fifthly, that the seculars show no religion
in them, but live as profane schismatikes, in withdrawing their obedience from
their superior more then the Jesuits do. Sixthly, that the Jesuits show
themselves to be marvelous zealous, wise, learned and religious: in standing
to the Archpriest, as they do against the seculars. Seventhly, that no good or
sound Catholic would ever have made any question of his authority: now that
it is gotten, though he were partial to one more then another. Eighthly, that
an authority being once granted, how impious, unjust, and unlawful soever,
yet it ought to be obeyed in all things and of all those under it to the
uttermost, without any question to be made of it ever after: and as unlawful
to appeal from the one as from the other. Ninthly, that the Archpriest may
excommunicate, suspend, interdict, etc. when he list notwithstanding the
appeal, and even for making an appeal from him to the Sea of Rome. Tenthly,
that the seculars committed a most horrible crime, sin or offense in
appealing: and showed themselves to be disobedient to the catholic Church and
the Pope in disobeying the Archpriest therein: he having commanded that there
should be no writing nor sending over beyond the seas, nor meetings here, nor
talk had about any such matters. 11. That they are a seditious, unlearned and
irreverent company: for making no more reckning of the fathers then they do,
and are rightly called a faction for opposing them selves against so holy,
virtuous and religious men, that are their betters, and superiors in all things
as the Jesuits are: who have done so many good deeds as the saculars never did
nor can do the like. Twelftly, that no man or woman ought or may come at the^,
to receive any Sacrament, as having lost al their faculties and authority by
their disobedience and contempt of their superior. Thirteenthly, that they have
justly deserved to be evil spoken of, and to have no relief until they
submit themselves and recall their names from the appeal. 14. That it were no
more offense to kill one of them, then to kill a notorious persecutor and
heretic. Fifteenthly, that the words Christ spoke when he said, whosoever will
not obey the Church, let him be accounted of, as a Publica^ or Ethnicke and
infidel, did aptly agree to the seculars to be so accounted of, for disobeying
the Catholic Church by their appeal and other seditious and slanderous libels
against their superiors. These and many the like false suggestio^s (which no
Jesuit living dare for his life defend) are put into peopls heads of purpose,
to color therewith that bastard Pa. his impiety: whereby seeking to bind al unto
him with the band of obedience, he sets all his Iesuitical brokers here in
England and elsewhere on work, like so many band-dogs, with bands of men,
banding out his mischievous practices to bring all the whole realm bound hand
and foot into bondage under him.

THE II. ARTICLE.
WHether any treason, praemunire or other prejudice to the Sea Apostolic, the
Catholic Church, or Englands common wealth, be incurred by the institution of
this new authority, or none at all?

THE ANSWER.
ALL three are incurred to all estates in the highest degree, scil. both
treason committed against the Church of God, and commonwealth of this land:
both a praemunire incurred by ancient and recent laws against sacred Majesty,
both, (yea, all) prejudiced, scil. Pope, Prince, Church, commonwealth and
present state by master Blackwels authority: as is evident by sundry books
written, and to be written of every one of these points in particular, and may
be gathered passant in these Quodlibets here and there of all three. And first,
for treason: (which in Latin we call proditio or laesa maiestas, and a
triritor, traditor, vel proditor, vel reus lesae maiestatis. It is always an
act acted: or but only intended against supreme Majesty. Which here we take
three manner of ways, to wit, either against the Majesty Divine, and so all
mortal sins whatsoever, are so many treasons committed against the Majesty
of God: or otherwise against the reverend Majesty of his sweet spouse: and so
all Schism, heresy, Apostacy, and Atheism is treason against the Catholic
Church and supreme head thereof under Christ on earth: or lastly, against the
sacred Majesty of regal power: and so every act, attempt, or intent, etc. to
the indangering of the Princes person or commonwealth, is directly treason: and
by consequent, the justification of the Archpresbiterie, being only and wholly
by Father Parsons procurement, for the speedier, nay the only way and means to
perfect his most traitorous platform, tending to the dishonor of God,
prejudice of the Church, destruction of her Majesty, and ruin of the
commonwealth: (as in the Quodlibet of statizing shall be proved.) It is clear
then that this institutiue authority of Blackwels, contains in it a whole
mass of treason and conspiracy: and the like is of a praemunire (made by
Catholic Princes, Kings of this land, and allowed of by the Sea Apostolic)
incurred thereby. Whereof besides that which has been and shall be said here
thereof, you may please to read M. Charles Pagets book against counterfeited
Doleman, alias Parsons, and other books written against him and his associates.

THE III. ARTICLE.
Whether the institution of the Archpriest, be equally prejudicial to the
Commonwealth of Scotland and King James, as it is to England and our
Sovereign: or not so faulty?

THE ANSWER.
IT is equally at least, and may in many respects be judged more prejudicial to
the Scottish King and Commonwealth, then to our Sovereign: because the
institutor Par. had before written his book of Titles or succession in most
apparent prejudice, and ignominious slander of the said King, very sawcily and
rudely abasing both his royal Majesty and his whole Realm: and therefore too
too vile a part and an act of most indignity, for him so officiously to
institute an English man to be in so great authority within his highness
dominions. Secondly, the Scots Catholics had, and have yet their Bishop of
Glasco living, a very reverend Prelat: ergo a more saucy part to appoint over
them a superior above him. Thirdly, there was not one secular Priest at the
institution of this authority in all Scotland, save only the Abbot of New Abbey,
all the rest being Jesuits that were or are there: ergo a greater presumptuous
boldness in him to appoint such an authority there. Fourthly, he lying still
at London, and neither having any acquaintance in Scotland, neither sending any
other thither to labor in Christ his vineyard: it seems to be a male part
kind of bearding out their King, Nobles, Gentles, and Leards of that land
rather then any thing else: considering that he neither coms neither sends over
thither. Fifthly, Fa. Par. platform holding equally for Scotl. as well as Engl.
the authority limited to M. Blackwell over both nations, bewraies the
Jesuitical ambitious humor and traitorous intent, more then any other action
ever did before.

THE IIII. ARTICLE.
Whether was it any sin, Schism, or other offense, not to have admitted of
the Archpriest, upon Cardinal Caietanes bare word or writing, before the Bull
came from the Pope: or whether might the seculars, or ought they in conscience,
equity and policy have accepted of him or not?

THE ANSWER.
IT was no offense at all then to have resisted (as by sundry books written
hereof it is manifest) no more then it is now to appeal from him: but quite
contrary, it was an act of justice.

1 His election was without our consent, knowledge, or acceptance.

2 It was not made palam, sed fraudulenter, secreto and animo decipiendi,, as
may be proved: Capite contra Canones: and videat, and casus excommunicationis
in huius, etc.

3 No example of the Apostles actions, neither yet of any Infidels conversion
can free them from the decretum of the order observed in all elections: because
our country had from the beginning of these new heresies, sundry Prelates
with the laity, qui nunquam genu flexerunt coram Baal, etc being continually
ex part Catholica: therefore whatsoever does bind for elections in other
Catholic countries, binds here etc. Ergo Blackwellus contra Canones, etc.

4 No law, humane, divine, of nature or nations allows a forced governor
intruded especially to tyrannize (as his authority by the words in his Brief,
corrigere, castigare, etc. is none other) and not a word spoken of charity,
equity, or justice.

5 It is opposite to all order in heaven and earth: a Michael chosen as head of
the principates, quia vnus ex illis: and not a Raphael of another order, etc.
And as the Chapter of Cannons choose their Deane and not the Priests dispearsed
in parishes: the Deane, Chapter and Priests of each Bishoprike their Bishop:
and not the inclused Monks of that Dioces, the Dominicans their Prior: and not
the Franciscans: the Jesuits their prouincial, and not the Benedictines: the
Aldermen and City of London their Mayor, and not the Justices, etc. and only
in hell and amongst heretics, ordo negligitur: ergo the Jesuits appointing us
a superior do imitate one of these.

6 His letters to Rome against his brethren, and egor defense of the Jesuits,
convince him to be, vnus ex, vel subditus illis: ergo co^tra ius imponitur
nobis, etc.

7 He publicly professes partiality: as in his bitter letters to master
Benson, to master More, and to sundry others: and that he maintains them in
all things: ergo vt iniquus and iniustus iudex deponendus.

8 His authority was unhonestly procured: because we were never made acquainted
therewith, having e contrario formerly imparted our minds unto them, etc.
unlawfully confirmed: because by the Cardinal at Parsons suite (both our
enemies) and unjustly executed: because by Judges of their own cause: and
therefore all three, Cardinal, Parsons and Blackwell, intrusers into our
harvest, usurpers of his Holiness authority, and tyrants over us and our
country.

9 That it was directly a plot cast of Parsons by and for the Jesuits to expel
or bring all Priests under them: patet ex bulla, qua instituitur praecipue, vt
pacem habeant cum Iesuitis: ergo ad interitum omnium aliorum, etc.

10 That it was foisted in by Parsons procurement only, upon a point of
extremity to color his impiety: and to stop the discovery of his treacherous
mind toward his country appears: For it came iumpe at that time when both
in Spain, Italy and the Low Countries, his dealings began to be odious for his
tyranny against all Priests and lay persons, that consented not to his
Iaponian kingdom: and in England his books, and all his and their dealings,
being by Catholics generally disliked, and by secular Priests condemned and
rejected, as full of ambition, bloodshed, infamy and ruin, intended to our
whole country: it was time to set up such an Archiprate, or else had the
Jesuits faction been quite pulled down for ever: which though he have but a
blind name of authority: yet it serves to hold tacke, till by invasion or
otherwise the Jesuits may work their feate, for inhauncing of kingdoms, etc,
ergo utterly by all English to be dejected.

11 That setting M. Black, private life aside (which now I omit) he is unfit
(if such authority were lawfully granted) to be chosen for a head over so great
a multitude of fine wits, and many more grave, ancient and learned then
himself: especially in times of so many dangers, and full of diversities and
differences in all things (besides religion and learning:) and this is most
plain, for that he is well known to be a man of no reach: only he has read
and studied sundry positive authors, whereby he can speak or write sentences,
evil couched together (God wot) out of others. But of himself, he never knew
what discourse, writing to great persons, or of matters of weight, or what
civil conversation or government meant. For having a charge only of a widow
Gentlewoman with whom he lived, he never conuersed with any to learn either
wit, knowledge, or experience in any thing: or how to behave himself in
company, discourse, or otherwise, to sift out any matter, or yet to know how to
do justice in his office, further then his book told him, which often causes
error through want of practice and experience to know the custom of times and
places, etc. which may alter quite his book cases, as applied by a
correspondencie to another purpose. Which gross ignorance a man shall find
almost in every letter he writes: wresting this and that sentence, Canon,
author and authority, quite contrary, to another act, matter, sense and
meaning then ever thereby was intended: which I should rather think came of
his simplicity, then of wilful error: were it not that he is become so proud,
peremptory, and scoffing, contemptuous in his exorbitant letters, words, and
all his other actions, since this immerited authority came upon him: ergo by
Parsons rule of deposing or choosing governors, M. Blackwell is unfittest of an
hundred: and consequently to be deposed for his insufficiency, though
otherwise he had absolute authority.

12 That M. Blackwels simplicity and unaptness to govern, shows plain the
great mischief and ruin of our country intended by choosing of him, is
manifest. For who in policy would attempt that which the Jesuits go about,
by any but such, as wanting wit to enter into their drift, should think every
word to be an oracle, or else to be the Gospel that they speak: and then upon
this ground, Catholics having tender consciences, must think it a sin
irremissible to resist, etc.

13 That the Jesuits policy was marvelous dexterous, in choosing one by
profession a secular Priest, and not a known Jesuit: and consequently none
fitter then M. Blackwell: vz. First, otherwise they had opened their own
ambition to all the world. Secondly, they could not in honesty, and with any
face have spoken for thems^lues, as others may do for them. Thirdly, they may
hereby color all their treachery: for if it fadge not well, the head is a
Seminary or secular Priest; if it hap to their wish, he is by them set up:
ergo at their appointment. Fourthly, they may (as they do) more stoutly defend
him, then themselves.

14 That a greater persecution is and must ensue by M. Blackwels
Archpresbitery, then ever came to Catholics by the civil magistrates: vz.
First, for that it opens the way to all rebellion, freeing every one to speak
or do what they list, or can, against any except Jesuits: and all under
pretense of zeal, in taking (forsooth) the Popes part, by defending M.
Blackwels authority: and esteeming of all that resist it, to be Schismatics or
worse. Secondly, whereas before some few were infamed by private oppositions
against the Jesuits: now all that obey not M. Blackwell, are so persecuted by
these Parsonians railing and slaundering toungs, as none can live free.
Thirdly, it breeds that contempt, as every boy and girl are in manner of
esteem of priesthood, become Haywoodists, Wisemanists, and (I could tell you
what worse perdee) to put no difference, but all secular as well laity as
clergy, etc. Fourthly, it makes vent for invasion both of England and
Scotland, the Archpriests twelve assistants being dispersed in every corner
with the laity, to work by North and by South, persuading it to be for the
Scots good to join with Spain: ergo, mightily he is to be resisted.

15 That the plot was laid long ago for the Archpriest, videl. by their olim
dicebamur and other forgeries of theirs. First, to breed commiseration of
Jesuits. Secondly, to make Seminaries and all secular priests odious to the
laity, as injurious detractors. Thirdly, to give scope by this, to defame whom
they would: (which were all that might seem to stand in their way) and this
done, then such defamed persons being unfit to govern, none but M. Blackwell
(supposing one must be chosen) could be found fit every way. A notable
stratageme: but altogether Atheall, diabolical, intolerable.

16 That all who defend the Archpriest, are either Jesuits, or do live under
and by them: or are now put in authority for them: or have the collections for
money throughout England: for Catholics to depend upon the^ or their
substitutes for the sacraments: or live in expectance of mountains at the
Spanish invasion by their procurement. All which, none that has seen and
known the state of things abroad, but may easily discern: and therefore of
all well wishing to their Prince and country, were these Parsonians with their
Archpriest to be resisted, and in no case ever to have yielded to his false
foysted-in authority.

17 The expostulations, manages and menaces of the Jesuits, in defense of M.
Blackwels authority, show plain how impiously, pharisaically and injuriously
they have dealt therein. First, for that they had at that time nothing to show,
but the Cardinals authorizing of him, who was known to be our adversary.
Secondly, they never could bring any testimony, but of their own company to
certify so much, as that the Pope ever heard of this man's choosing, or any
such matter: until they had cast M. Bishop and M. Charnocke in prison, and so
tyrannized like Turks over them. Thirdly, their excuse of a Popes Bull was
vain, that which they had being all one and the same, (if any thing worth) as
confirmed by the Pope, and a praemunire incurred as well by the one as the other,
as they have handled it. Fourthly, their pretense of the Cardinals fear, in
that he durst not grant it, without the Popes priuit e, is ridiculous and for
babies (as Parsons counts all the seculars) his answer being ready (if called
in question) that he appointed Blackwell only as a Prefect or some such one
amongst a multitude to keep good order, but no further: and not that, but as he
was informed, vz. that he was fittest to appease contentions, etc. Fifthly,
their comparison of the Cardinal, with a Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper, etc.
is simple and impertinent: for it only (if so much) holds in a Priest and a
Justice of peace, verbi gratia: the Lord Chancellor or other may appoint and
make a Justice of peace by his general authority given him by the Prince: but
to make a Lord President, or to create an Earl, or Lord Baron by that
authority, he cannot by any general grant: and therefore such being never,
or very rare heard of (as only one Earl of Chester had authority to create
Lord Barons, and never before nor since had any the like,) ergo the Cardinals
authority to give faculties to Priests, extends not to give a supreme
authority to any one Priest, more then himself had, or ever was known to be
in any of his predecessors, no not in Cardinal Allane, whom common sense tells
us should have had such authority in and over his own countrymen, sooner then
any other here amongst us. Sixthly, their color of charity, to have had us
yield for the time, until we had heard to the contrary: was and is but flat
hypocrisy, coggerie and malice in them, pitying of us, to bolster out their
own abusing of us all. For having by Parsons means (no doubt) labored by
impudent lies and threats to the uttermost, to stop all complaints, and put
in a demurre, until that bastard might hear hence, and get a like catalogue
of names to that which the Jesuits got before: their conscience then would
stretch those names or other means used for that Atheall purpose, to as
absolute a consent and acceptance of this usurper now, as the former did by
their cogging and the cousinage used herein. Seventhly, their excuse of no
ticket, nor testimony from the Pope, or other whom we might trust is nothing,
and but a ridiculous confirmation of it, which they take by the example of
Priests: for every one knows the faculties of Priests are general: ergo, need
no other testimony, but notice given by any, that there they had such
faculties: but this Archpresbiter is a particular thing never heard of before:
ergo, unjust, unlawful and most to be suspected, doubted of, resisted,
impugned, abrogated, abolished.

18 The peevishness, simplicity and unfitness of M. Blackwell, the ambition,
envy and Machiauellisme of his electors, and the ignorance, lightness and
even too too blindly ouerweened affection of the mobile vulgus being duly
considered, this Archpresbitery will be the bane of all England, if ever
accepted of, and established by general consent and applause. First, for that
his authority extends to all England, Scotland and (vt ait) Ireland, with many
agents in them all, ergo: once confirm it, and vpstarts the Iapon Monarchy.
Secondly, it derogates from all priestly authority: vz. by the liberty of
every Jack and Gill, to defame Priests without satisfaction: by calling lay
men to control seculars, and both to disgrace, and hear them disgraced: as M.
Blackwell ordinarily speaks not to any secular Priest, but must have some of
the laity to hear the case: by their general maxim, that they may and do
use laity to defame, control, and deiect Priests, they being not able to be
in all places, and at all times themselves: which they confirm by the general
examples of their free speech, had of all Priests, Monks, Friars, Bishops, and
the Pope himself. Thirdly, it arrogates all supreme authority to the Jesuits:
vz. by making it a sin most heinous, not to yield to them in all things or a
sign of heresy to think they may err: or malice and loosnesse of life, to
charge them with any fault. Fourthly, it is a plain testimony of no religion
in the Jesuits, but flat Atheism making religious piety, but only a matter
of mere policy, by sending forth trumpetters to sound out their and
Blackwels virtues: concluding thereby, neither them to be spoken of, nor him to
be refused, as fittest of all, etc. as though inherent justice depended upon
external signs of virtue. Thus once yield to them and their Archpriest, and
farewell all religion in England shortly after.

19 To confirm this withal, their malice and evil meaning toward Priests is
in nothing more plain, then managing out that vsurpate Archpriest: vz. by
their ostentation of a most horrible sin to resist his authority: ergo we
are (by their detraction) al fools, ignorant, indiscreet, profane, unlearned,
consciencelesse, proud, malicious, infamous detractors, etc. and yet by the
same acts, they on the contrary are all wise, learned, of high prudence, of
special good carriage, virtuous and zealous, etc: o notable hypocrites: the old
Grammar rule is fitly applied unto you: scil. hypocrita cupit se videri iustus,
hypocrita cupit se videri iustum: a Jesuit iustus, must make a Blackwell
iustum.

20 The causes moving them thus vehemently to have urged our consent at the
first, and their now surcease from calling this vsurpate authority in question,
must needs be these. First, their shameful abuses, which would be called upon,
and sure to come coram nobis in the highest place: if once we had an equal
judge, as we doubt not but at length to have. Secondly, their cruelty used
toward all Priests. Thirdly, their dishonest proceedings in this election and
institution of master Blackwell. Fourthly, their unlawful authorizing of him
at the first without commission, banding it out like a company of cutters of
Queen hith, or roisters of Bellingsgate without all modesty, shamefastness
or honesty. Fifthly, their forging, facing and coining of letters messages,
etc. to get consents, etc. Sixthly, the general esteem simple people have of
their phansaicall virtue, honesty, and sincerity: so as yield our consents, we
occasionate their sin to increase: hold back our yield, and their impiety
is straight known, and they quite overthrown, dismasqu^d, deciphered, and set
forth in their proper colors.

21 We cannot in conscience yield to it, because that it is, first, to yield to
the slander raised by them of us all. Secondly, an injury to those that are
gone. Thirdly, a contradiction to our own doings. Fourthly, an opposition
against one and other. Fifthly, a breach of all order. Sixthly, a participation,
consent, association, combination, or sodalitie with the Jesuits to overthrow
our country, and make all our posterity curse us.

22 That M. Blackwell is but a cipher for the Jesuits, to put what figure they
list unto, vz. by the additions and substractions, affirmations, and negations,
etc. of the particulars of his authority: ergo part the figure, and the cipher:
and the best is, but tittle est, etc.

23 That they have indiscretely marred their own market, in their violent
course taken for confirmation of his authority. viz. First, by giving out such
and such to be excommunicated, suspended, etc. which he dare not auerre: nor
can obtain authority to do so. Secondly, by constituting assistants before
ever he had authority for himself: to whom he could not give any faculties,
they having come to London some of them three sundry terms for such: and he
answering still, that his authority for that matter was not yet come. Thirdly,
the authority that now his assistants have, is only nomine non re: for they
have to do with nothing, but as informers to give intelligence what they hear
and see. Fourthly, the Jesuits laity refusing to come at our Service, to
receive us into their houses: or to give us any maintenance: and giving out
that we are schismatikes, etc. for not accepting this cogging authority at the
first blast: show master Blackwell to be most greedy in affecting of honor,
that could not have patience until we had heard an answer from them we sent:
and the Jesuits to be most impudent in their dealings, that would Turkize over
us in that shameless manner, to urge our consent by violent force, not only
to save their credits which had been more tolerable: but withal to bolster
out their impiety, and most vile practices against us: and both to be void of
conscience, shame, religion or honesty, to have set a work abroach which to
maintain they must needs be desperate, or else are quite overthrown and
disgraced for ever.

24 This simple man's election now confirmed: the Jesuits being his counselors,
and all things working and drawing to a head for invasion, so as the plots are
like to be discovered shortly throughout Christendom, it stands these statists
upon to urge dentibus and ensibus for master Blackwell, whom if we yield unto,
we set up the Iaponian kingdom: if we resist we save our country: and overthrow
the^ for ever: ergo ^o true English hearted catholic ought to favor Blackwels
authority. And for any other unless it be the Puritanes, I think none will
hereafter, howsoever some schismatikes, and perhaps Protestants have heretofore
bin tempted with their fair promises. Many I verily think, that al Puritanes
will join wholly with the Jesuits at length (how far off so ever they seem
to be, and are yet in external profession of religion) there being at the least
half an hundredth principles, and odd tricks concerning government,
authority, tyranny, popularity, treason, co^spiracy, etc. which they iump as
just together in, as if both were made of one mould.

25 The very word Archpresbiter is Anomolum abolendum, quite out of use in Gods
Church at this day: ergo an innovation, never like to be allowed of by the
Pope, after his Holiness shall once please to be rightly informed of the case.

26 It was but a policy of Par. to give such a silly man a poor tittle,
without an ^ffectual title, to bleare our eyes with his care of our country:
because (forsooth) the name of a Bishop would have raised persecution: as
though this be not as great and greater cause of persecution. But the reason
was (indeed.) First, for that neither the Cardinal nor he could compass such
a matter, without authorizing such over the Jesuits equally with the seculars.
Secondly, for that the Pope must then have been both privy unto it, and
ratified and confirmed it. Thirdly, and most of all, for that then he must have
come by ordinary election of the seculars: whereas now being an extrauagant
innouate authority, this extraordinary choice of him does carry some better
show in it. Fourthly, this great Island could not then have been governed
absoultely by them, as is intended it shall be: by excluding all Bishops and
other authority.

27 It is just agreeing with the Puritanes to have this kind of Archpresbitery:
and Parsons private rules of government in his high Council of Reformation,
tend to no less in moral matters: though in religion he yet braues it out, as
though the most zealous Catholics sided on his side.

28 It was of purpose to keep all government from amongst us, thereby to
settle his Iaponian monarchy: ergo to be resisted.

29 It is contrary to the custom of all countries, ages, times and persons to
have such an Archpresbiteriall government: ergo, etc.

30 It was intended thereby to bring all by solemn oath, to prosecute the
Jesuits wicked designements: and therefore were certain Priests in Spain of
late urged to take an oath of obedience to the Archpriest in all things, at
their coming into England, notwithstanding the poor Archpriest stands still
at the Jesuits devotion, to be cast out at their pleasure, if he act not what
they command him.

31 It was invented of policy: sent over with unnatural hate toward our
country: and will be maintained with great bloodshed if not prevented: ergo.

These things being all matters of most weight (the circumstances on all sides
considered) that in a world can be found, I conclude with a brief answer, to
the Article proposed (after so many reasons in confirmation of what I speak)
with that most famous University of Paris (which spite of their malice has a
better authority to define of such matters then any Jesuit has) deciding the
case to be clear: that the seculars committed neither schism nor sin in
resisting, or (but only indeed) not consenting at the first to the Archpriests
authority. For to say troth, they resisted him in nothing: but only of desire
to be satisfied, sent to Rome, living in the mean while, without willing
offense given to him or any of his. And yet the peevish fellow could not be
quiet to suffer the^ to wink at him, unless they either put out both their
eyes, or stared him full in the face. So hard a matter it is to stay the
impotent violence of an ambitious heart, where it comes to be in any conceit,
of never before co^ceited Sovereignty. And so by consequent, seeing they never
might, nor ought to have accepted of him to govern them, (who knew not how to
govern himself) it was an act of justice in the secular Priests, and al
others to resist his cousining, foisted in, banded, intruded, vsurpate,
tyrannical, unnatural, Atheall, barbarous, mock authority.

THE V. ARTICLE.
WHether seeing by the precedent Articles the chief danger for the present
incurred by the Archpriest came to Catholics by this occasion, scil. that it
was procured from the Pope, Sea, and Court of Rome: and that by a Bull, and in
such manner, as not only a praemunire was incurred thereby by ancient laws of
this land, as before I said: but also and much more by recent statute laws,
there being treason upon treason committed in this action, may then the
seculars appeal to the same prohibited court against this Archpriest and these
Jesuits: and yet be in no danger of a praemunire (at least) by so doing, or not?

THE ANSWER.
THe case is quite altered in the Jesuits procurement of a Bull, for
establishing the Archpriests authority, and the seculars appeal to the same
Sea against it. vz. First, cui enim iniuria fit, ei accreuit ius vindictae, But
the Pope his Holiness was injured by their suggestions in obtaining the Bull,
ergo. Secondly, the Jesuits in procuring that Bull and authority, made it a
matter of state in prejudice of regal majesty. But the seculars in appealing
made it a matter of conscience, thereby to refell, infringe, and abrogate all
such premunireall treachery. Thirdly, the pretense was made outwardly by the
Jesuits to be wholly for matters pertaining to the Catholic Church, religion
and order in works of charity, piety, devotion, etc. ergo the seculars
approving the contrary (that they never had such a meaning: neither did the
Archpriest practice any such matter) meddle no way in any thing by their
appeal, whereby a praemunire can be incurred, no not so much as
interpretatiuely. Fourthly, the Jesuits bolster out and build, as well the
intruded vsurpate authority of the Archpriest: as also their own treasonable
attempts, plots, and practices, upon the said Bull and his Holiness authority:
ergo none other to appeal unto for justice against them. Fifthly, the seculars
by their appeal clearly exempt, redeem and keep out themselves, from
acknowledging any obedience to that already premunirized Archpriest: and by
consequent from all danger of incurring a praemunire. Sixthly, they labor by
their appeal for security to her Majesty's person, for quiet to the State, for
auoidance of all invasions: for cutting off all conspiracies: State tamperings,
exasperating libels, etc. and for an assurance of relaxation and freedom from
their heavy persecution, procured by the Jesuits against them: as well by false
suggestions to his Holiness: as also by stirring up other Princes against our
Sovereign and nation, and thereby bringing wars and fears upon all, and
hart-breaking frowns to be cast upon the innocent: ergo so clear and far
from all danger of any offense committed by appealing from the Archpriest to
the Sea of Rome, as most dangerous, unjust, unnatural, indiscrete, irreligious
and prejudicial to all, both Pope, Prince, Church, commonwealth and all
estates: if they had not appealed: but let the matter lie dead in discontent,
obloquy and danger of forest trials.

THE VI. ARTICLE.
Whether any danger for the appellants: to side wholly with the Archpriest
hereafter, by making a general peace (upon his assurance made and given of a
non partiality hereafter) and so let the appeal fail, and the pursuit cease,
or not?

THE ANSWER.
IN two cases it were no danger: but a happy yield to the great content,
comfort and quiet of many a devout soul: whose tender hearts lie a bleeding to
hear and see into what pickle we all are brought by the wicked Jesuits
seditious brables and broiles made and raised amongst us. The one case were
thus: if that his Holiness, her Majesty, and the whole realm (wherein I take
parte^ meliorem pro toto, excluding all Iesuited or Puritanized, neither of
which will ever like of, or consent to any good, that to our whole nation in
this case would be) should make a general atonement, league and peace
together, upon such conditions as in their sacred wisdoms and princely
prudence should seem meet, with mutual consent to expel, and call all the
Jesuits and other seditious persons out of the land, or otherwise to have
justice done upon the^ where they shall be taken. The other case might be this:
to wit. If the Archpriest could and would clear himself, shake off these
turbulent Jesuits, and utterly renouncing them, their counsel, advice, and
company, stick fast hereafter to the seculars: which, as it were his best and
surest way to deal for his own quiet, safety and security, both of body and
soul, letting pass these brablings and medlings in matters above his reach,
thrust upon him by the Jesuits of purpose, to make a gull, a stale, a
laughing-stocke, and but an officious instrument of him, to serve their turn
withal: so if the vain conceit of honor, to be of due right belonging unto
him by his place, office and title of Archpresbitery, do still second his
former course in proceeding against the seculars on the Jesuits behalf, then
may there no condition be admitted of by the appealants for peace with him and
them, but with the indangering of themselves to incur a Praemunire, and be in
the same state wherein the said Archpriest and all that seditious faction now
stand: which is to be all hanged for traitors, if the laws be suffered to
pass against them as now they are, and as the case stands. Yea the seculars by
putting up the matter with a colorable peace betwixt them and the Archpriest,
before any order set down by his Holiness for courbing the insolency of the
Jesuits, would be prejudicial not only to themselves, but also to his
Holiness, on whom they will undoubtedly father all their wicked practices
hereafter: and so by consequent this yield would also turn to the prejudice of
the Catholic Church, the commonwealth of this land, and her Majesty's royal
person. All whose general cause and quarrel the seculars having now in hand,
may not in any wise yield before it be ended by his Holiness: and that in a
more serious manner, then ever was in any the like case handled heretofore in
the Court of Rome. For the whole State of Christendom, as well in causes
Ecclesiastical as temporal, will be proved to depend upon it: as hereafter
you shall hear.

THE VII. ARTICLE.
Whether then (seeing it must come to pleading before his Holiness, or ever
the matter can be taken up or ended) are the seculars or the Jesuits likelier
to prevail on the Archpriests behalf. And if the seculars (as some seem to
make no doubt of it, by reason that their plea is on the behalf of the Pope
his Holiness, the whole Church in general (that is, for the Ecclesiastical,
Monastical, and temporal state) and the particular commonwealths, and regal
Majesty's of England, France, Ireland, Scotland, yea of Italy, Spain, Polony,
Sweden and Denmark: together with the Imperialty of Caesar, it standing the
chiefes of all these in both states upon for their own indignity, security and
preservation of their Princely prerogatives to their posterity, to join with
the seculars in this their appeal) then what is like to come to the
Archpriest? etc.

THE ANSWER.
MAchiauell may do much in all courts of Christendom, in moral acts and
humane actions: and therefore although it stand all Princes upon to join with
the seculars, and none more, or so much as her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and her
honorable Counsel: yet considering what factious dispositions there are every
where abroad in the world: what great matters men and money have attempted,
atchiued and effected (contrary to all expectation) to their wish and desire,
and how plausible, tickling and tempting the Jesuits doctrine is of popularity,
to make subjects rebel, act and perform whatsoever they put into their heads
for the conspirators advancement: no Prince in the world but has some great
Lord or other about him, that will be ready to speak a good word for the
Jesuits, in hope of a better turn at their hands at one time or other when
kingdoms are at stake. It follows then that for the present it will be
doubtful, and very hard to say which part, whether seculars or Jesuits shall
prevail. All men that know the Jesuits hard dealings and practices, and what
foul matters they have bolstred, banded, bearded, and borne out against the
greatest and chief Princes on earth, may and do easily conceive thus much:
that look what the devil or man can do, shall not be left undone on the
Jesuits behalf. But seeing truth may be obscured for a time: yet can never be
torn down: so as never after to rise: then make I no question of it, but that
(admit the Jesuits and Puritanes bring in Antichrist betwixt them, who shall do
more against all states and commonwealths and the whole Church of God, then
ever has been, or shall be done by any other besides) notwithstanding in the
end the Jesuits will be quite overthrown. Which happening: then the Archpriest
(standing stiffly out on their side) is like enough to be called out of England
to some preferment for a time: as to be President or Rector of some College or
Seminary, vt cedat cum honor.

THE VIII. ARTICLE.
Whether this appeal and contention betwixt the seculars on the one side, and
the Jesuits with their Archpriest on the other side be like then in the case
last proposed to be the utter overthrow either of the one or other party, or
of neither of both?

THE ANSWER.
DIrectly it can be the overthrow of neither the one party nor the other,
because the seculars are but in statu quo prius, and cannot be in a worse then
they are in at this present. And as for the Jesuits they may pass into India,
and other countries where the rest of their company live. But indirectly it may
be an overthrow of either of both, whose lot it shall fall out unto to be
suppressed and have the foil: and so in that case the Jesuits prevailing, the
poor seculars were as good to be all hanged up together-ward, as live to
endure the insults, triumphs and vpbraidings, that shall be laid upon them in
animating of their saucy laicall faction to glory in their malice, impotent
iniquity, and ouercrowing them for a time: which yet could not be long, as a
thing impossible for any religious order utterly to overthrow (as thereby the
Jesuits would) an ecclesiastical or secular state, on behalf whereof that
sacred sentence was oracled from those lips that could not lie that portae
infernae non praeualebunt aduersus eam. Again, in the same case the seculars
prevailing, the Jesuits of like sort were sure to be overthrown: marry not
with such scofs, taunts, insultations, tyrannies, and triumphs over them as the
others do, and would surely put them more barbarously in practice. But the
Jesuits chief grief, discomfiture, and overthrow would be this (and a greater
to an ambicious aspiring heart there can be none) to be excluded for ever out of
this land, and so frustrate their hope of a Jesuitical Monarchy in the Island
of great Britain.

THE IX. ARTICLE.
Whether then seeing it seems the victory consists wholly on the Popes
decree: (and that whose part he takes, that is sure to prevail) may he then
err in deciding this contention betwixt the seculars and Jesuits: or be
partial on the Archpriest and Jesuits behalf, against the other, or not?

THE ANSWER.
IF the matter come once before his Holiness, I do verily think he cannot:
because, although the ground in show be but of matters of manners yet in re: I
am persuaded they will be drawn to matters of such moment as a visum est
spiritui sancto and nobis, must iudicially pass ex Cathedra, in definitive
sentence against them. Which two the holy Ghost, and spouse of Christ joining
together in judgment, I steadfastly believe they cannot err: and by consequent
make no question of it: but if ever the seculars get safe passage, admittance
and audience, at the sacred chair of Saint Peter, that then down go both
Archpriest and Jesuits, at least by recantation, submission and surcease. But
now for as much as hoc opus, hic labor est: the difficulty is all, how to have
this matter come to light before his Holiness without sinister information or
partial relation made, the memory of many both ancient and recent examples,
putting all men in mind of what may and is (no question) most likely to happen
for a time, scil. that as Parsons and others before used sundry Machiuilean
forgeries, stratagems, plots, practices and devises, for establishing of this
vsurpate Archpresbitery, most impiously therein deluding, abasing and
preiudicing of his Holiness, and the Catholic Churches laws: So may he and
his confederates do the like again, and by consequent the Pope as hitherto
having never heard, nor been fully, exactly and sincerely informed of the truth
of our cause: so hereafter also being stopped (as if it be possible no doubt he
shall) from ever coming to know the sum of the seculars appeal: he may no
doubt both err and be partial therein.

THE X. ARTICLE.
Whether (seeing the Pope may without prejudice be said to be partial upon
wrong information given, without hearing what the plaintiff has to say, and
thereupon judging secundum allegata and probata may also excommunicate, etc.
the innocent, and set the guilty free) if any excommunication then should be
gotten (vtcunque) against all the seculars and others that resist the
Archpriest, commanding all to side with the Jesuits, either on the Spanish or
any other inuadors behalf: or admit (which is impossible) scil. that the
Jesuits and Archpriest had right on their side in the pretended authority of
and for master Blackwell: and that thereupon for the disobedience and contempt
(as the Jesuits term it) the said seculars should be suspended with loss of
all faculties, etc. And further having thus far prevailed against them, and
that justly as (in the case proposed) we must imagine: If then and from
thencefoorth an excommunication, suspension, interdiction, or other
Ecclesiastical censure should pass conceptis verbis from the Sea Apostolic
with general consent of the Cardinals, or procurement of the greater part of
them on the Archpriest and Jesuits behalf, against all their opposites in
whatsoever, were it to be obeyed or not: or if it were in what sort, and
whether vsque ad aras, or how far? etc.

THE ANSWER.
IN this Article are many cross Interrogatories, as scil. First, whether if an
excommunication should be procured on the behalf of an inuador (as
questionless it will, if the Jesuits and Archpriest prevail, and as assuredly
it will be stopped, if the seculars may have audience) against all that should
aid our Sovereign and native country: The point of foreign conquest, and
invasion under color of restoring religion, touches all English Catholics as
near in effect for their lives as it does the Protestants. And by consequent
both Catholics and Protestants have just cause to bear with, and defend the
one the other: in these temporal and moral matters against the Jesuits and
Puritanes, who only seek to stir rebellions of subjects against their
Sovereigns, and urge conquests and invasions of forreiners, against their
country: and both of them under color of religion, to cast a combustion mixed
of s^te, famine and sword, upon our country, without sparing of any man, woman
or child, as the doctrines and proceedings of both make it manifest: that no
Protestants life shall be saved, if the Puritanes preuaile^ nor any Catholic
if the Jesuits prevail: yea questionless the Protestants shall sooner go to
the pot then the Catholics, if the Puritanes prevail: and the Catholics
sooner then the Protestants if the Jesuits (though in conclusion neither shall
be favored not spared. And this was plain by the Duke of Medinaes words, who
being told that there were diverse Catholics in England, answered I care not,
I will make the best Protestants in England as good Catholics as they, if once
I have them under my sword, etc. This has he spoken often in the hearing of
master Wencel^de a Devonshire man and others. So as this and other
intelligences had of the Iesuitical devotion and Spanish favors toward our
nation, and us Catholics does manifest their pretense of religion to be a
bloody presage of a massacring intended conquest.
were it to be obeyed, or not: the inuadour coming with hostile power under
color and pretense of restoring the Catholic faith and religion in this
land? And to this I answer: that it were not to be obeyed. For that although
every Catholic be bound to receive, succor, relieve and aid to his power,
any one that should absolutely (without any further intent) come to restore,
plant and confirm the Catholic faith and religion in this land: yet because
intentio perficit actum: and as (I said in another Quodlibet before) that act
which in it self is good, may both by circumstance and intention be made
naught: And further, for that man's judgment in humane actions whiles he lives
under a mortal sword, comes by senses objects, which are external vt sonus
obiectum auditus, color visus, etc. and for that the outward object moves the
inward sense, then that outward presents it to the inward fantasy and
imagination of man, called sensus internus: and that again by office brings it
into the Court of reason: which reason reflecting upon the primarie object
judges ex cognitione sensibili de intelligibili obiecto, and so we say that
Sacramentum est visibile signum inuisibilis gratiae. Hereupon it comes that be
the protestations never so great to the contrary (morally without approving the
intention to be good by miracle) yet if the external signs be such as they
implicate a contradiction, verbi gratia, as he that should cast a fire-ball into
a house, and yet protest he intended not to burn it: or shoot off a piece at
his supposed friend, charged with powder, bullet, pellet or shot, and yet
intended not to kill him: or violently urge and force a yield to rape, and yet
protest his intention was only to try that woman, but not to ravish her: no
man will believe him. And so in the case proposed: the old Lord Mountacute of
worthy memory, Sir Anthony Brown Vicount Montacute gave a no less catholic
then loyal answer to the like question: saying to this effect: That if the
Pope himself should come in with cross, key and gospel in his hand, he would
be ready with the first to run unto his holiness to cast himself down at his
feet to offer his service unto him in all humblenes of heart, and what not to
show himself a dutiful child. But if in steed of coming in solemn
procession with cross, book, prayers and preaching: he should come in a
sounding royal march with heralds of arms, into banners of blood displaied,
trumpets, alarm, pikes, harquebuse and men of arms all marshald in ranks set
in battle array: then would he be the first man in the field armed at all
points, to resist him in the face with all his might and power he were able to
make; and what not would he do to show himself a dutiful subject naturalized
in an English soil on that behalf. To the like end did his brother in law the
ever honorable Dacre his words tend even in the midst of his prince and
countries enemies. And the same should be every true catholic English man's
resolution. For let the color, pretense and protestation be whatsoever it be
may; yet for that one and the same person may come as an Apostle of Christ or
knight of Mars: and that the marks for others to know him by, which of these
two he is, are not his intentions, protestations, or meaning, but the signs
and tokens he brings with him, together with the manner of his outward actions
and proceedings: we judging as men not as Gods in these cases: knowing that the
words (invasion and hostile power) denotate a general subversion, population
and overthrow of the whole common wealth and state, with slaughter of body,
soul and all together, and not the conversion of any one: no nor preservation
or safety of the already converted (for so said the Duke of Medina in plain
terms) scil. I will respect neither one nor other if I have them once under my
sword, for I mean to make room, place and space there for my master etc.
Neither in very deed in such a case could he almost choose to do otherwise,
though he had a more compassionate, religious and humane heart then any Spaniard
seems to have. For how should he know a catholic from a protestant in the
open field, where is no time to bow nor kneel, unless it be against their
wills. But when besides this it is manifest by the Dukes speeches (yea and the
Jesuits too, at sundry times affirming the same (as father Southwell at
Wisbiche did confess no less in the hearing of diverse priests there
prisoners) that though the inuaders might: yet would they not spare one
catholic in England, more then a protestant, nor so much as they would spare
the puritanes. The reason whereof may be this in their barbarous policy: scil.
least under that pretense (if show of religion might save their lives) all for
the time becoming wholly catholics, would be too many and too strong a party
to remain on live, and ready upon every the least occasion offered, to rise
in arms and take the crown off, from the inuaders head (if invested
therewith:) thrust all forraigners out of the realm, and set up a catholic
king of their own country and nation again. Therefore seeing that to prevent
this inconvenience: the inuader (whosoever) will make sure work (if once he
got footing) without sparing of man, woman or child: besides (those traitors
of Jesuits or puritanes that shall escape perhaps for a time, as coming in
under his banner to betray their native country into his hands:) I hold that
man for worse then mad, that will run upon his own death every way: as
those English do (be they of what religion or profession soever) that should
upon any false persuasion or fear of excommunication or otherwise oppose
themselves against their native prince and country. And if when no such danger
was of utter subversion and destruction of all: yet in these temporal and
martial causes, we find: that no excommunication, suspension or interdiction
did take place so: but that those punished by ecclesiastical censure, did
still prosecute to death, their prince and countries cause (were the said
excommunications or other ecclesiastical censure justly or wrongfully
inflicted, which when hot bloods are up, is not regarded of any) as in the
strife betwixt prince Lewis of France and king John of England, and his son
after him, king Henry 3. and the Baliol and Bruise of Scotland, and sundry other
examples it may appear even in catholic times, when there was no religion but
one: then a fortiori, in the case proposed like to a Danois conquest, when the
pretense is colored with a religious mask, and the pretendor intendes
notwithstanding a general massacre of all indifferently to plant a new people
there with utter extirpation of the ancient inhabitants: there is no sense,
religion, nor sign of humanity in that English heart that would so unnaturally
be deluded with scruples, doubts and sophistical buzzes put into his head in
the premises: as not to resist.

Secondly, an other interrogatorie point or question in the article proposed
is: that supposing the Jesuits and Archpriest had right on their side in the
matters of contention betwixt them (as they seem to make the case as clear
for them as the seculars do on the contrary) and that thereupon they should
justly procure an excommunication with other ecclesiastical censures to be
inflicted according to the quality of the person and the occasion given upon
the part of the appellans and all their adherents, for their contempt,
disobedience etc. formally reestablishing, ratifying and confirming ad amplius
the said Archpriestes authority: whether then ought not the seculars and all
other catholics obey and surcease from further pursuit against either the
Jesuits or Archpriest or no? And to this I answer: that a supposed
proposition must have a supposed solution, scilicet that supposing all were
right, just, lawful and necessary on the Jesuits part, and the quite
contrary on the seculars: then were the seculars not only bound to obey and
surcease, but also to cry peccauimus and submit themselves to do such penance
as should be enjoined them etc. 2. in the case proposed, although they were to
surcease from pursuit of the appeal in that matter: yet were they not bound
to let fall their plea on the behalf of the Catholic Church and common
wealth in general, or of their own native country in special: for that the
matters of contention betwixt the seculars and Jesuits, being of two kinds: the
one proper as concerning the injuries and wrongs done, one to the other, and
the other common, as concerning the injuries and wrongs done to the whole
Church, the common wealth, the supreme power and sovereign Majesty's in both
states: they (being isntrumental agents (and yet withal live members) of the
two bodies mystical and political) were bound to respect Bonum publicum
before priuatum; and by consequent not to desist from prosecuting the appeal
in those cases wherein the interest is in the whole Church and commonwealth,
and not in themselves alone. 3. I say the supposition is but a mere
metaphisicall or rather chymericall supposall or conceit: neither do I think
that there is any Jesuit in England this day, but in his own conscience he
knows he is in the wrong, and that the seculars have the right on their side,
as well in the particular as general action, and by consequent it is
impossible: (as I said in the former article) but that if ever the matter come
to pleading, it will go on the seculars side against them. 4. I say more that
admit an excommunication should be gotten and procured (suggesto mendacio)
against them for the one cause or the other: yet were the excommunicated
suspended, etc. only propter obedientiam to forbear coming at, or having the
use of the Sacraments. But no further: so as in prosecuting their appeal, or
doing of any other act for the furtherance of their cause, they were as free as
before, from all sin or other offense in not obeying any charge laid, or
commandment given them to the contrary. 3. A third interrogatorie point, does
seem to import thus much in this article scz. whether an excommunication,
suspension, etc. being gotten quo iure quaue iniuria, against the seculars and
their adherents hanging the appeal, were it to be obeyed or not, in forbearing
to come at the altar or Sacraments? Whereunto I answer. 1. That Post
appellationem factam manis est excommunicatio, or as says the gloss, Nemo
potest excommunicari. 2. That admit there had been no appeal, yet could no
excommunication, suspension etc. bind them in the case proposed in foro
conscienti^e quia litterae impetratae suggesto mendacio, non nocent eis contra
quos impetrantur etc. and sententiae contra leges canonesue perlatae, debent
vtique pro infectis haberi etc. 4. Lastly a question does rise here out of
this article whether in foro exter. an excommunication, suspension etc. do
always bind or not, The Archpriest is known directly to have no such
authority as he and master Parsons giu^ ^ut he has to excommunicate, suspend
etc. neither was his holiness priu^ to his vsurpate int^nt on in taking more
upon him than he has granted, ergo ad plac^ tum, whether any will obey him in
the points in question or not, etc.
verse. gra. whether if by means made to his holiness on the Jesuits and
Archpriests behalf, there should a precept, brief, or bull be obtained to
command all Catholics to be at master Blackwels command, and to obey him in
all things, sub paena excommunicationis, suspensionis, amissionis omnium
facultatum, etc. were it to be obeyed or not.

To which I answer, first, that it were as is said before, scil. to suffer
patiently that just torment inflicted upon them (if known directly that it
were his holiness will and intent to have it so) by refraining from the
Sacraments: and thus much propter obedientiam piae iurium ecclesiam eiusque
cap. Romans po. tum ad euitandum scandalum, which in this case might happen to
the infirm and weak Catholics, iudgeing it to proceed of contempt and
disobedience to the sea Apostolic: if they should presume to come at the holy
altar, or frequent any Sacraments being excommunicated etc. though never so
wrongfully and iniustly. Secondly, that notwithstanding such an
excommunication, yet the said seculars and their adhaerents might proceed as
before, either in prosecuting the appeal begun, or beginning a new, and
following of the same: Note that the Archpriest cannot have authority from the
Pope to stop all appeals from him to the Pope: and by consequence th^ugh in
Blackwell had authority to excommun^cate, suspend, etc. in all things (which
he has not, neither da^e take it upon him to defend, he has so) yet were his
excommunication void both in foro conscientiae and ecclesie, in this case of
forbidding appeals wherein so free al men were from any bond to obey as they
were bound to disobey it, and reject him as an Antipape.
notwithstanding any command or authority to the contrary: until such time as
the truth of their cause were made known to his holiness, and that they had
received his resolute answer. Which had, no such censure could be incurd,
because the wrong accrewing in ius suum by making the Archpriest above
himself: it were not in the Popes power to give him such an authority, and
remain Pope after it: for that the passage of an appeal must always be from
an inferior to a superior: ergo if master Blackwell have authority to command
that none shall write, nor send, nor seek for justice from him to the Pope,
nor (and by consequent then it follows) to any other, but whom he shall
assign (as his charge given to the apellants, to go into the Low countries,
etc. includes so much arrogancy and usurpation of a supremacy at least) under
pain of excommunication etc. then it follows that he the said Blackwell is
the supreme head of the church Catholic, (at least, here in England, from
whom there is no appeal to be made: but all injuries to be borne off with head
and shoulders: neither will his or the Jesuits excuse for him serve their
turns: to say, the seculars appeal is but about frivolous and light matters in
themselves, proceeding of a seditious, stubborn, disobedient, obstinate and
contentious spirit, not well established in the grace of God, etc. In all which
cases it were expressly against the Canons to disobey him, or to appeal from
him, as from (say they) their lawful superior, and by consequent that he may
command them not to trouble his holiness with such brabling matters etc. I say
this neither will, neither shall serve his turn. For if they be but trifles or
wranglings, A Bishop cannot authorize his chaplein: a king his secretary: not
the Pope his protonotary in things wherein the so authorized depriues the
authorizer of his superiority over him, and withal of the chief act of
justice and title of his dignity and honor belonging to his person or place,
but must withal make him by that act his superior, because no duals in
popedomes, kingdoms or Bishopr ckes but all singles as one in one, etc.
then have the seculars the woorst of it, being sure to be sharply punished
when the plea shall come before his holiness: but if otherwise it will prove:
then videant ipsi Iesuitae, cum suo Archipr. But howsoever, be it so, or be it
not, yet the seculars affirming that it is of matters of most moment that ever
happened in this age: as both by these 10. Quodlibets and sundry other books
written of this subject may and will appear: it is neither Blackwell, nor
Garnet, nor Parsons, nor Lucifer, nor who is the prowdest of them: to face it
with greatest impudency that shall dare presume to be judge therein, or stop
it from coming to his holiness, but shall be noted for an Antipope at least.

Thirdly I say further, that suppose there were neither Rex nor summus Pontifex
in all the world (as for the space of 2000. years or thereabout it was so, the
first borne son of every family being that while (under the law of nature)
both king and priest in authority, without the name: and that all government
on earth were (as it should be in that case) Aristocraticall, yet did not that
hinder but that still a subordinate power shoud be as well in the church as
commonwealth, and law and justice there take place in order, so as always an
appeal might be lawful and not deniable from an inferior person, court,
corporation, commonwealth, or what name, title, or authority soever to a
superior (but not on the contrary in any of these without prejudice of the
predominant) and so from one to another till it come to the chief and highest
court. Yea this kind of subordination is even in the laws themselves, the
Civil laws (or laws Common here in England, which equal the laws Civil)
being inferior to the laws Canon, or municipall in this land, as is clear by
a plea which ordinarily may be removed from the common Law into the court of
Chauncery: and the law Canon inferior to the law of Nature and Nations (which
commonly is taken to be one with Natures law) and again the law of Nature to
the Law of God, as it is given written, or otherwise left in the Church
dictante spiritu sancto, and therefore called the Law divine, because it is of
divine institution. Though in very, deed the law primary of reason depending
upon synderisis, and the Law divine, or of God relatione ad creaturas, and also
the Law of nature, be often taken for all one: upon which conjunctions,
divisions, and distinctions, I have treated at large in the answer to the
first part of Parsons Doleman: and therefore thereupon we will not now stand.
Only this is enough to know for the present, that all humane laws are
subordinate to natures Law: and natures Laws to the Law Primary of God
himself, which we call, Diuina voluntas, or the aeternall Law; and by
consequent the legifers of the same laws, are so subordinate one under an
other: as when a case comes once to the highest Legifer on earth, there is
thence no further appeal to be made but all wholly left to Gods just
judgments, Primam enim sedem nemo iudicare potest.

Out of these grounds then I gather these corolaries: First, that the Popes
excommunication etc. for any matters under his Pontifical jurisdiction and
power (although unjustly inflicted) were to be obeyed in not ministering nor
receiving of any Sacrament until the party were absolved etc. Secondly, that
no excommunication can stop any man from seeking of justice. Thirdly, that no
excommunication of his for disobedience to his holiness self, in things
commanded by him, contra ius diuinum vel naturae: does or can take place either
in foro conscientiae vel ecclesiae: because these laws and legifers are above
him and his law. Fourthly, that master Blackwell and his Jesuits with all those
of their faction, are ipso facto thought to be excommunicated for usurping the
Popes authority etc. Fifthly, that he can debar no man from appealing to the
Sea apostolic for any cause whatsoever: the worst being the appellants, if the
cause be naught: as thereby incurring sometimes an excommunication, suspencion,
etc. Sixthly, that it is mere calumniation, falsehood, and slander for that
seditious faction: to give out: that any one of the Catholics are
excommunicated. Seventhly, that neither he nor any Jesuit in England dare for
their lives stand to it, to affirm: that all or any of the appellants are
excommunicated for that action. Eighthly, that he is a flat antipope in
presuming to command any not to seek for justice against him to the Sea
apostolic, and the like is for his, and his Jesuitical faction in their
extreme arrogance, in blazing it abroad: that it is an act of disobedience,
contempt etc. Ninthly, that no such authority can be given him as to command
any to obey him in all things. Tenthly, that not the Pope himself can command
any, in and by such general terms of obedience in all things. Eleuenthly,
that if the seculars had been justly excommunicated for any matter depending
upon the appeal: it had and ought to have holden still, hanging the same
appeal: because no dispensation can be granted where the party is bent to
continue in that state: for the prosecuting whereof the excommunication,
suspencion, etc. past against him. Twelfthly, that if the seculars had been
excommunicated for any other matter independent upon the appeal, there is not
a priest in England almost, but has authority to absolve him: and so does it
show the malice of the Jesuits to be so much greater, seeing no such thing, but
that, if it were, yet an absolution did free them again: they notwithstanding
do drive conceits into the peoples hearts as though they remained still in a
damnable state: which is as much to say as they cannot be absolved, (the
grossest absurdity and greatest impiety that ever was heard of) every one
seeing and knowing: that the greatest heretic that is may be absolved, and
restored to his former state again. And therefore they denying this benefit
to a Catholic priest show themselves flat usurpers, as before, and a worse
thing besides. 13. That there is no question to be made of it, but if it be
possible the Jesuits will procure an excommunication against the seculars to
confirm their former false reports and slanders, that they were excommunicated
etc. before. 14. That no excommunication on the inuadors behalf does bind any
man to take his part against his prince and country. 15. That to this day was
there never any excommunication, suspencion, interdiction, etc. gotten from the
Sea of Rome, and denounced against any Prince, person, common-weath, or other
state on the behalf of any one ceteris paribus, like to this procured already
by the Jesuitical faction against their Prince and country on the behalf of
Spainiards. 16. That as the prudent Greek appealed from Alexander furious to
Alexander sober, and bishop Crostate from Pope Adrian private to Pope Adrian
public: and as Summus pontifex in cathedra Petri: so may the seculars
notwithstanding any decree set down by his holiness to the contrary by wrong
information given: appeal even from the Pope, as Clement, unto his holiness,
as Peter, on their own and their Prince and countries behalf.

THE ARGUMENT OF THE SEVENTH GENERAL QVODLIBET.
THe reasons alleged in the last Quodlibet against the mischievous plots and
practices as well in esse, as intended by the Jesuitical intruded authority of
Blackwels vsurpate Archpresbytery, ministers occasion to speak in this place
of matters concerning as well the seculars as the Jesuits proceedings, with and
on the behalf of the catholic Church and common-welth. Of which subject there
are two distinct Quodlibets occurring fitly to our purpose to be discussed and
reasoned of: and both of them tend to one end, but by a diversity of plots
casting in the way and manner of progress to the thing they aim at on both
sides. And therefore shall the first be a Quodlibet of plots by religion: that
is in what sort, and how far both seculars and Jesuits do and may deal on
the behalf of Gods church for conversion of their country, and
re-establishing of the catholic faith and religion. The other general
Quodlibet shall be of State affairs, as how they either do or may meddle
therein on the behalf of their country, pretending religion as the ground of
all the controversy.

THE SEVENTH GENERAL QVODLIBET OF PLOTS by Religion.
THE I. ARTICLE.
Whether the seculars or Jesuits seek more soundly the conversion of their
country from all schism and heresy.

THE ANSWER.
IT is without all question the seculars seek it more soundly, sincerely,
religiously, and Apostlelikely, pz. for that the seculars take the very direct
course that our Savior Christ left, for, and to all his apostles to imitate,
scil. First, to seek the conversion of souls by preaching and teaching, and
good example giving by word and action. Secondly, by doing all things gratis,
taking only things necessary for their maintenance and relieuing of their
present wants. Thirdly, not fishing after unlawful gains to enrich themselves
by couine and hypocrisy or other means. Fourthly, in relieuing those that
want gratis either with their own superfluity (if their patrimonies be great)
or with and out of that which is given them gratis. Fifthly, to make no
exceptions of persons in bestowing of Gods graces upon them, but as ready to
go barefoote to save a poor beggars soul, as in a coche of gold to reconcile
a king. Sixthly, to give honor to every one, where, in what sort, and as far as
is due: Cui vectigal, vectigal etc. Seventhly, to keep an order in charitable
respects had of one person more then another: when it comes to a matter of
moment to be done: wherein partiality may be used: always respecting the
place, woorthines, deserts, and other circumstances of the person annexed unto
the cause etc. Eighthly, to prefer (in all things of importance) the common good
either of the Church or common wealth before the private good of any particular
person or corporation in either state. Ninthly, to live orderly, warily and
friendly in conuersing with every one Nemini dantes vllam offensionem, and most
of all not exasperating the adversaries. Tenthly, to be ready prepared to do
good to all maxim autem domesticis fidei. Eleuenthly, to respect the public
good of all: not the private corporation of any in using bitter, sharp and
gauling speeches, by fraternall correction or discovering of the infest vices
of any one more then another. Twelfthly, to give and teach obedience to all
superiors in order, as in latricall adoration and honor to God alone: in
reverence to priesthood: in loyalty to regal majesty: in filial love: to
parents spiritual or temporal: and in all these wherein obedience does
consist, how far it does extend: in what cases that sentence obediendum est Deo
magis quam hominibus, stands infringible without reply, exception or
mitigation: and how obedience in one person may be simul and semel in diverse
respects had to two adversaries or opposite one to the other, without offense
justly given to either, always concluding with this admonition given to every
one: reddite quae sunt Caesaris Caesari, and quae sunt Dei, Deo.

In these and many the like, have the seculars immitated so far as humane
frailty could, the example of their Lord and master Jesus Christ in laboring
for the conversion of souls in their country more apostlelike then the
Jesuits have; who in every particular are found halting down right: as in all
these Quodlibets does manifestly appear. Besides there are yet other
particular differences which make the case more apparent. First, for that the
Jesuits are a society and corpotation of themselves apart, sequestered not
only from other particular orders of religion, as Dominicans are from
Franciscans, and Franciscans from Augustines, and Augustines from Benedictines,
and so one from another by the rules of every particular order: but also and
much more then any other religious company from the whole ecclesiastical and
secular state: whereas the seculars are of the whole, public and common body
both of the Church and commonwealth (that is both of the body mystical of
Christ, and the body political of their country) and as indifferent to a
Benedictine, Augustine, Jesuit, etc. as to a Bishop, Deane, Parson, Vicar, etc.
I mean that though ingenerall terms for matters of faith and religion, they
all both secular and religious, ecclesiastical and monastical, are equally
members of the catholic church, the body mystical of Christ: and as all
corporations, companies, and societies in every common-welth are equally
members ingenerall of that same body political, common-welth, kingdom, and
state where they live: and yet may some of them be more dangerous or secure,
commodious, or inconvenient, partial, or indifferent to that state
ecclesiastical or temporal, church or common-welth where they live, the^
others are or perhaps can be; by reason of more particular respects of
propriation or otherwise, then others have: yet you will grant, and none will
deny any Benedictine to labor lawfully for his own order sooner and more
seriously then for the Carthusians, in obteining of immunities, privileges,
prerogatives, liuelihoods, mortmaines, and whatsoever they may lawfully receive
and keep, for maintaining themselves and their order to serve there Lord God
in that state of life they have taken themselves unto. Neither is it to be
thought otherwise but that the Archbishop of York would if a commodity were
to be had, and in his gift to bestow it where he list, more respect any
particular church, chapter, or chapel under him and within his own dioces,
then an other of like condition unto it within the dioces of Canterbury. Nor
can it be thought otherwise but that the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and others of the
free companies of London, should have a more special care of augmenting their
own privileges and the enriching of that city then the city of Couentrie, or
any other corporation or town, though the same were even also infranchized in
their liberties. Of like sort then the Jesuits being a corporation of
themselves, possessing neither lands nor house, nor interest to any one (but in
their own vain conceits) in England, and being a company or society gathered
together of all christian people and nations: and finally this land as well by
the fall and suppression of the Abbeyes: as also by sundry other dangers
wherein it stands, being now brought by their mischievous drifts and devises,
and especially by popular doctrine to lie open to the spoil of who that first
can catch it: there is no question in it: but that the Jesuits seek their own
private gain, profit, and advancement, in the conversion of England more then
the seculars do: who are of no corporation, but as public or common members
of the whole body, labor for all ecclesiastical, monastical, secular,
religious, spiritual and temporal, and for this and that church, Bishopric,
city, town, parish, corporation, society, etc. alike: as being free to
incorporate themselves to any particular, either ecclesiastical or monastical
state when they list, and when occasion shall be offered: and having no peculiar
corporation nor company to leave that unto which they get, but in general to
their successors in the church of God, and their harvest to whosoever it shall
happen: it is plain in common sense, that they seek more sincerely the
conversion of their country then the Jesuits do. Secondly, they take a right
apostolical course, laboring to stop all occasions of shedding any man's
blood: and if some must be shed, yet rather exposing themselves with patience
to all hazards in suffering their own blood, to be shed for preaching,
teaching, and exercising of all other priestly functions, then in seeking to
shed or to have any others to be shed, either by invasions, rebellions, or
other treasons or conspiracies, whatsoever as the Jesuits do: ergo their
intention, action, and proceeding is more Apostolic, religious, and sincere.
Thirdly, the very speeches that go abroad of both together, with the noted
practice and experience had of both their dealings, do manifest it. For who
does not see, what a general calamity, and extreme want and misery all
catholics, as well secular as lay persons live in, that are not Iesuited: what
huge sums of money they collect every year (as before has been touched in
part) what banks they have in other countries, and yet no pity, no relief,
no respect had of any that are not of their corporation, or as brokers
dependent upon them to serve their turns withal, used as bondslaues to enrich
themselves with that they have or can gain by them. Fourthly, I here omit
their officious enterprises for the conversion of their country: their seeking
of superiority over the seculars: their bars put into all the blood royal
of this land to disinherite them: their division made of all, both
ecclesiastical, monastical, and temporal states, corporations and houses of
any reckoning within the land: their devises to prevent as much as they can
possibly, that no other religious order, especially no Benedictine nor
Dominican shall come within the realm: In few look into their whole course
and manner of proceedings for their countries conversion: and you shall find
nothing but a large exchequer of a charter of policies, how to bring by exchete
the whole church and commonwealth to be under their private corporation and
society: and so quite altering the course of conversion of countries, into a
profession of a kind of Lumbards: Senseless be that man or woman holden for
ever hereafter: that shall judge any sincerity, fidelity, natural and
humane affection, or other good meaning, to be in them, for reestablishing of
religion or planting the catholic faith in their country, if they may have
the swing and bear the sway.

THE II. ARTICLE.
Whether the seculars or Jesuits have had heretofore, or have now more secret
intercourse and dealings inwardly and underhand with all or any of the Lords or
other magistrates under her majesty here in England, or king James in Scotland
etc.

THE ANSWER.
THe answer to this article pertaines directly to a matter of state, and
therefore shall it be handled more peculiarly in the next general Quodlibet of
statizing, against Parsons the Archstatist of the Jesuits. For the present, the
question here intended is as of a matter of religion, scil. whether of them
being both catholics have more close dealings with the common adversaries in
religion to them both. The cause of which question does rise upon these
Zoilists envious aemulation: that some few seculars (whom they thought either
to have deprived of their lives, or pulled them down so low as never after to
have risen) have by Gods providence found grace, favor and justice at her
Majesty's hands: by opening their innocence and loyal hearts toward her
royal person and their native country, to those in authority under her
Highness: as master doctor Bagshaw (whose death they most treacherously
sought) and others (whom now they seeing to have cleared themselves of al state
medles, and thereupon to have found extraordinary favor) these most malicious,
restles slanderers, invent a new devise: that seeing they cannot prevail with
the adversaries against the innocent, to bring them to the gallows: they will
spit out their gaul against them to catholics, to make them to be holden and
accounted of as spies, atheistes, irreligious, and such as have (forsooth)
extraordinary intercourse with some Lords or others in authority for the
state, and thereupon more favor then others have, or then any sound catholic
can have, or should seek for, or accept of. In regard of which viperous speech
(fitter for a feinde then faithful soul) the question here is moved: if it
be an offense to have any secret dealings with the civil magistrate, then
whether the seculars or Jesuits have offended more therein. To which I answer
here in brief: that if any offense be in that action, the Jesuits will
ouerweigh as far the seculars in that as a horse load will a pound weight: as
the practices and dealings of their Parsons, their Heywoods, their Holts, their
Holtbeis, their Creswele, their Garnets, etc. will testify it, by sundry
letters and witnesses against them to be brought forth and showed at time
convenient. Yea do they think it is unknown under whose wings the Archpriest
lives shrouded, or to and from whom the letter was sent on father Gerards
behalf, to wish her (after some few complements and thanks for the token she
sent him) to keep her jewel (the said Gerard) well, etc. or who they be,
that plie and plead for the Jesuits underhand, and to whom in special
intelligence is given from time to time of all that ever they know that may not
touch the Jesuits: or sometimes by accusing some of their own company, to
contriue some dishonest or sluttish part they are about, more handsomely then
otherwise they could, or by whom they are backed to be so bold as they are, both
in prison and abroad, to make their vaunt that they have more and greater
friends both in the English and Scottish Court; then the seculars have: more
then half (naming some particular nobles and others in high esteem and
authority under her Majesty) that are secretly entered into league with them
(forsooth) on the Spanish behalf. Nor noe, it is but a base fear of that
servile Parsons mind, least by this favor showed of her Majesty, her
honorable Counsel, and other magistrates to those tried to be innocent and
guiltless of the general jealousy for conspiracies, had of all for their
sakes: his treasons and treacheries should boult out more speedily, and not
have so safe close, and secret means to tamper with any, to deal on his
behalf with her Highness: to accept of him for a spy, as erst he offered
himself to be so: with deep protestation and many vows and circumstances,
that he would (yea and no doubt but in matters for his own advantage he does)
by his agents give intelligence to the state of all things that ever he should
hear of, to be intended any way against her person, crown or kingdom;
working in the mean while notwithstanding underhand with the late Earl of
Essex, to be the king of Spaines close Pensioner for furthering of the
invasion: and yet again at the same time dealt so, as it should have been
bewraied to the late Lord Treasurer Cicill: and thus the cogging mate never
deals with any of this land: but it is to work their greater, heavier, and
more speedy ruin. So as I conclude that the Jesuits have more secret, close,
and inward dealings under hand with the civil magistrate, then the seculars
have: who go, speak, and deal openly, not afraid nor ashamed of any thing
they do or treat of, with whomsoever it shall please God to move the hearts to
listen unto or favor them: and by consequent the Jesuits close tamperings
shows them to be most pernicious, dangerous, irreligious, infest, and enemies
to the church and commonwealth of this and all other lands, their own guilty
consciences accusing them by their words and actions. For true it is, Quimale
agunt odit lucem: and veritas non quaerit angulos.

THE III. ARTICLE.
Whether then is it lawful or not for either secular or Jesuit to have
intercourse with any of their common adversaries in religion, or to endeavor
themselves to get and win favor of those now in authority under her Majesty:
and if they may, then whether and aequally with both Lords and states
ecclesiastical and temporal: or with which most freely and without scandal
or offense may they seek unto for succor, the said seculars and Jesuits
standing in opposition one against the other, as they in this point of
intercourse with both their adversaries concerning the conversion of their
country etc.

THE ANSWER.
THere is no difference nor exception of persons, places, offices or
professions to be put in those of authority under her Majesty: but whosoever
her highness has appointed for to have the dealings in these affairs, all is
one for them, that are to seek favor by that means. Neither is there any
doubt to be made, but that it is lawful for either of them apart, or both
seculars and Jesuits together, to seek for favor at the civil magistrate or
any others hands. Some of these maleuolous Iesuitical faction have given it out
as a most odious thing for her Majesty to be in league with the Turk,
notwithstanding all that know any thing, know it to be a common matter for both
Pope and prince of any nation to enter into league or truce with him for their
own more safety, as the Spaniard has. So as a man may see all their drift is
but to make all men's actions odious that is or may be a hinderance to their
platform, though the same thing be practiced by them or their faction.
Only these envious Jesuits and their faction to make it seem more odious to
the catholic laity: make a difference as though it were more lawful to have
dealings with the Lord Treasurer, or any other civil magistrate of and in the
temporal state, then with the Archbishop of Canterbury or Bishop of London or
the like. Whereof I can conceive no other reason then that fulsome smell of
puritanisme: which remains in them, as to whom the very name of a Bishop is
most odious as it seems. And knowing that these two have written, spoken, and
otherwise dealt most against their fellow puritanes (in faction if not in
faith) belike this is that, which makes them murmr and speak against
diverse, but especially Master Bluett a reverend old secular priest, and truly a
worthy confessor before some of these pure Jesuits his malicious aemulators)
knew what religion meant, and so he does still; and no doubt by Gods special
grace but he will still so remain when the froth of their zeal shall be
frozen in their hearts. But well: let it pass. It is but a Pharisaicall blast
of a Jesuitical poisoned breath. God of his mercy grant that poor afflicted
catholics may from henceforth find such friends in Court or of Counsel,
that may be in such grace and favor, either as fautors of our religion, or as
compassionates of our afflictions, that in either or both respects, as patrones
of our innocence, they may supply to their lasting credit, renown, and
woorthily merited fame, the place on our behalfes to our noble Elizabeth: of an
honorable Sebastian a wise Gamaliel, a grave Aramathian Joseph, a zealous
Daniell, a princely Zorobabell, a learned Esdras, a pitiful Ester. And so make
I no doubt, but by such no less lawful and commendable, then necessary (and
of all true catholic loyal English hearts to be both earnestly prayed and
heartily wished for) means: that royal and princely heart, always of her own
sweet nature inclined to mercy, lenity, compassion and pity: will at length
grant a refocillation, relaxation, and free liberty to her faithful subjects
worn out bodies in her prisons, to pass abroad and serve their Lord God
without fear, and her Highness without fainting. The very conceit of so
gracious a smile cast on their long frowned on heavy hearts (O God) would force
out filial floods of streaming tears: so natural it is to loyal subjects
(yea to whom not, of a humane heart) to be overcome in ecstasies of affections,
especially in conceited joys: when the loss, they most lamented, is repaied
in place least expected: and that which ever they most wished for, comes in time
most unlooked for. What shall I say more, Corpora magnanimo satis est
prostrasse leoni.

THE IIII. ARTICLE.
Whether more secure then, for the catholic laytie (seeing both priests and
Jesuits may make friends where they can) to join with the seculars or with the
Jesuits.

THE ANSWER.
THis might seem a frivolous question, were it not that the Jesuits make such
vaunts of so many great princes and potentates that are their friends, though
they have just none indeed of any account save only the Spaniard, and he (as I
said before) using them but as the Emperor Charles used Cardinal Wolsey, to
serve his turn for the time. For seeing by all that we have said and intend to
speak or write of this matter, it is evident: that the Spaniard or Austrian
can not be, (neither are they) ignorant how the Jesuits serve their own turns,
with bolstring out their doings, and fathering of their actions upon them.
They no doubt will repay them back with like measure again in a higher degree
of reproach, shame, and confusion. For it is an honorable policy in princes to
entertain spies, counterfeits, and traitors: but it is a base ignominy in
subjects to presume so to dally with sovereigns. Therefore let brag prove a
good dog at home: when it comes to grapling it will be tried the surest way
to take the seculars part.

THE V. ARTICLE.
Whether any danger can come or be intended against all catholics in general,
as well priests as lay persons by the extraordinary favor showed toward
certain of the seculars, and on their behalf toward many catholics that are
known not to be Iesuited: or is there no danger therein at al.

THE ANSWER.
THere neither is, neither can be any danger in the world therein to any one.
But this doubt comes of a Jesuitical envy and malice toward the seculars:
like to the same their speeches in effect used in France and against the French
king, when they enuiously murmuring at the peace, was there concluded upon,
used most slanderous detracting speeches, and put an hundred rebellious doubts
and irreligious conceits in the peoples hearts against it, and so have they
done, and will do, the like here in England if any peace or quiet may be
happily obtained to catholics to live secure and without trouble, of danger of
law for their conscience and religions sake. Which (I fear) would even break
the Jesuits envious hearts to think on, and make them burst out into an open
rebellion; either to hinder it, or to have it concluded on their side. For
whereunto otherwise did tend father Parsons speech, whereof I told you before,
when he was so vehement against the peace in speech, to have been betwixt her
Majesty and the king of Spain, in that league with France, etc. And did not
the same tend to the same effect in France, when one said, I pray God it be
for good that this peace is made betwixt Spain and France; an other, the king
of France is but a dissembler, and never meant, nor will mean well to the
catholic church, or setting up of religion: and an other, that he was a
reprobate of God forsaken, and therefore made but show of religion for a time,
to entrap the catholic more cunningly thereby. And even so say they here in
England, that this extraordinary favor granted to some in special, is but to
intrappe all in general: to get out the number of concealed catholics by this
means, and to take advantages of I cannot tell you what, nor they much less
have any reason to imagine what they maliciously babble of. As though the
number of catholics, yea, and of those that are catholic affected were not
known in every shire, city, town and parish throughout England: ere ever any
of those favors were showed: or as though there need any fitter, speedier, or
more assured means to entrap whom they please then are already, and of long
time have been used by spies, searches, and other means: or finally as though
favor in mitigation were as dangerous, as rigor in execution of justice, or
inflicting of punishments ordained by laws already made, of no less force
then to take away the lives of what catholic soever they please if extremity
were showed against them, according to the statutes, and as now our ticklish
state by means of these Jesuitical conspiracies stands. Therefore still say
I, (and every day will pray for it on my knees in my best poor devotions) God
of his mercy send us peace, that we may live without fear of serving our Lord
God in any the closest manner, secretly in our chambers. And further it is to
be both wished and prayed for, that God may move, First, his Holiness heart to
call these seditions out from amongst us, who hinder (of mere spite, pride,
and envy) all good acts done by any that are not theirs; Secondly then, her
Majesty and honorable Counsel, to look upon our miseries, and not to impute
to the innocent, these malignant speeches of the Jesuits in prejudicial
iealousies and suspicions had of this greatly and only hoped for favor to
ease languishing hearts with all: Thirdly, and last of all, the devout catholic
laity, that they may no longer be blinded with the workers of their woes: such
as they may see daily more and more, Quaere quae sunt deorsum non quae sunt
sursum, and care not what misery, danger, persecution, or other affliction,
any or all the catholics in England suffer so their turns may be served
thereby.

THE VI. ARTICLE.
WHether then (if no danger can possibly come to those that side with the
seculars in laboring for this general good, ease and safety of and to all
catholics or schismatikes, that would be catholics but for fear of
imprisonment, loss of lands and goods, and life it self, or other sharp
punishments ordained to be inflicted upon catholic Recusants by penal laws)
can any danger come to the country to such either catholic or schismatike as
either join, or (at least) seem to favor the Jesuits more then the seculars,
and speak all wholly on their behalf against the other party: or if they
stand neuters and indifferents to both: yet refuse either to subscribe to the
general appeal on their Prince, their country, their own and the seculars
behalf: or to be Vmpiers in the matter for the conditions to be agreed upon
betwixt her Majesty's honorable assigns on the one side, and the catholics
her loyal subjects suppliants on the other side: or otherwise deny their
consent, yield and concurrence to the furtherance of this so gracious and (in
very deed) miraculous incline of her Majesty and honorable Counsel to
mitigate our general heavy persecution and affliction: or how stands, or is
like to stand the case with such as refuse in the premises?

THE ANSWER.
MIght it be without offense to exemplate out of Parsons Philopater, by what
means the change of religion came, I could descrie the coast by color of the
sand, and set you down the case clear and easy to be understood of every
one. But letting former examples pass, I say no more thereof then this; that
be you fully persuaded and assured what bribes can work, what gifts can win,
what women can move (and none more potent in moving then they (said Parsons
in Greenecote:) what lying can deceive in, what impudency can face, what
flattery can allure to, what promises can entice to, what hope can urge, what
protestations can persuade to, what wit can invent: to hinder all furtherance
aid, consent, or good liking to be had of this favor to be showed, that same
shall not be wanting to the uttermost. But yet this withal will I give them to
weerds, that those who are now furthest of from liking or consenting to the
seculars in their action: shall wish when they cannot help it, that it had
been nearest them in smothering of them and it both, with all their might: and
so to the diversely membred article I answer thus diversely. First, that these
lay catholics as are eager on the Jesuits or Archpriests behalf, are
hereafter in the same predicament of a praemunire, treason, etc. that their
good ghostly fathers before spoken of are in. Secondly, that ere these matters
came to light, and before the appeal was made, there was no more danger in
following of a Jesuit or the Archpriest, then in following a Seminary or other
secular priest: because they were not then discovered, the one from the other:
nor ever should have been in those cases if the Jesuits might have had their
wills as the only Scugge, buckler and sconce, they had to bear off all the
blows that of due right should have fallen upon them: and not of the innocent
seculars, which was and is, one special cause why they labor so mightily to
make all books (written of these matters, in discovery of their egregious
impiety both against the Church and commonwealth) to seem so odious, and to
suppress so much as lies in them, the Printing, and if not the Printing, yet
the reading; and if not the reading, yet the believing of any thing in them, to
be true: though the authors have and do still offer body for body to burn at
a stake, or hang on the gallows for trial, in auerring or recanting of
whatsoever (in substance) has been written or spoken against them. Thirdly,
as for neuters or indifferents, they do but themselves wrong: in causing a
jealous conceit perhaps causeless to be had of them. Fourthly, for those that
refuse to deal being moved to be vmpiers, or otherwise to further so good,
commendable, and memorable an enterprise, which no doubt but will be commended
to all posterity: let them look to the danger that may ensue: and so I leave
them to their best thoughts had of those matters; fearing least some of them
will too truly verify the saying: that a Counselor at law, is as wise as a
dawe unless he be amongst fools, etc. For I was not ignorant at the writing
hereof, how some Jesuitical lawyers that seem some body, and are taken so to
be, both schismatike some, and catholic others: have not only refused
themselves, but made others refuse to deal herein. Sed videant ipsi.

THE VII. ARTICLE.
Whether (seeing many both catholics and schismatiks do mightily dislike
this discovery of the Jesuits secret faults) admit it were true, and that the
Jesuits had given just cause for their injuries and wrongs done to the seculars
(both which their fautors deny, and therefore account this writing and setting
out of books with such bitter sharp gauling words to be nothing else but
infamous libelling, or Ouidian inuectiues, or Horatian Satyriques, of purpose
to banish at least the Jesuits out of this land:) could there then any danger
of body or soul come to the Jesuits by relinquishing of them with a general
consent of all, both catholics and schismatiks (for schismatiks are most
deluded and easeliest inueagled with fabulous reports given out of them) to
follow and join with Priests for securing of her Majesty's royal person and
her realm: and auoidance of all incombrances or iealousies, to be hereafter
had of catholics (her highness ever most loyal subjects:) or whether their
indangering (if any were by this means) would not endanger the whole realm or
no?

THE ANSWER.
IF a man will not be carried away with words and wind, but will deeply enter
into the consideration of things so as by proofs and probates he does find
most like to be true: he cannot choose but think this question frivolous as
wholly depending upon these weak grounds, and too too gross conceits of any
half witted body to be possessed or interteined scz. First, that it is not
possible for such things to be true as is here and in other books discovered
of the Jesuits: and by this rash resolve, they give more sanctity to these
Jesuits then to the Pope himself: who having greater, Note here differentiam
actus liberi arbitrij. All angels, devils and mortal men have free will by
creation: but the angels only ad bonum can not sin if they would: the devils
ad malum cannot do good: and men ad vtrum. libet may either do good or evil,
as they list: because as yet in via, whereas the other two are in patria
assigned unto them: to live the one, to die the other therein for ever.
more and more effectual helps and means then any or all the Jesuits in the
world, to be good, sound, constant, and firmly confirmed in virtue: yet none
denies but in matters of life and manners, he may be an evil man (the
catholic faith and belief of his holiness freedom from error, being only
in matters of faith, and Vt est Petrus,) yea if this were so, scz. incredible:
that such horrible crimes should be committed by the Jesuits: then follows it
withal, that they want freewill, and have not potestatem ad vtrumlibet, but
are like angels confirmed in grace, and so by consequent must they be saints in
heaven: whose ghosts or spirits walk here amongst us. For otherwise it
implicates a contradiction: Saint Augustines sentence standing infringible,
allowed of by common consent of doctrine: that there is no sin committed in
the world, or ever has been, but I or he, or she, or any humane mortal wight
may commit the like, be it as horrible, loathsome and unnatural seeming,
against the course of kind as can be imagined. This therefore is peoples
error, put into their heads by these new illuminates. Secondly, it is but an
accustomed coggerie of the Jesuits, to make these books and writings against
them seem odious, and such a deed as never was done before: their drift
therein being only to continue their credit with the laity; to increase the
contempt had in all men of the seculars: and to perfect their mischievous
platform cast for the destruction of their prince and country thereby: which
drift of theirs, may easily be perceived of any half witted body that does but
consider, that if such things may be, and that the Jesuits be men, and
therefore frail, and as subject to fall into sin as others are: then sure it
cannot be otherwise chosen but that they are guilty of all these crimes laid
to their charge, and knowing not in all the world how to excuse or defend
themselves if it come to trial (the seculars urging so vehemently as they do:)
they have no other shift but to stop the peoples ears, eyes, and understanding
from coming to the knowledge of these matters. Which stoppage can be by no
other means then to make these books and writings set out to discover them to
be holden for infamous libels, and Satyricall inuectiues: neither to be read
nor answered. And this is a second false surmise or coggerie of the Jesuits, to
keep the ignorant in error. Thirdly, whosoever shall read and examine these
10. Quodlibets, and other books written against the Jesuits from point to
point, shall find, that there is no such detraction, slander, or bitter speech
used as they talk of, nor so much as perhaps were necessary to discover as the
case stands: (for that the particulars of any one man's private life and actions
as they are private, with correspondencie had to the general or common cause,
are not as yet touched) but the cause so handled agreeing to the diversity of
men, matter, time and place, discussed of in these Interrogatories, so, as the
answer may pass current and apparent, covertly, exactly, disioyntly without
either interruption of justice, on the one side violated by concealing things
necessary to be made known for clearing of the innocent (fiat enim iustita and
ruant caeli) or without breach of charity on the other side hindered by
revealing of secret faults of any one impertinent to the manifestation of what
ingenerall is intended. And here I account the secret faults which are
needless or not at all to be opened, to be whoredom, drunkenness, robbery on
the high way, or in secret burghlary and the like offenses: which come of
passion or frailty of man. And again, I account these public, common, or
general faults, though committed by private persons, which rise of pride,
ambition, etc. may either endanger the church or commonwealth, or hinder the
common cause, by taking away the life of any public person: or advancing any
one to hinder the same: or finally be the cause directly, or indirectly, of
leading ignorant people into error, or misconceit: contrary to the doctrine
of the catholic church, and resolute belief of every obedient child and
member of the same. And of this latter kind are the detractions and defamations
(if any be) against the Jesuits, which every catholic priest is bound unto to
make things known: and every loyal subject and dutiful child, is to take
notice thereof: for avoiding their own danger both of body and soul.
Therefore must it needs follow, that forasmuch as a libell or inuectiue imports
a calumniation or slander against any or many, public or private persons, upon
a special and peculiar intent, either of revenge or preferring a private
faction or action, in opposition against a public cause: the matter here
handled, and the wrong done, being no private hurt, but a public harm, no
sole foul danger, but a commonwealth damage; no individual action of the
person, but a specificall or rather genericall faction of the case that is
here in request amongst us, on the behalf of the catholic church in
general: and our native country, together with all other commonwealths: * It
may not be left, nor accounted of, as a libelling against the seditious Jesuits
and their private faction: but turning back the devils malice upon himself,
and their slanders of the innocent upon their own heads: I conclude that as
the relinquishing of the Jesuits for Pharisees and conspirators against God and
their country (as they are) were the safest way for all catholics,
schismatiks, or other of their and the Puritanes fautors: so were it also the
Jesuits best course to avoid the land, and those pure spirited children of
theirs that will come now at no seculars, nor much less hereafter, (if they
ever depart) it were best for them to be packing with them, and make trial
what will be the end of them both, if they delight so much as it seems they
do in novelties and change: and when they are all gone, and the great new
Abbot with them: or whether they be all exiled and banished the land or no,
(which were great pity but they should) let them know this: that the Church
of God has no need of any of them, and the commonwealth much less: as both
being now so pestered with them as a greater security could not come to either
state Ecclesiastical or temporal, then to concur by one consent utterly to
expel them the land. And although it greeues my very heart to think, that so
many virtuous and truly sincere catholics and religious men and women are
deluded by their Pharisaicall life so much, as greatly it is to be feared
(because greatly (if it happen) to be lamented) that if they should fall into
manifest Apostasy or open rebellion (as they are in a great forwardness to
both) or any other execrable error: these fondlings would follow them even into
hell mouth, spite of priest or pope himself, so vainly are many persuaded of
them. Yet false prophets shall they prove, and so let them trust unto it: as a
general received verity of all true catholics throughout the world; and flat
heresy to defend the contrary that shall dare presume to affirm the fall and
stand of the catholic church, faith, and religion, to depend upon them: No,
no, if every one of their brokers were a professed Jesuit: and every professed
Jesuit a provincial over a 1000. Rectors: and every Rector had under him
10000. ministers: and every minister so many nouices: and every nouice a
Parsonian spirit: and after all this if the proud gates of infernal dungeons
were broken up, and that they had all the helps out of Stix, Corceris, and
Fligiton, that old satanas Segnior Belzebuh Don Lucifer, or Damp. Bemoth could
afford them: yet neither should they neither could they ever prevail against
the impregnable rock, which standing post alone, would split them all one
after another.

THE VIII. ARTICLE.
Whether was it of secret intelligence given from some of the Lords of the
Counsel, or did it rise only of a Jesuitical Machiuillian devise; that
catholics should have such a jealousy and fear, as many seem to have (least
these proceedings of certain secular priests against the Jesuits, together
with the extraordinary intercourse betwixt them and the State) be like to
occasionate all the said catholics overthrow heretofore or not.

THE ANSWER.
IT was spoken of late, as from a Lady of high renown, to one of her women in
her bed chamber (but I will not say the Countess spoke it, because her woman
not her Lady was Iesuited, and therefore likely to be a plot of her ghostly
fathers; fathered upon her honorable Mistres) that neither her Majesty, nor
the Lords of her Highness honorable Counsel meant any more good or scant so
much to the seculars as to the Jesuits: but only for the time present to get
out of the seculars being but simple men, what they could by this means: and
first set them forward to work out the Jesuits, and then to pick a quarrel
at the said seculars to make them all away etc. Which words smell so rank of
a Jesuitical breath, as they can not be imagined to come of any other spirit.
First, for the great indignity included in them to regal Majesty, especially
against our dread Sovereign and honorable Counsel, as to impute unto them, so
cruel and never heard of the like tyranny to massacre the innocent: who
laboring wholly for her Majesty's realms safety, desire nothing to themselves,
but an abject quiet in a frownd on state. Secondly, for the accustomed
arrogancy of a Jesuitical spirit: in that, in contempt of priesthood and all
seculars: they would impute this danger to come as their manner is by reason of
the seculars want of experience, etc. Thirdly, be it so: (as it were too to
prejudicial presumptuous and saucie a part for any subject especially living
in like to this of our frownd on state, to cause any such jealousy to be had
of their Sovereign and honorable Counsel) that no good were meant, but hard
measure intended to be offered to the innocent by shedding of guiltless blood,
adding affliction to affliction, and so increasing all our miseries by this
small comfort of liberty granted to some few particulars: yet three
commodities would ensue hereof which now we al do want: one is that we should
then suffer but one kind of persecution, whereas now we suffer two at once,
the Jesuits tongue torments being more cruel and heavy unto us then our
adversaries racks, ropes, or Tiburne tippets: an other is, that if we may by
means of his holiness command get riddance of the Jesuits hence out of the
land, and an absolute confinde liberty granted to all catholic prisoners, we
should not then fear to die of famine, which now many are very like shortly to
die of unless her Majesty take pity of them even of her innate princely
disposition, and of her mere mercy: all that be in Framlingham castle ready
to starve already as receiving no maintenance nor relief of the common
benevolence. And a third (but not the least) is an assured hope, that by such a
means al should die glorious martyrs, as freed from those factious seditions,
and traiterous dispositions, wherewith Parsons that traitor attainted, has
brought all to be had in jealousy. And sure if it were for none other cause,
yet were this alone sufficient to move all catholics to urge the Jesuits
exile out of the land: that our adversaries might hereafter have no excuse in
putting any to death for religion under pretense as now caeteris paribus,
considering the occasions by some given (whereof we will treat in the next
Quodlibet of State) they have had just cause to prosecute all alike, not
knowing who was innocent of state matters and conspiracies, and who was free.
Therefore do I conclude, that this speech is but a mere coggerie and
Machiuillian devise of the Jesuits faction to break of this intercourse, and
clearly to take away all means of liberty to any seculars or other
catholics that is not for their tooth to the uttermost.

THE IX. ARTICLE.
Whether any assurance or hope be of the conversion of our country by this
course taken by the seculars sooner then by that the Jesuits take, all this
while; the Jesuits affirming, that all that they do or intend against their
country proceeds of pure zeal and mere intent and meaning they have, to set
forth Gods glory: And by consequent though some are possessed with
Machiuillian devises on their side, for to serve their own private turns
withal: and others perhaps on the seculars to serve themselves also: yet
forasmuch as all in both or either company are not of one humor nor mind in the
particulars; then (holding them for a faction for the present, the seculars for
their country, the Jesuits for Spain) whether the contention in general be
not, or at least may be thought to proceed of true zeal to the glory of God
and spiritual good of their country or not: and how their intents (being many
of both parties in general, very virtuous, wise, learned, and discreet men,
yea and no doubt but far from treason or conspiracies in themselves howsoever,
they are or may be corrupted in virtute principalis agentis) may be interpreted
in seeking the one party for conversion of their country by invasion and
possessing of the land with strangers: The other with apostolical manner and
accustomed course of preaching, teaching, martyrdom etc.

THE ANSWER.
THis article containing sundry interrogatories, represents a memorable
discourse I once did read in Sir Anthony Guiueraes writings. Which for that it
may fitly be applied to our purpose concerning this contention betwixt the
seculars and Jesuits, I will first set it down at large to the same effect he
has left it to posterity to look upon, and then apply it to our particular
case and cause. The sum of his speech consists of this point, to wit: how
that the contention, which amongst the wicked is naught as proceeding of
rancor, malice and revenge: the same amongst the good and otherwise sincerely
virtuous, is commendable: as proceeding of zeal, true piety and perfect
charity even in the midst of their heart breaking broiles. The sequel
ensuing upon his speech is this: that if there have been in heaven high
ambition; in paradise too much curiosity; in the Apostles school, a
contentious desire of sovereignty; in the indubitate seat of infallible
truth, three and twenty schisms already past, sometimes two, otherwhile three
Popes (though but one Summus pontifex and he holy and Peter) in opposition by
different elections one against an other, and so continuing the schism 3. 7.
20. 30. 40. 50. years together (some lucidum interuallum passing now and then
between) ere it was ended: Emperors and kings and the mighties of the world
interchangeably standing in a faction now with one, then with an other,
sometimes with most infest wars, yea cruel deaths of the vanquished
Antipapes, and perturbers of the Churches peace, which with all those
tempestuous stormy blasts could not be blown up nor fail in faith, standing
the oracle irreprooueable, ego rogaui pro te Petre vt non deficiat fides tua
etc. Then neither is it to be wondered at in these contentions: if some wicked
Jesuits of Luciferian ambition, Euauistian curiosity, Iudastiall desire of
gain and contempt of ordinary authority, stir up strife, cause rebellion,
and make inuouations of ancient customs and new gods amongst the people: set
up an Antipape, golden calfe, or Archpriest, and commit all impiety under
color of religion: and yet with Core, Dathan and Abiram saucily presume to
tell both Moses and Aaron, Pope and Prince, state ecclesiastical and
temporal, that they take too much upon them: nay that they are seditious,
disobedient and factious that speak against them for so doing, and that they
are but trifles, which they make so much ado about. Neither is it to be
judged, that all have dipped their hands a like deep in these contentions, or
intentions on the Jesuits side: though all alike dangerous (that concur with
them, or are agents for them, as I said before) both to the Church and common
wealth (by reason of the aid and furtherance of the conspirators and
principal agents, which in this case they yield) in the intent of the
plot-casters; to the overthrow of all government, religion and authority; but
in their own intent (at least in many of them) to the setting up of religion
again in our country simply and plainly: some of them no doubt, thinking it
impossible to be brought to pass, but by invasion and conquest of the land:
and this only by false persuasions of the Jesuits: whose intents many devout
both men and women thinking to be sincere, good, just and conformable to the
laws both of God and the catholic Church; do hereupon prosecute their
purpose, as being led away with indiscreete zeal. Of this sort of catholics
then is the question here to be made: Whether their course (supposing one or
two Jesuits be of that mind, and go no further gaping after gain, honor or
renown, which Parsons and other of their chief ambitious practitionall state
Jesuits aim at) or the seculars course be of more assurance for the conversion
of our country: which of them is most conformable to catholic doctrine and
belief: and what examples can be brought on either side. This is the point I
now stand upon: and the effect of the Spanish Bishops and cronicle before
mentioned, tends to this end in form following.

Amongst the many visions which good Daniell had: one was of the two guardian
angels of the Hebrews empire and the Persian monarchy, two nations vowed
enemies one to the other: the former being transported by the latter, and led
captive out of Babylon into Susan, in change of the conquerors imperial place
and regal throne. In this Babylonian transmigration Daniels Hebdomades
beginning to take their place in working in the heart of Cyrus for delivery of
Gods people out of captivity: a question rose and thereupon a great contention
followed with hot disputes amongst the heavenly spirits: concerning the Jews
delivery out of bondage, scil. whether it were more fitting to Gods glory to
move the Persian heart to grace and favor at the suite of Daniell to send home
his countrymen in peace and quiet, or otherwise to harden his and Darius his
heart, to yield to no release: but that for ever they should there condemned,
despised and dispersed remain. In this heroical disputation (the moderators,
wherein no doubt were full replete with no less Cherubinicall knowledge then
Seraphical zeal) the three great princes Michael, Raphael and Vriel with the
rest of the Regents and governors deputed to the Hebrews monarchy, or twelve
tribes of Israel taking part with the Jew and Daniell: and the prince of the
Persian kingdom (who had resisted Daniell 21. days) together with all the
Lords, protectors, guardians and governors of Mede, of Perse, of Chaldaea, of
Babylon, and of all the Asiacke monarchy vsque and vltra Garamantes and Indos,
taking the parts of the Gentiles, and defending those people, princes, and
nations over whom by Gods merciful designment they had the protection,
government and charge of patronage: Thus began the plea.

The guardians of the frontires of Palestine alleged how all that rich
country a fructu frumenti, vini and olet multiplicata, and abounding with
milk and honey in former ages: was now become desert, wild, laid waste, to
sack and spoil with robbers and thieves: having no rep^^^e of God nor good
Saint: no soul in that soil but now di^ p^r^sh. Whereas before out of every
tribe there past yearly sundry deuo^re souls thence, into Abraham's bosom to
be in a readiness at th M^ss^^ his return into heaven: Therefore was it
necessary that Z ^^ch (...) Esdras, that Nehemias and others of the Jews,
priest^, Levites, prophet^ and scribes, with the whole multitude: should be
delivered, to replenish these provinces with Gods people again. To this was
answered by the Gentiles generals and captains: that forasmuch as
Nabuchodonosor, as Baltasar, as Darius, as Xerxes, and other monarchs by
secret instinct and often good motions put into their hearts by commission given
unto them from their heavens king, had of their princely benignity granted
unto the Jews (after trial made of their constancy, and that their God
fought for them in the cause of religion and sacrifice) a free liberty of
conscience to serve their Lord God, agreeing to their Jewish rites, and that
even Daniell who was so desirous to have his people sent home, was in as high
authority, grace and favor with those Ethnicke princes, as any noble of their
own sect in the court and country where they and he together lived: therefore
was that argument for the Palestian empire of no validity: seeing it is not
the soil but the soul, which God respects, and whereof they all have
charge; and thar no humane wight be he Jew, Gentile or Proselite, Christian,
Infidel or Catechumene (but has his good Angel appointed to protect him at
his first entrance into the worlds vale of miseries, and is bound to continue
with him, accompanying him where ever he goes so long as he or she remains in
this territory of tears. Then the guardian of Jerusalem and principal of
Judea (S. Michaell as it seemed) replied and said: that though it were the men
which lived in the world, and not the world it self which they all had charge
of in chief: yet because man came of earth, and in Salem city was Adam our
protoplast created: therefore was the prerogative royal given to Iebus land to
be called Terra sancta for ever after. The language also which Adam first did
speak, and which after some two thousand years continuance of that only and
no more throughout the world remaining uncorrupted, as destinated to the
posterity of Heber: in the time of Phaleg amongst 72. distinct tongues (cast
amongst the Nimrodian rebels in the tower of Babell) coming by lineall descent
to be called Hebrew after the division made: was the same which Moses, which
Samuel, which Solomon, which David with all the Jews legifers, used in their
scriptures, codes, law books, prophecies, and other writings, and this tongue
of all others is only called Lingua sancta. Moreover, the people of this
nation, Jews borne, and none but they are called Gens sancta, populus electus,
regale sacerdotium: by right of inheritance even from Adam, from Noe, from
Abraham, from Israel, from David by lineall succession in a downright line.
And although their ancestors lived in bondage 400. years space under the
Egyptian Pharaos: during which time seven mighty nations of sundry warlike
people (whereof the chief being Cananites, gave the name to the whole land)
inhabited over all, yet did not that discontinuance any whit disable their
rightful title and claim, but that at time convenient by Gods appointment to
the number of 1300000. and above, past over the red sea, leaving not one
Israelite behind them in Egypt, and under the conduct of Moses and Duke
Iosue, victorious over thirty kings and kingdoms, besides other states, this
sacred nation possessed this holy land, the holy language still preserved
amongst them. So as even to these countries, kingdoms, and provinces has God
assigned his Angels protectors of his people therein, and by consequent in rigor
of his justice the Jews ought to return into the kingdom of Jury and
Jerusalem again.

With this answer was not the Angel of Perse contented: but held on his plea
on the Gentiles side: affirming, that, as it was for their sins, that God in
his justice had rejected Israells issue, so, although it pleased him to
manifest his omnipotent power and Majesty that man might say: non in carneo
brachio corroborabitur vir, and that there was no God, but the Lord God of
Israel alone: yet was not his mercy so tied to their sleeue, as after so many
signs, tokens, prodigious woonders, and miracles showed for their sakes in
open sight of all their enemies, as amongst the Egyptians (before named) the
Philistines, the Tyrians, the Moabites, the Ammonites, the Edomites and all
other nations round about them, he should still forgive and forget to punish
them, agreeing to their demerits as hitherto he had: but that the destinies of
their days drawing to an end, the fatal web of their woes being at hand, and
the period of their time now approaching? there was no expectation to be had of
their return, nor in rigor of justice, any motion to be made on that behalf.
And even Daniell, Ezechiell, Jeremy, and the rest of the prophets do know
that the quadrupart monarchy began in Babylon under Nabuchodonosor, which
shall continue to the end, by translation from the Chaldeis to the Medes and
Persians as now it is, and from them to the stout, inuicted Macedonian Greek:
from whom by revolution af time it shall descend to the Romans sacred Senate:
and whosoever be the monarchy: under that prince, power and potentate, shall
the Jews captives live. Therefore the holiness of the land, the sanctity of
the tongue, the purity of the people: the sacred unction of the priest: is not
to be named when it comes to pleading of Gods justice and man's deserts. Heaven
was ever a holier place then earth, the land of Eden far before Palestine,
Paradise terrestrial always to be preferred before Jerusalem: and yet out of
these have our fellow Angels and Isreal's ancestors, man's protophlast: both been
thrust out with infliction of perpetual exile out of heaven upon the former,
and an inhibition to the latter never to return into the country of Eden, nor
garden of Paradise again: and then a simili; no reason of their return home
to the land of behest hereafter, nor to account them Gods people, the (...)
Nation, and the like: more then any other inhabitants upon the (...) the middle
earth: seeing all are one by creation, as come of one man Adam: all one by
preservation; (as, we are appointed to guarde the Persians, with as tender care
over them, as you have over the Jews and so has every guardian Angel over
that country and people allotted to his custody;) all one by Synderisis and
instinct of proper kind (as inclined to seek for good to eschew evil, and
wishing after summum bonum, if in paris naturalibus they could have obtained
it) and all one by relation betwixt the D. attributes and man's deserts on Gods
part: as one qui neminem vult perire, sed omnes animas saluas facere as well
Gentile as Jew or proselite.

Yet for all this an other Angel replied, and it was our blessed Ladies
paranimphe Saint Gabriell as may be well coniectured because Daniell says that
this holy spirit appeered unto him from the beginning, and told him of things
to come toward the end of the world, what should happen in these latter days
and how the Septuaginta Hebdomades were abbreuiated over his people and over
the holy city meaning Jerusalem. This Archangell then revived the plea on the
Jews behalf: that needs they must return to Jerusalem again to repair
the holy City, to restore the Temple, to reinstall their high priest to
consecrate the altar to anoint the holy of holies, to purge the place of
sacrifice polluted by the Gentiles, and to exercise their many ceremonies,
sacraments, and sacrifices which were not to be used, made or offered extra
ciuitatem sanctam Jerusalem, and because that after 62. weeks (understand 8.
Hebdomads to be first ended in time of this altercation, and despicion amongst
the Angels) occidetur Christus: therefore to confirm what God has promised by
his Angels speaking in the mouth of his prophets: the Jews of necessity must
return again, that God may be glorified, his church flourish, and his priests
offer sacrifice unto him in the place appointed them. But to this roundly and
readily Malachies Angel made answer agreeing to the mind of the Persians
guardian: that as he had said, so true it was: that non est personarum acceptio
apud Deum, but that who, when, and in what place soever the name of God shall
be called upon, there, then, and by that same person shall his name be
glorified. And for the particulars: Jerusalem in deed was the holy city, and
so it should be counted to the worlds end, not for that Adam was therein
created, lived, died, and his scul buried in mount Caluarie: not for that it
was the seat of the holy line deuoluted from Adam to Christ: not for that the
law, the prophets, the sacrifice, and the high priests gave the prerogatives of
all sanctity and holiness to this place before any other: But that which made
that land holy, that people holy, that line holy, that city holy, was: because
the holy of all holies Christ Jesus the son of God, and Mary the immaculate
tressacred blessed virgin, came out of that line, lived in that land, was
linked in blood to that people, by the two tribes of Judah and Leui, kings and
priests: watered many a house with his tears, and sanctified that city with
his own most precious blood, imbruing the streets, earth and stones from
Pilats palace to Caiphas his place, and from thence to the Caluarian mount
without the gates of the city. Whose personal birth, life and death, as they
left an inestimable sanctity behind them to that land: so the Jews wilfully
depriving themselves of so inualuable a price as he paid for man's redemption,
have woorthily deserved an utter extirpation of their race, a subversion of
their state, and a captivity, bondage, and slavery of themselves and their
posterity for ever. And although there had been and were during the time of
captivity many holy, religious and devout men and women amongst them: yet not
only because the greatest part of the multitude and sundry of their kings,
princes and governors had offended their Lord God in the highest degree, which
is in schism, heresy, and apostasy, with idolatry, so highly displeasing
the divine majesty, as the punishment of those vices has always been this:
videl. a conquest of the land, a downfall of nobility, a desolation of the
state, a deflowring of their virgins, a dishonoring of their wives, a massacre
of their ancients, a population of the common wealth, and a servile life to all
their youth, led captives out of their native land. But withal (as the Persian
had said) because the providence in appointing of Guardians for every province,
prince, people and particular person, had been in vain and to no purpose; if
God should for ever withdraw his mercy from all, save only those of his own
flesh and blood, as he was a Jew borne: and if our Jews prophets spoke in
general, when they said, that: Deus non vult mortem peccatoris, sed magis vt
conuertatur and viuat: then can it be no otherwise, but that the Hebrews,
Israelites and Jews having continued these three thousand and od hundreds of
years, under one kind of true worship of our Lord God, the only visible
Church, true faith, sacrifice and religion remaining inuiolate amongst them
alone; reason does convince on the part of man, and mercy and justice on Gods
behalf, does ratify and confirm the argument to be good, lawful and
expedient: that the Jews should be dispersed before the Messiah come, into so
many nations, provinces and kingdoms of the Gentiles, as his holy will is to
have partakers of his merits. And all this to the end that the Gentiles being
by creation in God himself, and preservation, in the power of his angels: his
own people as well as they, living now in darkness overwhelmed with ignorance,
and given over unto profane idolatry, might by this their conuersing and
familiar living amongst them, come to have some knowledge of their end, that
there is another world after this: and that they are to acknowledge, honor, and
latrially adore but one God alone. That this was the meaning of the holy Ghost
Malachies (...) corrupt heretics: The former constantly expecting Gods just
designments in these causes allege that they come as Apostles of their
country, whose peculiar property is to convert souls, by suffering their
own blood to be shed, not in procuring the shedding of any others ( Sanguis
enim martyrum est semen ecclesiae, as all do grant it, and experience of all
ages has approved it true:) the latter not for that surceasing, excepts
against heretics in such proceedings: who by authority of holy writ may
justly be constrained with force of the temporal sword, to receive the faith
of Christ and his catholic Roman Church, wherein they were baptized, and out
of which they are now most pernitiously fallen to their damnation, To this the
former again makes reply: that that is in a case of law and strategeme of
wars, when the plaintiff as a sovereign having right on his side, may have
strength and power at hand sufficient to defend his just quarrel, and Gods
cause: but where and when the poor afflicted catholics are the weaker part
and in subjection under their native prince, they must not tempt God with
miracles, sed in patientia possidebunt animas suas, expecting the time that God
has appointed either to ease the afflicted of their heavy persecution, by
calling them to his mercy, or else to move the adversary, as here he did
king Cyrus etc. Here again the latter does urge very vehemently against the
former, that it is their fault if they be not of strength enough. For if all
would side one way, run one course, join together of one part, they were able
to match their adversaries at all assaies: but because they favor heretics,
and their titles more then catholics: as some the Scots king: others the house
of Derbie: others that of Huntington, others of Hartford, and others the Lady
Arbella etc. therefore is Gods cause weakened, and the catholics quarrel
quailed. But to this yet again the former makes reioinder, professing, that if
they had millions on their side for thousands on her majesty's: yet they hold,
it were not lawful for them by force of arms to gain the garland that they
run for (as afterward it shall appear) and utterly denying that they favor any
heretic as an heretic, or their titles under that pretense: but as remembering
how diverse princes and great monarchs have been converted to the catholic
Christian faith, and withal considering, that neither the king of Scots, nor
yet any of the rest were ever any special persecutors of us or our religion:
but rather favorable to many catholics as is well known: not forgetting this
besides, that it were an act of injustice (in us especially being private
persons) either to manage a false title (as the Spaniard has none other) or
impugn a known right, as all the world knows it rests confined within the
Albion i will.

But admit it were revealed to any private man that the Spanyard or any other
foreign prince should prevail and carry away our English crown out of the
land: so as we should never have king regnant over us hereafter: as some old
prophecies (many say) have foreshewed, that our dear countrymen, brothers
sisters and friends; the flower of Englands youth, the beauty of our Ladies,
Widows, Wives, Virgins, of all degrees should be prostituted, profaned,
ravished, and led captive into strange lands (the sore persecution of Gods
servants, the blasphemies, heresies, execrable schisms of this age, and our
own sins in general urging Gods wrath against our whole Nation to take so
sharp, yet ordinary revenge for such offenses) as some say also has been
spoken of long agone to come to pass in this our unfortunate age: or that we
should have such a change of state government, common wealth and all, as the
chief sovereignty should be in an alien prince, Spanyard or Burgundian,
Netherlandian or the like: and the Lords spiritual and temporal governing
over us for the time to be of that foraigne prince his Nation, and the Jesuits
or fathers (as they term themselves) of the society to be their Interpretors
for our English, Welsh, Irish and Stots nation, as both letters, and witnesses,
besides invincible probats otherwise are extant to show: that Master Parsons
and his confederates go about such a matter: and a sermon, himself once made
at Rome insinuates no less, but that by tyrannical subiecting the Seminary
there to be under his society; he expounded the prophecy (he there spoke of)
in his intent and meaning, to be directly understood of himself and his
company: that they should be those long gowns which should reign and govern
the whole Isle of great Britain. Of which society there being some of all, or
the most part of all Christian Nations, having once this land given them by and
under the Spaniard as they hope for to make it a Iapponian Island of Jesuits
(but stay, they have not yet Iapponia in their hands) then should we have as
many languages in this Isle, and the ancient Inhabitants dispersed into as
many countries, as there should be prouincialls of that society: for it were
no policy to let us all live here together nor yet lead all captive into one
province or kingdom. Yet let God work his will in these things: be it true or
false that any such heaviness be revealed, what then? Shall I therefore be the
bloody instrument to work it of mine own head: without Gods special
designement so to do? Shall I show my self so unnatural, inhumane and cruel
hearted as to write books, to persuade, to use all possible means to bring my
native country into bondage and slavery? Shall I of a grudge or desire of
revenge upon some particular person or persons, or for some private gain to my
self or my own peculiar company, banish from my hard, nay stony, nay
flintie, nay adamantine heart, all pity, compassion, charity, remorse and
natural affection to that which next to my maker and his spouse, I am by all
laws in chieefe to esteem of: the bond of love, loyalty and duty being
greater to my prince and country, then to my parents or dearest friends? And
whereas even tyrants in such like cases have been moved to lenity: shall I
have no conceit of the wringing of hands, of the sighs and tears, of the
weepings and wailings, of the skrikes and cries, of so many sweet, young and
tender babes of both sexes? Shall I have no feeling of so many mothers bleeding
hearts: of so many noble ladies, and other young maids of generous birth,
gentle blood and free education, for all rare parts, indowments and abilities
of nature and fortune fit to be princes peers, now to be left desolate, or
bestowed on every base fellow, not worthy to be their servant? Shall I take
upon me to be an actor, an orator, or a broker in laboring to bring that old
blind prophecy to effect, which says, When the black fleet of Norway is
come and gone, then lords shall wed ladies and bring them home? Shall I be the
efficient isntrumental cause or causa sine qua non, of so many great,
worshipful, honorable and princely heirs, to be disinherited, of so many
vpstart squibs of foreign nations to start up in their places, of so many
false textes, forged glosses, fained laws of God, of nature, and of man; to
disprooue all titlet, customs and ancient rights of birth and blood, to lands,
liuelyhoods, and other inheritances, and make them of no validity: but that
every one of most might may lawfully possess what they may lay hands on,
dispossess the old tenant, yea ancient inhabitants at their pleasure, and
dispose of goods, lands, and inheritances as they think good? For admit that a
crown and kingdom may be thus handled (as Master Parsons in his book of
succession affirms they may) then a fortiori, all other fee simples, fee
tails, frank almaines, or what other estate soever is most sure, being
depending of a kingdom, and subject to a crown, are of no force, effect,
worth or value, more then an ordinary tenant at will has of his farm,
bartin or cottage. It was oracled from those divine lips (to which it were
blasphemy to impute any possibility of a lie) that necesse est vt haereses:
and in another place vt scandalum veniat: But to this necessity was given such
a gird, as might even have made a reprobate appalde to think, that the evil
which of necessity must come to pass, should be acted by his unfortunate
plottings. For vae homini illi was straightwaies added to the definitive
sentence per quem scandalum venit, as far better and more tolerable to have had
a millstone tied about his neck, and himself bound hand and foot, cast
headlong into the sea, rather then ever to have been author, agent, plotcaster,
current or contriuer to so great a sin.

Parsons is that wretch to whom with his Jesuitical plotcasters of faction,
this speech of scandal is applied. If he therefore have thus far meddled (and
further, as in more particular manner shall in the next Quodlibet be showed) by
his seditious libels, practices and conspiracies against the English state: if
all men judge these unchristian, unnatural, uncharitable dealings of his, to
have occasioned such a general jealousy to be had of all priests and catholic
recusants: as the sequel thereof presageth a ruin, subversion, conquest,
captivity and bondage of our dear country, native land, people, nation and
friends: were it not that God of his mercy (in whose hands are the hearts of
princes) had inclined her Majesty's princely heart to conceive of her poor
catholics so, as not to condemn all for some private men's attempts and
practices: which, if any thing prevent these general ensuing calamities to the
whole realm, it must be that, or nothing else at all: the whole state being
otherwise brought into such jealousy of one the other by Parsons agents, as
all and every of them, of necessity constraind, must seek for their security
to make friends where and as best they may: if he the said Parsons have taken
upon him to promulgate these prodigies, to foreshew our ensuing calamities to
be the genius of his own and all our hard fortunes, and to make known to all
nations, the enormous dealings of private persons under our sovereign (still
concealing his own and his associats) and to stir up, yea put foreign powers
in hope of a conquest, nay full assurance of a rightful title to our English
crown: if he in his books, in his platformes, in his secret persuasions in
his agents tongue works, will labor to make all our royal and imperial
heroical princes, our nobles, our gentiles, our commons, and the whole realm
odious; by reason of some private and particular persons offenses: if he will
seek to confederate himself in a Spanish or Jesuitical league, with those,
against whom he has written most bitterly, and showed by demonstration, that
all the realm (in his judgment and censure) has just cause to curse, hate,
and spit at them: if he have offered himself like an impudent base fellow, to
be a spy (to color thereby his treason) for her Majesty, to fill all the
whole realm with state practisioners, to tamper one while with this noble
Heroes; another while with that royal lady: and get by his agents some or
other of his Jesuitical tribe and consistorian order, to insinuate his drift
every where: If by his means there be not one noble family in this land, but
the Jesuits have been tampering withal to come within it one way or other: the
nobles themselves both Lords and Ladies often dreaming of nothing less, then
that any of a Jesuitical faction came within their doors, or sat at table
with them: much less that so smooth a creeper into their bosom intended to
sting them at the heart, at time appointed for their purpose: neither the
Marquisate of Winchester, nor the house of Oxford (for as for the house of
Arundell, Westmerland and Northumberland, how he and his associats have
tampered with them all the world knows, especially the first, against which
notwithstanding he has written most bitterly in Philopater and other books,
affirming the unfortunate Howard of Norfolk, to have been one and the chief
cause of the overthrow both of the Church and common wealth, yet with whom he,
and his has had (I will not say have videant ipsi) more inward and close
dealing for advancement to the crown by marriage of Lady Arbella etc. and
other means then with any other house and family within the land) nor the
house of Lincoln, nor the houses of Cumberland, of Shrewsbury, of Penbrooke,
of Darby, of Hartford, of Huntington, of Warwike, of Leicester, of Worcester,
of Bathe, of Kent, of Sussex, of Nottingham, of Mountague etc. together with
all and every of the nobles and Barons of this land: none I say has been free
from danger of intrapping of whatsoever religion they were, by some one fine
fingerd fig boy, or other cousin of his kind: always observing this for a
general rule, that look where any of the blood royal ly most; there and in
those places are the Jesuits most frequent, and their faction is hottest: so in
London, in Derbyshire, and (whiles Earl Ferdinando lived) in Lancashire,
though God be thanked, there are not so many of that faction there now as erst
have been etc. Finally, if he in all his said Philopater and elsewhere, have
showed what miserable ends those Archmurtherers of the Church and common
wealth, have made together with their posterity, before the fourth generation
has been past: if he have presumed to accommodate these examples to our
countries nobles, and taken upon him the person of a wise man, southsaier, or
prophet to foretell a sorrowful visitation of our nobility with like
misfortunes: if they that take part with the wicked in their wickedness, must of
equity and reason look to be partakers of their punishments, pains and
miseries: what should I say more? religion mooues me yet much more to speak;
conscience binds me to clear true catholic hearts; zeal of Gods house and
honor constraines me to detect this wicked impe of cursed kind; affection to
my dear country makes me tedious in discourse; love and loyalty, faith and
duty, fear and affection strive for a supremacy in a troubled spirit, and
all resolved into a sea of sadness command me now to a sorrowful silence: and
so concluding this long article, that whatsoever the end of our countries
calamities happen to be for subjection, captivity, bondage, desolation, or the
like: yet if Parsons say and affirm, that they who were the original cause
and occasion, of our heavy and just downfall, be sure to bear the greatest
burden, and to abide the sorest trial: if he have been that unfortunate Saians
jade, upon whom, whosoever has sitten, have come to a sorrowful and wretched
end, as all his tampering platformes with this and that noble, have declared:
if he have hitherto ever joined most with those whom himself has ever judged
most unfortunate, and justly to have merited these plagues which he threateneth
on Gods behalf to fall upon them and their posterity: Then what mad man or
woman is he or she, that to second his own sorrows, will consort him or her
self with the Jesuitical faction, to side with those of whom their
Polypragmon has prophesied the destruction? Therefore happy say I is he or
she, that setting all private respects aside for their own gain, seek the
conversion of their country as the seculars do. For that although there
neither is, neither can there be any assurance of either side, to wit: whether
ever our country shall be again converted all wholly to the catholic faith or
no, either by secular or Jesuit, or any other: yet more hope questionles there
is of conversion of it by the seculars, then by the Jesuits course, because the
seculars is more apostolical and directly tending to the preservation of all
etc.

THE X. ARTICLE.
Whether any certainty or possibility of conversion of any of the Lords of
her Majesty's honorable Counsel, or other magistrates or officers in special
authority under her highness, whom the seculars deal withal: and if none,
then whether they may trust them in other matters and proceedings, as D.
Bagshaw, M. Bluett and others do or no, without offense, scandal or other
danger either to themselves or their friends.

THE ANSWER.
THis question is sufficiently debated before, to wit: That although all or any
one appointed by her Majesty to deal in these affairs meant fraudulently and
with intent to entrap the seculars one way or other, to work their greater
discredit disgrace and utter overthrow thereby (which yet were very
ungrateful, uncivil and inhumane for any so to judge and censure without
cause: for as it is said, it is sin to lie of the devil: and sure this
calumniation and slander raised of these men for their intercourse with those
in authority under her Majesty, declares a most malicious Jesuitical
spirit: there being no question to be made of it to the contrary (because
former examples of other Jesuits have proved it true, and led the seculars
first the dance, in seeking of favors at civil magistrates or others hands)
but that if either Master Blackwel, or Father Garnet, or any Jesuit of them
all that deal now in hucker mucker (and therefore more daungerously and
pernitiously as I said before) might have free access, and either were as
clear in their own conscience as these seculars are, or else might have
imputative justice by conuiuence from her Majesty on their side to obtain so
much favor by, as these have obtained: there is not the purest of them but
would come with his hat in his hand to the Bishop of London, or to any other in
authority for to be shrouded under them: and so by consequent to ingrate thus
injuriously both upon her Majesty's officers and the secular priests as the
Jesuits do (because they have not the like favor) deserves the challenge to
a combat if they were other men then they are: yet howsoever (although as I
said) there were evil intended, seeing notwithstanding that there is no way
possible to work any evil to the seculars or their friends thereby: unless
they count it evil for a man condemned to the gallows to be delivered and set
free and his life granted him: or for him that is condemned in a praemunire, or
otherwise to perpetual prison to be delivered thence: or for him that is in
danger to be searched and ransackt every hour, to have a breathing fit of
safety and security to sleep one week or fortnight a sounder sleep then he
had slept in twenty years before: or for him that has by statute laws
forfeited his life, lands, goods, and all he is worth, to have some mitigation,
and find an ease, not only in pardon of his life, but also in releasement of
the confiscation of his goods and saving of his lands etc. And if any little
ease to languishing hearts be comfortable: if lawful it be for any redimere
iniustam vexationem: if all men be bound to clear themselves and to live
without exasperating of any nor giving offense no not to Infidels: if for these
and the like causes sundry secular priests have upon sufficient approbation and
trial, had of their innocence: found extraordinary favor, and others also by
their means: And if a Sebastian could court it out with his Lord and Emperor,
and yet keep a religious heart to God ward, and help, and save many a man's
life that otherwise had died; if a Daniell could obtain so special favor at
a kings hands, as not only to be delivered out of prison, yea and from out of
the lions den: but also to be made liefetenant general princeps exercitus and
Emperor of the field even amiddest those amongst whom he and all his
countrymen lived captive: If both a Peter and a John could be like dearly
accounted of to their Lord and master Christ, and yet even he who was rather of
the two, yea or most of all the rest in greatest danger, because by his royal
blood and alliance to the king his maker and his master, a just cause of
jealousy was to be had of him: but notwithstanding, this we find, that Saint
John found friendship when and where Saint Peter could not at the high priests
hands, and amongst other inferior officers, and yet none ever spoke against it,
or thought the worse of him for it. Yea if S. Peter (although he had better
have used his friend in another matter, but that it was oracled so to be) used
Saint John's help to come in amongst the thickest of his masters enemies: Then
say I, it is the most envious, malicious and pharisaicall part, that these
proud disdainful sycophants could possibly play, and does as much discover
their vile and base minds as any one thing could possibly do: to malign,
slander, and backbite men of better deserts then themselves. But the devil is
ever envious. An envious man is always murmuring, grudging, and repining at an
others good fortunes: and to hear of a Iesuitical fellow to give a good word
of any that is not Iesuited in faction or affection: he sure by my consent
shall be a king cipher, to command the nine figures in algorisme: with (o)
rare, amongst the rarest illuminates.

So then to the purpose to make an end of this Quodlibet, I say, First, that
there is more assurance, and have been more perfect and true tokens of
constancy wisdom, piety, religion, learning, virtue and government in all
these: whom the Jesuits do most kick at, and spurn against (for familiarity
or intercourse by writing, access, personal parlee, and other means with
those in authority under her Majesty) then in the prowdest spirited Jesuit in
this land whosoever, that may freeliest say: Non sum sicut caeteri homines, nor
like these Publican seculars. Yea neither master Clarke, master Barneby, nor
master Champney (who are the yoongest of these thus extraordinary favored) but
a priestly behavior has merited unto them by their constant sufferance
(before it came to this gracious conniuence to favor them) so reverend a
respective opinion to be had of them by all men, as that their young years
ouer-shadowed with venerable gravity of hoariest hairs, might in their mild
conceits with modest blush, move them to take S. Paul's words to Bishop
Timothy as spoken unto every one of them apart: nemo te contemnat propter,
inuentutem: yea even master Barneby (the yoongest as I take it a most sweet
natured fair conditioned and humble hearted gentleman of good ability) might
well have merited that grace and favor at the Apostles hands. And for the rest
scz. doctor Bagshawe, master Bluet, master Mushe, and master Colington with
others, but those especially had of the Jesuits faction now in chase, I am
fully persuaded that howsoever some surly syres, or mincing outraiers do
scorn and scoff at them behind their backs: yet would their very presence,
countenance, and conversation, put them to silence, or at the least dash them
from ever entering into so contemptuous speeches as now they use against them.
Not one of these four but (being any Jesuits ancient, as a Jesuit in England
this day) they would be judged of all indifferent persons: to be more fit to
govern both master Blackwell and all his puny Fathers, then to be governed of
all or any of them.

Secondly, the Jesuitical arrogancy is most egregious in this point, when
they say, I pray God master Bluet be not overtaken, he trusts and tells the
Bishop of London too much, and doctor Bagshaw he does the like with master
Waade and so others of them: and I pray God they stand says one: and they are
but weak men says another and unfit to deal in such matters: and (O) that
such or such a father had had the managing of the matter: he could and would (I
mary would he) have handled it more substantially, and to the purpose: whereas
like vain glorious Pharisees as they are, many of those of whom they vaunt
most, knew never what imprisonment nor any trial meant: but riding to and fro
in their coaches like Sur-le-boyes, mount-segniors, or other men of state (as
unworthy the name of a Jesuit unless withal a statist) they lie pampering
themselves here and there, surfeiting in sedition, ambition, and deep
disdain: and when they have put on the cap of maintenance amongst their
admirabliers, then they begin to descant upon al men's actions, and fyle their
tongues agreeing to their auditors fancies.

Thirdly, there neither is, neither can be any offense committed or danger
incurd, or scandal given in these favors received: unless it be Jewish,
Pharisaicall (otherwise now rightly called a malicious Jesuitical scandal)
which to refrain from, were the most simple, indiscrete, uncharitable, unjust,
uncivil, and immodest part that ever was played. Therefore let these new
Pharisees, choose whether they will be scandalized or no, it is nothing to the
purpose. For if they find a Haggard ready to bait at every bush, or an
eyeese ready to cry at sight of every cricket, or a scrupulous, tender, and
timorous heart ready to fear offending, in every word he speaks: then have
these master Faulconers that which they look for, these great Burgo-masters
the thing they seek for, and the Jesuitical tribe, their treacherous hearts
desire.

Fourthly, there is no assurance of any one catholics perseverance to the end,
that lives on earth. For who that had seen Lucifer the day star glistring in
excelsis but would have honored him before Saint Michaell the Archangell: and
yet in ictu occuli he became a foul fiend and loathsomest creature to look
upon that ever God created? Who that knew king Solomon to have had the rarest
and chiefest gift that ever was given to man, besides that, the gift of
prophecy: also a more near familiarity with God then I think any Jesuit
dare presume to affirm he ever had: (and yet I cannot tell they are so
arrogant) as for to walk and talk with him (be it mediate or immediate all is
one) face to face: who then that had seen him in his highest pomp, royallest
Majesty, and greatest glory would not have come with the Saban Queen to
admire him and adore him? who that had seen Judas chosen by God himself (who
could not be ignorant of what was in the man) to be a priest, an apostle, yea
and one of the twelve that our Savior chose out of the whole world) but would
have kissed the ground where he went, etc? who of like sort that had heard the
holy Ghost speak it, and consecrate, design and single out seven Deacons:
whereof Nicholas was one, would ever have thought he would have proved a
puritan, or one infected with the family of love, or rather the first beginner
and brocher of the same? who that had read Apollonaris works in 33. huge
volumes against the heretics of his days: would ever have censured or thought
he would in the end have become a rank heretic, yea and a father and author
of most blasphemous heresies? who that had seen the Chanon or Doctor of Paris
living a life irreprehensible of any man, would not have been ready to come
and kissed his feet, gone on pilgrimage to his shrine, or done any worship
unto him on earth, and yet with horror to think of man's heavy state, not one
of these but are known to be condemned, unless it be king Solomon of whom
some doctors doubt, who yet I think would not be in his place for a myriades
of millions of massy gold: ergo qui stat videat ne cadat.

Fifthly, as our stand in Gods church is uncertain, and known only to God
alone: So there is not the hottest of our adversaries in religion, that a man
can say or justify and bide by it: that it is impossible or no possibility
nor likelihood in the world, that ever such or such a one should become a
catholic: for we have to the contrary innumerable examples in this age. Many
of our own knowledge having been noted and known to all the world for most
lewd, profane, and bad livers: yet have come afterward to give manifest
signs, tokens, and testimonies of their true repentance, rare graces, and
extraordinary amendment. Yea even Parsons (a lewder body then whom, was not I
verily think, of any that is now a Priest in England to be found: nor in whom
were less signs of true conversion when he first presumed to take that sacred
function upon him) yet if a man should go so straightly to work with him, as
he and his do with others: who that had seen and known him in Oxford and his
dealings there, how seditious, wanton, and factious this lewd bastards
conversation was: how for his libelling and other misdemeanour he was thrust
out of Balyoll College (and not for religion as he vainly vaunts, doctor
Bagshaw being then fellow of the same College, and his stiff adversary in
the matters objected against him, which I verily think is cause of a greater
hatred in all the Jesuits against the said doctor now, as an accident proper to
that society to be reuengefull to death: How he became so infamous there being
the^ master of Arts, that they hissed him out with whoubs and hoo-bubs, and
rung him thence with bells: how after his expulsio^ thence or relinquishing by
compulsion that place and College, he deeply protested upon occasion of
speech to one James Clark his old schoolfellow then abiding in the inner
Temple, that he neither then was, neither ever meant to be a papist (for so it
pleased that good fellow to call us catholics at that time) and offered for
his better satisfaction therein to take an oath before him for assurance of the
same: who I say that had and heard and seen the man at that time, yea and ever
since had conuersed with him, and noted well his whole life and conversation:
would ever have preferred him for any good part or act of piety, or sign of
grace, before any the seeming furthest of in all England, or else where? whom
in truth (if his own books and writings, and the rest of his fellows
speeches had not put me in mind of their impudency) I would never have
touched thus narowly (and yet sparingly as in an other place you shall hear)
nor brought him in for an example to prove that Finis coronat opus, and that
it is neither the good beginning, nor progress, nor regresse, nor any one
zealous act, nor long continuance, either in virtue or in vice: that notifieth
a man to be predestinate, or a reprobate: before the end of his life approve
it: and that the Parcae have cut the twist in two. For which intent and none
other but to pull down our peacocks plumy hearts, to keep our souls in awe,
and our consciences in fear, and neither the one nor the other to murmr or
make comparisons with Gods graces and our deserts: it was parabolizd of the
laborers, that had al a like pay at night, though some of them came not passing
three hours before supper: and others at noone tide: and yet were equald with
those that came in the morning, and had borne onus diei upon their shoulders.
And therefore a shame of the devil and all hypocrites and pharisees, that
having been (whatsoever they now are) the woorst men that live, and of as bad
a nature and base a moulde as ever water wette, or wind dried: must have
panegyries of their praises, and pieces shot of to make report of their
learning, their virtue, their prudence, their government, their piety, their
charity, their constancy, their perseverance, their assurance never to fail,
their predestinate state (phy, phy of the devil and puritanes, their
pharisaicall excellency, worth and rarenes in all things with the contraries
in all their opposites: yea so far contraries, as this base fellow Parsons
(whom some can ever hardly think to be a priest, but to live still irregular
upon a Luciferian pride) dare presume to call (in his impudently fathered
appendix upon Cardinal Allen) the king of Scots an obstinate heretic, in
effect: as no possibility of his conversion. And in an other book of his or
Father Creswels, they censure the king of France for a reprobate of God
forsaken; as impossible to be ever a sound catholic; though to the devil and
their shame and confusion, and I hope utter destruction, at least expulsion,
extrusion, exile out of these parts of Christendom, his majesty has given
better testimony already of his catholic faith, then that bastard Parsons ever
yet gave. And in this fellows letters you have heard before what his report
has bin of the students at Rome and other priests and lay persons else where:
and the like is now of their presumption to censure these reverend priests
actions above mentioned, for finding grace and favor at her majesty's hands:
as also their rash censure that such and such are obstinate heretics, and
impossible to be reclaimed, and by consequent not to be used in other matters.
Which great impudency in them, and manifest sign of an obstinate resolve, to
maintain ere long a most absurd and heretical opinion of impossibility, of
conversion of a sinner; both bewraies their archplot-caster, and others of
them, never to have been sound catholics to this hour; and therefore they
speak as in their own guilty conscience they find true: and also on the
other side it is flat repugnant to the general consent of the whole church,
yea, and to holy scripture it self, Misericordia eius super omnia opera eius,
God can forgive more then man can offend, and many comfortable examples to all
repentant sinners we have to confirm it: that Diligentibus deum omnia
cooperantur in bonum, yea even etiam ipsa peccata, said Saint Augustine, then
whom a greater sinner nor hotter heretic was not in his days.

And if here I might enlarge my self a little: who that had seen good king
David not content with all his wives and concubines, but first to have taken
his true and faithful servants wife: and then after she had conceived by him,
sent presently for her husband to have had him lien with her, and so to have
fathered the bastard spurius on him, and that not serving the turn to have
made the good knight Vry drunk of purpose to stir up lust in him, and thereby
to get him home to bed with his wife: and lastly when nothing would prevail to
hide his sin withal, rather then he would want his will, he would ieopard
the hazard of his whole life, to have this good and true knight cast away and
slain, and that done forth with to take her to his wife, Quam polluit per
adulterium. (Lo how many sins one upon another were committed in this one act)
who then to have seen this, and withal had remembered, how king Saul for a
far seeming less offense, was of God utterly rejected and forsaken, would
ever thought that it would have bin said by God of David, Inuem hominem
secundu^ cor meum? Who that had heard S. Peter curse, swear, forswear, and
deny his master thrice in two hours space and less, would ever have judged
him to have been the man of whom Christ our Savior said, Et tu aliquando
conuersus confirma fratres tuos? Who that had seen S. Paul (then Saul) so
busy to stone Saint Stephen, to keep their clokes that ran after him to beat
him down, to get letters with great eagernes and zeal in his kind, to take,
examine and bring all up to Jerusalem that should call upon the name of Jesus,
and to leave nothing undone pertaining to a Pursiuant a persecuter a cruel
tyrants part? Who that had heard and seen these things would ever have thought
to have heard it oracled from heaven of this same man: that vas electionis est
mihi, vt portet nomen meu^ coram gentibus etc? And finally, who that had seen
S. Marceline Pope, offering incense to idols: S. Boniface polluted in his lust
with Aglae a noble Roman matrone: The blessed Magdalene pointed at in the
streets as a common woman: would ever have looked for to have heard, that the
two first should have bin martyrs, or much less the last to have bin a woman
of rarest virtues (our blessed lady excepted) that ever either before or since
was borne? Sed non sicut homo iudicat Deus. Sixthly, I say last of al, that as
there is no assurance of any catholics perseverance, and not any
impossibility of any ones conversion that lives on earth: So be the profession
whatsoever it shall happen, yet may an affied trust be put for matters
pertaining to civil conversation and other affairs, in men of good moral
life and conversation, be they of what religion soever they be shall. And if
experience have tried it in Queen Mary's days, that a Throckmerton Sir
Nicholas by name (known to have been a hot protestant) was one and the first
(by Parsons own confession in Greenecoate) that informed the said Queen of
such attempts as then were to have prevented her reign over us: then should we
wrong our own hearts, cause, and actions; if any the least-scruple should be in
us not to reveal whatsoever treachery or treason were intended by any against
our now Sovereigns royal person, crown or state, and by consequent do both
our selves and those under her Majesty wrong, if we should be distrustful to
utter our minds freely, or to enter into familiarity with any for to do
either our afflicted friends as we are catholics, or our country as we are
English, any good that can be possible.

THE ARGUMENT OF THE EIGHT GENERAL QVODLIBET.
IN the argument of the seventh I told you of this eight Quodlibet, which by
many particular points there glanced at you may perceive, must directly tteate
of matters of state in the highest degree. And therefore is it of all other the
most dangerous point to deal in without offense of any: whom I would not
willingly offend for mine own part in any thing, by reason of special
occurrents, which being handled as some heretofore have handled them, might
breed great, apparent and manifest danger either to body or soul, or both
together. For here I am to entreat of excommunications and depositions of
princes, of pontifical power and regal majesty, and of other points of most
importance that in a world can be found. And because I am a catholic by
profession, and an Englishman by birth and education: in respect of the former
religion does inioyne me to acknowledge to death an humble obedience to the one
and only tressacred apostolical catholic Roman Church, the Sea Apostolic,
and our mother City. And hereupon I say with that reverend prelate the last
catholic Archbishop of York, that howsoever his holiness has been heretofore
or may be hereafter durus Pater unto us and our nation, by inflicting
excommunications or other ecclesiastical censures upon our prince, country or
our selves, and thereby occasionating our heavier persecutions: yet must we
always be dutiful children. And again in respect of the latter, natural
loyalty does bind me to wish no longer to live then until the swiftest
flight of a thought shall cross my dutiful obedience to my prince and
country. And upon this ground do I build firmly to death, never to attempt
by act, word or consent, any thing that may prejudice the one or the other: and
so keeping a golden mean betwixt the two extremes, yielding to Caesar that
which is Caesar's, and unto God that which is his own: I will now proceed to
the effectual points, whereupon all true catholics do and ought to stand.

THE EIGHT GENERAL QVODLIBET OF PLOTS by statizing.
THE I. ARTICLE.
Whether any ecclesiastical person may or ought to deal in matters of state.
And if they may: then whether any catholic priest may do so on the behalf of
the catholic Roman Church: or the English Bishops on the behalf of the Church
of England, or Scots ministry on the behalf of the Church of Scotland: or
how and in what sort these do differ from one another in freedom to deal in
state affairs.

THE ANSWER.
THat it is now, and ever has been lawful, for the clergy in general to
deal in state matters and affairs, practice, experience, and consent of all
persons, nations, times and ages do approve, ratify and confirm it: not a
legifer, not a law, not a parliament, not an act enacted, nor decree made
without the Lords spiritual: yea the word State it self, when we talk of
state affairs, has a relation to an ecclesiastical state, which being the
first and principal of the two members in a body political: once deprive the
clergy of all dealings or medlings any manner of way in state matters, and
then repeal, revoke, reuert all statute laws, and put out those words (Lords
spiritual) for ever after; the first most ancient and woorthily prime invested
Barons of this land (as all Bishops of England are) being these Lords
spiritual or ecclesiastical state. Therefore can I not but often smile in my
sleeue to hear and see the Jesuits coggery in every thing; and how that now of
late it is blown abroad amongst catholics, that the secular priests (forsooth)
are become profane lay persons in conversation, studying only state matters,
and practizing with the civil magistrate in state affairs. Upon occasion of
which speech, a gentlewoman in a passage of these matters at her table, said
to a secular priest (my self being there present unknown, and therefore freer
to laugh as I did heartily to hear her) nay my masters (quoth she) if you once
become statesmen, and have dealings with the Lords of the Counsel or other
civil magistrates, then I have done with you: For I never could hear of any
Jesuit, that did so. As though there could be no dealings in matters of state,
but that the party must be accessory to an act of treason, and be holden for a
statizer in a sense detestable. Well, let it pass for a Jesuitical iangling,
and leaving the etymology: we will come to the common phrase and acceptance of
this word State and Statiste as they are now taken, and thereby shall be
seen, ere this Quodlibet be ended, whether the seculars or Jesuits are greater
statists: that is, intermedlers in state affairs. And for the time present I
say as follows.

In answer to the Interrogatory (which is of many members) I say; First, that
it pertaines to all secular and ecclesiastical persons, equally and
indifferently be they catholics, protestants, or puritanes: to deal in state
affairs in two cases, the one is for the rectifying of men's and women's
consciences, and instructing all such as are of their flock and live under
their charges how they are to behave themselves to God, their prince, and their
country: when, and in what cases, bound to acknowledge obedience to the one or
the other, either coniunct or a part: and what is to be done in times of
persecution, civil wars, or foreign invasions, and the like: the other is
for making, giving, and promulgating of laws, publishing of books, and
prescribing or setting down of orders to be observed, and therewithal
delivering a genuine, true and literal exposition of the same. For although
all these things be absolutely in the prince, who only may make laws etc.
and is the direct legifer to all his subjects and others living within his
dominions, or under his allegiance any where, as appointed by God himself for
that purpose: when he said, Per me reges regnant, and legum conditores iusta
discernunt: yet forasmuch as there is a dependencie of laws and legifers, one
upon another (as I told you before) in the 7. Quodlibet, and for that it was
said in holy writ of old, that Labia sacerdotum custodient sapientiam, and
legem requires ex ore illius: quia angeli Domini exercituum sunt: which words
expressly appointing priests to be expositors of laws, are to be taken as
they may concern Gods honor: and what in conscience they do bind unto how
the so obliged subjects may be dispensed withal therein, and how not in any
wise. Therefore this being the office of the clergy, to explane to prince and
people, what the law of God and man is, and how far a temporal prince may
go in making of laws without repugnancie to the law divine: It follows,
that as their knowledge and experience must needs be greater then the Lords
temporal in all such cases, because it is their direct study: so also if any
book be to be written or law made, given etc. their interest under their
prince is the greatest and most of all other therein: and so by consequent in
these two cases the secular clergy or eccclesiasticall persons in this sense
for instruction of others, and by reason of their more learning and knowledge,
then more temporal persons orderly have or commonly can have: may be said to
deal in state matters of what profession soever they be.

Secondly, as for the secular priests here in England, in these heavy times
of their frownd on state, although they may lawfully deal in the premises:
yet must it be with a prouiso (which wanting) they endanger themselves and
those they live and converse withal. Yea and bring all other catholics to be
suspected and had in jealousy thereby. And that is, First, not to take upon
them by word or writing to impugn the parliamentall laws and statutes made.
Secondly, not to control either peremptorily or otherwise, the present
government of the state. Thirdly, not to impeach the dealings or proceedings of
any one of her Majesty's honorable Counsel or high commissioners in state
affairs. Fourthly, not to meddle directly or indirectly with disposing of the
crown this way, or that way, or appointing out of successors thereunto.
Fifthly, not and much less, to stir up further strife (as hereafter will be
proved) that the Jesuits have diued too deep over head and ears in all these
things. Sixthly, but a secular priests office (being neither of Court nor
Counsel) is in these cases only to admonish all good catholics to bear
Christ his cross with patience. Seventhly, not to meddle in writing, printing,
or procuring the publishing of any such book, libell, or pamphlet, as may
move, exasperate, or touch the present state in any of these points before
specified. Eighthly, and further, their office is by the way of mediatorship and
humble suit, to procure by all possible satisfaction (standing firm and
inuiolate their function and faith) to her Highness, and those in authority
under her: that those sharp penal laws made against innocent and harmeles
hearts, to the cause and shedding of much guiltless blood, that has been
spilt for the Jesuitical offenses: may either be abated and infringed by some
new prouiso made, or else all wholly repealed by parliamentall act or otherwise
dealt in, as in her Majesty's wisdom and high prudence of her honorable
Counsel shall be thought meetest for mitigation of our general afflictions.
Ninthly, and besides this the seculars office is to instruct every catholic
what they ought to think and what to do and say in these cases if they
should chance to come before the civil magistrate. Tenthly, and last of all,
if any book be set forth of state: (as those are which concern succession of
the crown, detraction of the present government, detection of any public
person in authority, defamation of the blood royal of the land, blasphemies
against regal majesty and the like, or any speech or practice for invasion of
the land, excommunication of our Sovereign: and getting consents for
advancement of an alien prince:) to write, act, speak, or otherwise to deal
against such persons and their treacherous designements to confute their false,
erroneous, and seditious books of those subjects, to confer or have
intercourse with the adversaries how to prevent those mischieues that hang
over the whole realm. In these and all such like cases may seculars statize,
that is, deal in state affairs how to prevent mischievous statizers, of their
purpose and practices: but no further, and so far only by conniuence for the
good of our common cause and safety of our country.

Thirdly, now for the Bishops and others of the clergy here in England, they
no question representing the ecclesiastical state, may deal in moving,
instructing, expounding, diuulging or doing any the like act perteining to
prime-membred, numbered, and accounted on state; as much, and so far as the
same state does authorize them under that title and name to deal in.

Fourthly, the like might be said in some sense for the Puritanean Consistory,
representing the ecclesiastical state in Scotland, were not that their
grounds, rules and principles of their government Oglogerchian (just like to
the Jesuitical platform) did utterly overthrow both states ecclesiastical
and temporal, and brought both head and members of the body political, to be
a plebeian hotch potch of popularitie: void of all name, nurture or nature of
any state. And by consequent the puritanes in England are in the same
predicament for state matters, that the Jesuits are in: both naught, unlawful,
detestable and directly to be called statists or rather statizers against the
present state. That this is so of the Jesuits shall be treated of in all the
ensuing articles; and for the present, that it is none otherwise to be
conceived of the Puritanean ministers: the Consistorian discourses, letters,
libels and practices of Knox, of Buchanan, of Beza, of Cartwright, of Barrow,
of Brown, of Field, of Gibson, of Dauison, and many others make it manifest:
nothing being more ordinary then to press England, and to inueigle her
Majesty's loyal subjects with the examples of Geneua and Scotland. Some few
of whose principles concerning state affairs I will here set down, as well
to give you to understand what state matters those are, which as unlawful,
treasonable, and pernicious, both to prince and state, are forbidden and do
endanger, entangle, and hazard their lives that deal in them: as also that
thereby you may judge how justly the Puritanes and Jesuits iumpe together in
statizing.

First, one and a chief principle of the Puritan ministers is, never to let
any form, face, show or name of an ecclesiastical state remain amongst them:
but to obliterate, eradicate, and utterly extinguish the name of Bishops, and
of all ancient ecclesiastical persons of, from the face of the earth. To
which effect a Scots minister in a letter to his friend says, that certain of
the chief noble men of England dealt with him (by instigation no doubt of some
English ministers in the year 1583.) to persuade the king of Scotland his
master to overthrow all the Bishoprics in his country, that his proceedings
therein might be an example for England adjoining. And so within two years
upon repair of 10000. men in arms to the king of Scots at Sterling, the
Bishoprics being wholly suppressed in deed one Knewstub a Consistorian
minister of Suffolk wrote thus to Field: I would be glad (quoth he) to hear
somewhat of the estate of Scotland: It does more trouble me then our own: For
I am conceiving some hope upon the change of their former proceedings. Which
hope no doubt was (as Cartwright said) that as those turbulent Consistorians
had been an example to the church of France and Scotland to follow them: so
the Lord (says he the said Cartwright) would have us also to profit and be
provoked by their example, what to do? mary to play the rebels as they had done.

Secondly, another principle (set down in Whittinghams preface to Goodmans
book) is taken out of Knox his doctrine, scil. that if kings and princes
refused to reform religion, the inferior magistrate or people, by direction
(forsooth) of the ministry might lawfully, and ought (if need required) even
by force and arms to reform it themselves. The first practice of which
principle was at Geneua, for abandoning of their lawful prince the Bishop of
that place. For when they perceived that the Bishop sought by force to
encounter their proceedings, and that as Sleidan notes) he had excited the Duke
of Sauoy to that end to assist him: they then joined themselves into a more
near amity with the Bernians, and other neighboring consistorian states: so
as the Duke and Bishop coming together to besiege the city were both repulsed
Bernatibus illis auxilium ferentibus.

Thirdly, another like principle to this is grounded upon an oath of
confederacy, taken first amongst the followers of Knox in Scotland upon a
letter of his written from Diepe in the year 1557. by the judgment (as he
says) of the most godly and learned that then lived in Europe (meaning John
Calvin and the rest of the Geneuians.) The effect of which oath, together with a
testification of their intents made by a kind of subscription was this: (sent
to the Queen Regent in time of parliament holden by her in Scotland:) that
unless they had their desires, they would proceed in their course for
suppressing of all religious houses in Scotland, agreeing to their order of
reformation prescribed to be observed through all that whole realm, ann. Dom.
1558. whereof a memorable letter was sent in the name of the people to all the
religious houses: that they should either remove thence by such a day, or else
they would then eiect them by force, and to make it sure on their part: these
new statists enacted before hand, there: that neither themselves nor any that
joined with them, should incur therefore any danger in life or lands, or
other political pains: and that if any violence happened in pursuit of these
matters, they meaning the Queen and her subjects) should thank themselves.
Whereupon shortly after being all put to the harm, and all men under pain of
rebellion inhibited to assist them for contemning the Queens summon for their
appearance at Striueling: they rose up presently in arms at Saint Iohns-towne
(excited by Knox his preachment, made for that purpose, for the overthrow of
religious houses) and within two days had quite destroyed and rased the houses
of Blackfriers, of the Grayfriers, and Charterhouse monks down to the ground;
and so proceeding in Fyfe, Angus, Mernis etc. breaking down all altars and
images: they wrote to the Queen (threatening to destroy Saint Iohns-towne for
that fact) that unless she staid from that cruelty, they should be compelled to
take the sword of just defense; protesting that without the reformation which
they desired, they would never be subject to any mortal man. Upon which
occasion taken, they writ to all their brethren to repair unto them: as also
to the nobles: upon pain of excommunication to join with them, as it being
their duty (said Knox) so to do, to bridle the fury and rage of wicked men,
were it of princes and emperors: Of like sort also they writ to the Bishops and
clergy (which then were in Scotland) that unless they desisted from dealing
against them, they would withal force, and power execute just vengeance and
punishment upon them: and that they would begin that same war which God
commanded Israel to execute against the Cananites. Which exorbitant letters of
theirs, took such effect with the temporaltie: that when Lion Herault in his
coat armor commanded all under pain of treason to repair to their houses by
public sound of trumpet in Glasco: never a man obeyed that charge, but went
forward to their associats at S. John Stow.

Fourthly, this principle and manner of statizing they termed by an other name
the resisting of the enemy: which to make strong they set down an other
principle, by entering into a league by solemn oath at their departure from S.
John's town, that if any one member of their congregation should be troubled,
they should all concur, assist and convent again together for defense of the
same. As presently after they did (upon a new quarrel picked against the Queen)
at S. Andrews, where by Knox his preachment, they made havoc, cast down,
spoiled and destroyed all the frieries and abbeys in the town. And so dealt
they shortly after with the abbie of Scone, the frieries of Striueling, of
Lithquo, and of Edenborough, whence the Queen being fled for fear, they kept
the field two months, took away the coining irons (being as the Queen
alleged a portion of the patrimony of the crown) and justified the same.

Fifthly, upon this principle followed another for contempt of all authority,
power and sovereignty in regal majesty. Whereupon entering into a new league
of confederacy, that from thencefoorth they would never come at the Queen
(though she sent for them) without consent of their company: they animated
their faction to be always ready, and to stand upon their guarde. They gave
their Queen the lie diverse times, and used her with most despitefull speeches.
They sawcily termed her part, a faction: (even just in all things like to the
Jesuitical proceeding) and renouncing their obedience unto her, protested that
whosoever should take her part, should be punished as a traitor, whenever God
should put the sword of justice into their hands. They consulted with Wilcocke,
Knox, and other ministers, for deposing of the Queen regent from her
government: who assuring the rest, that it was lawful for them so to do:
process was made, sentence was given, and her highness was deprived of all
regiment by a formal act set down in the same story penned by Knox, and
printed in part afterward here in England.

Sixthly, another most gross antistatisticall principle of theirs is: that they
of their exorbitant word and authority, might call a parliament, and enact
what they pleased without consent of king, Queen or other state. Whereupon
holding a mock parliament ann. Dom. 1560. by consent of the French king and
their Queen his wife, they (forsooth) therein reformed religion, and set out a
confession of the Christian faith: And upon intelligence given to the said king
and Queen, denied to confirm or ratify the acts thereof being moved
thereunto, the confederates answered: We little (said they) regard it, for all
that we did, was rather to show our dutiful obedience, then to beg of them any
strength to our religion. And when it was objected, that it could not be a
lawful parliament, where there was neither scepter, crown, nor sword borne:
They made light of it, saying, that these were rather pompous and glorious
vain ceremonies, then any substantial points of necessity required to a
lawful parliament.

Thus much for their principles of practice. Now for their doctrine of
statizing: the principles are also of like condition, whereof these are chief,
scil. First, that reformation of religion belongs to the commonaltie.
Secondly, that the commonaltie by their power may bridle the cruel beasts (to
use that beast Knox his words) the priests. Thirdly, that the commonaltie if
the king be negligent, may justly provide themselves of true preachers, and
maintain and defend them against all that do persecute them, and withal
deteine the profit of the Church livings from the other sort. Fourthly, the
commonaltie and nobility ought to reform religion, and in that case, may
remove from honor and punish such as God has condemned (he means idolaters
in the Deuteronomicall law) of what estate, condition or honor soever. Fifthly,
it is not birthright only nor propinquitie of blood, that makes a king
lawfully to reign above a people professing Christ Jesus. Sixthly, if princes
be tyrants against God and his truth, their subjects are freed from their oaths
of obedience. Seventhly, the people are better then their king and of greater
authority. Eighthly, the people have right to bestow the crown at their
pleasure. Ninthly, the making of laws belongs to the people, and kings are but
as Masters of the Roles Tabulariorum custodes. Tenthly, the people have the
same power over the king, that the king has over any one person. Eleuenthly,
it were good that rewards were appointed by the people for such as should kill
tyrants: as commonly there is for those qui lupos aut vrsos occiderunt, aut
catulos eorum deprehenderunt (says Buchan. de iure regni.) Twelftly, the
people may arraigne their princes. Thirteenthly, the ministers may
excommunicate the king. Fourteenthly, he that by excommunication is cast into
hell, is not worthy to enjoy any life upon earth etc. There are an hundred
twice told of the like statisticall principles and practices, to be collected
out of Calvin, of Beza, of Buchanan, of Hotaman, of Vrsin (as he comes out
from Newstad) vindici contra tyrannos, and of other puritan ministers of the
consistoriall tribe: fitly agreeing to the Iesuitical platform in their high
councels of reformation and other writings: All which are such matters of state
indeed, as no true subject can deal in, allowing of them: but is a rank
traitor for his pains.

THE II. ARTICLE.
Whether the seculars do or may prejudice the crown, commonwealth, or both,
or either state or government of England ecclesiastical or temporal, by
dealing in these affairs now in hand?

THE ANSWER.
NO way possible for them or any other loyal and natural English subject to
prejudice, hurt or offend any, either public or private person, or body
natural, civil or political: dealing as they do, in seeking only a
relaxation of persecution on their own and the catholics behalf, and a
security of state and quiet on the behalf of their prince and country, for
both which, nature, conscience, love, loyalty and duty do bind them all to
plead: as is evident by discourse upon all the particulars. As first for her
Majesty: it is a prevention of all dangers to her royal person, because
hereby a singular means may in her high wisdom be used, as well to find out
the puritan as the Jesuitical faction, as also to root both out of the land
by information given, and discovery of the one faction on the part of the
protestants: of the other on the part of the catholics. Secondly, for the
state present in general it gives an assurance: that by no word, writing or
other practice there can be any thing attempted without their priuitie, because
every one for their own indemnitie will be ready to reveal it, and thereby
stop the impotencie of traitors from so attempting, for fear of discovery ere
ever it come to acting. Thirdly, to the Lords temporal or civil state there
cannot come any thing for them to dislike of, as there being nothing desired at
their hands by the seculars and other catholics, but only a good word on
their poor distressed countrymens behalf, to her Majesty: that they may be
hereafter without fear of loss of life, lands or goods, or to be sacked,
ransackt, pild and polde as by inferior officers they have sometimes hitherto
been: And that the penal laws for payment of money for their recusancie may
so be tempered, as both her loyal catholic subjects may be able to live; her
Majesty's cofers more enriched; their service done with more alacrity to her
Highness in time of need, and all better appointed and able to perform what
they take in hand on her royal person and countries behalf, by this means.
Fourthly, to the Lords spiritual, there can in like sort no inconvenience grow
thereby: for that there is no suite either made or intended in prejudice of
their present incumbencie, or hinderance of one farthing they enjoy of the
ancient catholic church revenues, or abatement of one inch of their honor:
knowing that the gift of the Bishoprics in England as well by ancient
catholic, as also by recent laws, are in the prince to bestow where her
Majesty pleases: And therefore committing the controversy of religion,
succession and calling to silence in points of pacification and humble suite
for release of affliction, they yielding to them the honor of Earls or Barons,
as their place by gift of the prince does inuest them withal: there is no
cause moving them, to dissuade from toleration: but rather in truth, both
states and persons ecclesiastical and temporal in respect of the premises
for the safer continuance in their present interest, may conceive just cause
and many weighty reasons moving them on the seculars and other catholic
recusants behalf, against the Jesuitical and puritanian faction, to commence
their humble suite to her highness, for liberty of conscience: with a repeal,
or at least a gracious, mild and comfortable mitigation of former sharp
penal laws, made as well against the seminary priests themselves, as also
against all those that receive or relieve them any manner of way. Fifthly, to
the catholic recusants themselves there is none sanae mentis (unless bewitched
with the Jesuitical vain hope of future aduancements) but may and no doubt
but do and will daily more and more easily perceive it, that this, betwixt the
seculars and Jesuits was the happiest contention that ever rose: and that all
discreet, virtuous and sound catholics in deed, have just cause (especially
if of a natural, humane breed, and not mungrels, nor bastards) to give God
thanks every day upon their knees, for this so sweet, unexpected,
extraordinary, comfortable, and to be admired at, means to all posterity.
scil. how ever such hart-breaking broiles should have turned to so great a good
on all sides, as doubtless if the devil play not the knave too too
egregiously, and prevail more then ordinary, these cannot choose but turn
unto: First, in receiving hereby a wholesome mithridate or antidotum to the
spiritual health and recovery of many a devout soul, against the most
dangerous infections, and by all other means irremedilesse poison of the
Jesuitical doctrine, then by banishing out of their minds this unsavory
comparison and distinction of persons in bestowing of spiritual graces, with
ego sum Pauli, ego Apollo etc. after that by breeding in every virtuous,
sincere, religious catholic heart a more reverend regard to priesthood in
general, and to their ghostly fathers in special, then now they have by the
Jesuitical policies and most Machiuillian persuasions. And last of all there
would be then, the woonted joy at meeting of priests and catholics together:
whereas now, and so long as the Jesuits remain in this land, there is none
other, to be expected, but mutinies, brabbles, detractions, defamations,
watchings, intrappings, betrayings of one another, and nothing but a mournful
black sanctus in steed of a joyful Alleluia at the conversion of any soul,
or furtherance of any good, catholic, and charitable action.

THE III. ARTICLE.
Whether any religious person may, or ought to meddle or have any dealings in
state matters or secular affairs as other ecclesiacticall persons, or as now
the secular priests do deal, or not, and if any other may, then why not the
Jesuits.

THE ANSWER.
TO this interrogatory I answer: First, that Ex officio and de iure, no
religious person one or other ought or may lawfully deal either in state or
any other secular affairs: because the word secular and a fortiori stat, are
words resumed into wordly actions in their practice: and therefore as far
from a religious profession to meddle withal, in regard of their vow of
poverty (whose essentials are humility, silence, solitary life, renuntiation
of the world and a civil voluntary monastical death) as for them to break
out of their cloisters, and take a benefice without leave in regard of their
vow of obedience: or to take a wife in regard of their vow of chastity, etc.
Secondly, as notwithstanding their vow of voluntary poverty they may have and
possess lands and all other things in common: so may they also carry a kind of
state amongst themselves: and thereupon being subjects also to their prince,
and members incorporate to the common wealth wherein they live; their Abbots,
Priors, Guardians, and other superiors chosen amongst them to rule over them,
may be admitted by the two states ecclesiastical and temporal to deal in
secular affairs and matters of state: as other Bishops and Parsons
ecclesiastical may, and so was the custom of old in this land, that commonly
the Abbot of Westminster was Lord Treasurer of England: the Archbishop of York
Lord president of the North, and sometimes one Bishop and other while an other
was Lord Chancellor of the realm. Thirdly, yet was neither this a freedom
to the monks of their cloister to live secularly, neither was it allowed of,
as general to all religious orders, to be advanced so: because some are bound
by vow to the contrary: and as repugnant to their profession they bear no
state amongst themselves but live all in humiliation without possessions,
lands, or any thing that smells of the world save only a house to shrowde them
from cold: a church to serve God in, and meat and drink to keep life and
soul together: as of alms shall be given them, etc. Fourthly of all other
religious orders the Jesuits by profession should be furthest of from all
secularity statising, or other worldly dealings: and yet on the contrary, they
of all the rest are become not only most secular and ecclesiastical but also
most laicall temporal and profane, yea most treacherous, ambitious, seditious
and dangerous, both to themselves and all others where they live: as these
articles here shall discover of our own country Jesuits more at large.

THE IIII. ARTICLE.
Whether any clergy person of what religion profession or sect soever he be
(for I take it to be all one when we talk of state affairs whether the
statist be catholic protestant or puritan every one thinking his own course
to be best) may or ought to labor for planting of his own religion; or only
ought he to seek the temporal good of his country, letting religion go where
and how it pleases God it shall.

THE ANSWER.
THere is no question in it: but abstracting in this point of statizing from a
matter of faith, to a matter of policy: all men of what religion soever
(supposing they have and think in conscience that they have the truth on their
side) are bound to propagate, plant, and establish the religion they are of to
the uttermost of their power: yet so as all may be ad aedificationem, non ad
destructionem. And whosoever thinks his religion best must think this
withal, that the means of restoring it (be it the puritanes amongst
protestants or protestants amongst catholics or catholics amongst either of
these, or any other) must not be by treasons, conspiracies, and invasions. The
conversion of any country by such attempts did never come to good effect. The
old beaten paths have ever proved to be the best, readiest and surest ways to
walk in: for the due performance of those designements. And the ancient manner
of planting the catholic faith has been by preaching, prayer and sacrifice,
private instructions, hearing confessions, giving absolutions and exercising of
other priestly functions; and that done, then to commit the rest to God. To
yield all temporal duties and services to the Prince under whom they live:
yea though aliens by birth and strangers to his Nation, people, and natural
subjects much more then if borne under his native allegiance. And so shall he
neither cast of the care and dutiful service to his prince and country:
neither shall nor ought the care, fear or respect had thereof, discharge him
of his duty to God and our holy mother the catholic church: and to wish to his
neighbor as to himself therein: Always observing the Apostolical course in
converting of others to the catholic faith: Such a course as Saint Peter took
first in Jerusalem, then at Antioch, then at Rome etc. As Saint Paul took at
Damasco, at Corinth, at Crete, at Athens, and at and in all countries,
provinces and places where he came: As Saint James the just called our Lords
brother, took in the kingdom Judah and Jerusalem, and throughout the
provinces of Israel: As Saint John took at Ephesus, and throughout all the
churches of Asia under him: As Saint Philip took at Hierapolis in Phrygia, and
throughout all Scythia: As Saint James the son of Zebedee and brother to
Saint John, took in Spain: As Saint Bartbolomew took in India, and the great
Armenia: As Saint Matthew took in Aethiope: As Saint Simon Zelotes took in
Mesopotamia: As Saint Jude or Thaddaeus took in Egypt: As Saint Andrew elder
brother to Saint Peter took in Scythia of Europe: and as Saint Thomas took
amongst the Parthes, Medes, Persians, Brachmans, Hyrcans and Bactrians: And in
few, as Saint Denis took among the French: Fugatius and Damianus among the old
Albion Britains: and Saint Augustine amongst the English Saxons, of whom we
all came. These courses then that these glorious martyrs and blessed Saints
took for conversion of countries, are for all catholic priests to imitate:
and to leave these Jesuitical, seditious, rebellious, barbarous and
preposterous courses to satan and those infernal spirits from whence they
came, ever confessing as true, sincere, and religious catholics should, that
innouations are ever dangerous, that new fanglenesse in the least point of
faith and religion is most pernicious: and that novelties and fine devises of
busy and unquiet heads, are but as May flowers that are gone in June: carrying
a fair show but never continue long. Therefore let every catholic priest
seek (in the name of Jesus) the conversion of our country: but not as the
Jesuitical faction has sought. Let them seek it by priestly conversation not
by popular deuastation. Let them study to teach obedience not rebellion: to
fill men's hearts with inward joy and peace: not feed their ears with outward
hopes of invasions and treacheries: to possess their souls with laments in
Apostrophees of compassion: with good Saint Gregory who sighed sore for our
forefathers being strangers unto him, to see so many souls perish in our
Nation every hour, and not puff up their hearts with preposterous cogitations
of moon shine of the water.

THE V. ARTICLE.
Whether do the Jesuits in this point of Statizacion agree either amongst
themselves or with any other priests or lay persons?

THE ANSWER.
TTo this I answer. First, that it is manifest by the matter it self now in
question: that the secular priests and they, do quite disagree herein.
Secondly it is to be noted, that their agreement amongst themselves, concerning
state meddles may be taken three manner of ways: one way as it concerns our
country in particular, and therein questionless there is no Jesuit in
Christendom but he is of one and the self same mind, that his fellows are of
scil. that they all could wish to have England Scotland and Ireland under them,
Note by this discourse here following, that if the Jesuits had got England, we
should have had a government deposition, and a Presbyter John penes quem
imperium.
to make these Northern Isles all one Jesuitical Monarchy: to infeoffe
themselves by hook or by crook in the whole imperial, dominions of great
Britania: with the remainder over, to their corporation or puny fathers,
succeeding them, as heirs special in their society, by a state of perpetuity:
putting all the whole blood royal of England to the formedowne, as but heirs
general in one predicament together. That this is so, and that their wish,
their hope, their intents in proceeding, their labor in performing, their
endeavor in perfecting this plot and platform are equally agreeing, to all of
them a like (though the means and manner how to effect be different agreeing
to their different natures, dispositions, qualities, and abilities; as some to
be aulicall, others martial, others rural: and again of those some to be
actors others prompters, others inuentors, or plotcasters, etc.) It is clear
by many general circumstances. As that for one, of maintaining the Archpriests
authority (as all the English Jesuits do most eagerly): whose institutiue
jurisdiction is directly proved to extend to this point and practice for their
advancement to the monarchy. Then for the Scots Jesuits a man would think
that if any of that society were against Parsons proceedings they should be the
most resolute. But notwithstanding this (omitting all the rest) co^niuing and
some most earnestly pursuing, auerring, embracing the said Parsons opinion as
their speeches to my self declared when they were afraid I should have
published my book in answer to his Doleman for the succession, etc. Yet even
father Cryton who only the Scots king did hope well of, is proved by Master
Cicills book against him to be as forward as the other on the Spaniards
behalf; and most egregiously to mock, flatter, dissemble and collogue with
his native Sovereign. And as for the Jesuits of other Nations: it may appear
by the state book of reformation for England drawn out by Parsons and the
general of the Jesuits, in cuius virtute caeteri operantur, that they all
aim at one mark, and one course, and conceive one and the same general hope
to have England a Iapponian Monarchy (as once one termed it) or an apish
Island of Jesuits. An other way, their statizing may be taken for their private
opinions concerning the next successor viz. whom this and that Jesuit would
gladliest have their vmpier, patron, and champion, to fight the field on their
behalf, in bringing the whole realm under their subjection. And herein
because arrogancy, pride, and ambition, has set them all so high on
horseback, as look what Prince or Noble can go away with the English crown:
that same, they hope to be the aduancer of him most, who most did further their
pretense, and was the greatest means to work on their behalf, to have them
accepted of as General of the army, in that exploit expeditionall against
England intended. Therefore in regard hereof, they are questionles often at
daggers drawing amongst themselves, whether some English, or Scots, or Spanish,
or German General should have the name of Emperor or Dictator for the time of
the conquest. The Scots men knowing that if any of their nation should have the
pre-eminence, then should their Critons, their Gordans and other Jesuits of
their nation be highest promoted: the English not doubting but that if any of
our own nation should sway the scepter royal by their means, that then their
Parsons, their Creswels, their Garnets, and others should have the pre-eminence
over the rest of the Jesuits: and so if a Spaniard had the honor point, then
the Jesuits of Spain: if the Archduke, then those of Germany should be most
advanced. And thus ambition and affecting of sovereignty does so tickle them
all with vain and fantastical hopes of England, as quot homines tot
sententiae amongst them: for the particular action, by whom it should be
chiefly acted. And I verily think, the first manner of proceeding, as Doctor
Cicill insinuates, makes it apparent, that the hot contentions, wranglings,
brabbles, and brawlings betwixt father Parsons and father Criton about the next
successor, was not absolutely for defeating the Scots title, and advancing of
the Spanish: which both (as it seems by Critons speech in Master Cicils
apology) did seek for. But the question in secret betwixt them was; whether
it were fitter, to have the Scots king, or some other noble of Scotland preferred
as viceroy under the Spaniard, or else the Earl of Arundell, or Darby, or
Essex, or some other of the English nobles (had they title, or had they none)
to the English crown. And so both like traitors against their sovereigns and
country, cogd the one with the other in their ambitious aspires, pretending a
bears love each one to his country, for his own paunch.

A third way of the Jesuits agreement in statizing may be taken, as it is an
humor in these kind of men that are ambitious: to be always loath to live in
subjection under any, or to acknowledge any superior above themselves (though
of their own order, society or company) where they live. And this as well in
regard, that they would not be crossed in their designments (for any the least
touch of contradiction strikes a proud self conceited body dead at heart) as
also for the humorous delight they take in commanding in chief, where they
live; though but over three or four persons at the uttermost: for a king of
crickets, a bedle of beggars, and a Pigmay captain in a conquest of cranes,
will straight drive pride into a conceit of a supremacy to be in himself
sance pere. And by reason of this natural inclination in most of those that
are Jesuits (for amongst these three sorts of men whereof I told you before, to
wit, wise, wealthy or worshipful only admitted to be of their society)
there is a great question, which should go away with the sovereignty, wit,
wealth and worship being al three incentiues of aspiring. And you shall not
find any that has spirit in him, but howsoever he vaunt of obedience (as the
only way to win others to be obedient unto him) and does indeed actually
submit himself in all things to his superior Jesuit appointed over him: yet
will he seek so much as is possible to get his neck out of the collar, his
head out of the halter, and his vowed obeisance from under the yoke of
commandants over him, by setting forth himself so, as he may seem to be fit
either to be a state Counselor for his gravity: a provincial for his
policy: a rector for his government: a courtier for his complements, or an
intelligent for his impudency. And in all these he must show himself to have
a busy stirring head full of inventions, innouations, and novelties; and so
coming to advancement, he is freed in a sort from ordinary controlment. That
this is a third cause or kind of statizing, wherein the Jesuits do mightily
disagree, and are often at open wars by brawlings, wranglings, contentions
and chidings amongst themselves, defaming, backbiting, slaundering and
supplanting one an other (to omit what I have heard of their civil broiles,
hatred and emulations in other countries: as also what has been already said
out of Parsons own writings, and other things handled obiter in this treatise:
especially whiles Doctor Lewis Bishop of Cassana was visitor general to whom I
told you before how they put up complaints against one an other) I refer you
for this time to one or two treatises penned and published by some very learned
and grave catholic priests: wherein you shall find a large discovery of one
of these Rabbis, ruffling, shuffling, flourishing iars and iumblings to exempt
himself from controlment of any superior: and to be an absolute statesman
paramount, peregall, peremptory to command all others as actor independent of
any, to act all his actions, I mean the great emperor illegitimate, irregular,
abstract quintessence of all coins, coggeries and forgeries, Parsons the
bastard of Stockersey beyond Cosmage in Sommersetshire. How cruelly and
Machiuillianlike he ouerthrewe the credit of father Heiwood, for presuming
forsooth to equal himself with him, at their being together in England: and
how flying hence, being laden with the spoil of many poor catholics, he
practiced to be exempted from the check of the Parisian provincial, under
pretense forsooth, that the Queen of England had hired certain persons to
murder him there: and since that time has ever given himself to the study
of state matters.

This is that famous conqueror, who has bathed all England by his seditious
libels in priests blood. This is that worthy excellent, that lies, dissembles,
and equiuocates at every word. This is that learned counseler, that must rule,
ruff and range through every state. This is that same Parsons, whom pope,
prince and peer with all true English hearts have cause to hate. This is he of
whom his own general reported, that he was more troubled with one English
man, then with all the rest of his society. This is he of whom Cardinal Alan
held this opinion, that he was a man very violent, and of an unquiet spirit:
and of whom M. Blackwell (now his darling) said, that his turbulent head and
lewd life would be a discredit to the catholic cause. And in few: the general
conceit of all that ever have thoroughly conuersed with him, is this, that he is
of a furious, passionate, hot, chollerike, exorbitant working humor, busy
headed, and full of ambition, envy, pride, rancour, malice, and revenge:
whereunto through his latter Machiuillian practices may be added, that he is a
most diabolical, unnatural, and barbarous butcherly fellow unworthy the
name, nay cursed be the hour wherein he had the name of a priest, nay of an
irreligious parson, nay of a temporal, lay man Jesuit, nay of a catholic,
nay of a Christian, nay of a humane creature: but of a beast or a devil: a
violater of all laws: a contemner of all authority, a stain of humanity, an
impostume of all corruption, a corrupter of all honesty, and a Monopole of all
mischief. From whom as from the source of all our sorrows do daily ebb,
flow and rise up to full floods in bubbles of blood and tears, new spring
tides of our English calamities: keeping us all continually tossed to and fro
upon the Ocean maine of incessant sadness: All eyes of enemies casting a greedy
look after the long expected pray, he has put them in hope of: all our
friends bewailing our heady downfall in his plotted intendments: all English
hearts irritated by him: our sovereigns life often sought for, our country
standing betrayed into the enemies hands: our selves poor innocent men and
women (that be catholics and ignorant of his bloody practices and unnatural
designements) have already felt the smart of his wickedness: whilst he like a
faint soldier, nay a dastardly coward (for never expect manhood in Machiauel,
high prowes in politikes nor valor in vices) and a false deceitful shepherd
did wind himself out of the briars and left both us and Christ his flock to
the spoil. And would God he had but only left: for then should we have found
no want of far his betters, there having ever been better then he, for
learning, wisdom, government and all true tokens of virtue, piety, and
religion even when he was at the best: which was at the time of his writing the
Resolution; a very commendable and worthy work in deed, though neither of any
so high points above ordinary capacity, as to merit him the name of a
schooleman or yet of any great or profound divine, being but a plain positive
discourse, and that not of his own absolute invention but taken out of other
authors, only the praise being his for well translating of it, close couching
and packing it up together in a very smooth style and singular good method:
wherein truly he was to be commended. But was all this comparable to Solomon,
to Origin, to Appollinaris, and many more who lost their good spirits by their
self conceits, and he his by his proud ambitious hearts aspires, so unable now
to speak or write of any spiritual, priestly or religious matter, as a very
reverend priest coming over of late told me, that he never heard a meaner
sermon made beyond the seas, then he had heard of father Parsons, and that his
words and writings for edifying or giving any good instruction and ghostly
counsel, were as barren, bare and far from his former abilities on that
behalf, as if he had been before father Robert Parsons the Jesuit, and now
poor George Parsons the waiward fool his brother. Thus it is when proud
Nimrods will presume to build Babel above the welkin: take upon them to be
strong hunters coram Domino: and think to face it out, that the outward
appearance and habit only may forestall, carry away and preiudicate men's
conceits: where the effects disclaim to the contrary, crying out against him:
that he has lost the spirit he had through his arrogancy and abuses of Gods
graces. If he be a religious man he is in the number of monasticks: what has
he then to do with the world, to coosen the innocent and heap together this
mucke of the molde? If he be a Jesuit, he has by profession sequestrated
himself from all meddling in secular affairs: what has he then to do with
common wealths titles, successions and princes proceedings? If he have abiured
all pomp, majesty and glory here on earth: he is for a church and a
cloister, not for courts and palaces: what has he then to do in determining
of state matters, to court to monarchs, to cap to crowns, to canton
kingdoms, and to crown kings and Queens, with pamphlets as he pleases. If
he be a priest, his office is to pray and offer sacrifice for the living and
the dead (pie and religiose de resurrectione mortuorum cogitans:) for the popes
holiness, and all cardinals, bishops and clergy, and the whole church of God
here militant on earth: for the unity, league, peace and concord amongst all
Christian princes: for the conversion of all nations to the catholic Roman
Church: for the extirpation of all Paganism, Iudaisme, Turcisme, infidelity,
schism, and heresy: for the preservation of his prince and country from all
inuading foes, civil wars, and other enemies both bodily and ghostly: for
all the nobles and peers of his sovereigns realm: for his own flesh and
blood, friends and kindred, if he have any (as being filius terrae: he is of a
great Clan base though it be.) In few, if a vestall virgin in time of
gentilisme could not be brought to utter any curse, execration, or imprecation
against an enemy of Rome: because as she said (in pagan rite) her office was
to pacify not to punish, to preserve not to put down, and to pray for all,
not to persecute any: then much more ought this to be a christian catholic
religious priests office and charge: then what has he to do in Campo Martio,
with Bellonaes banner, to balance his pen with gastfull gores of English
blood, or to imbrew a priestly hand in princes bowels? O monster of mankind
fitter for hell, then middle earth. If thy profession will not draw thee to
consideration of the premises: yet show some signs of charity in sparks of
grace, if it were but only in policy, to move thee to forbear thy barbarous
cruelty: because thereby thou give occasion for diverse, to think thou art
not a mere man, but some Fairies brat, or begotten by an Incubus or aerish
spirit, upon the body of a base woman. And there fore imitating thy vile
progenitors, thou daily do minister new matter to increase our home
persecutions, by thy spritish cruelty. Princes are always jealous, and many
times have just cause, and ever more then any other private person to be so:
for the greater honors the greater, mo, and grieuouser osors. Why do thou
then not now surcease from provoking our prince to be suspicious of us by thy
trecheries, after the blood of an hundred martyrs all innocent men and reverend
priests shed by thy means? Lo, wretch, is not this enough to give thee a
gorge: to glut a cormorants mew never satiated with our blood? Leave of, leave
of, leave of: it is not possible for all you Jesuits in the world, with all the
help of hell and puritanes to band it out. Your plants are blasted in the bud:
your corn shaken before the reap: and your whole society become infamous, by
your prouincials most hateful platforms. And howsoever these Quodlibets or
other discoueries of your hypocrisy be hardly taken of some for a time, and
holden of many for odious libels: yet in tract of time, when passions are
alaid, and blind affections have referred the matter to reason to consider of:
then questionles both men and women will give us thanks, for that we have done,
in seeking your amendment, and riddance of you out from amongst them.

THE VI. ARTICLE.
Whether (seeing that all the Jesuits seem to be of one mind for the
conquest of England in general: and that they differ only in the particulars
upon their own private ambitious respects had for every man's particular
advancement (wherein father Parsons bears down the rest) did then the
foresaid Parsons meddle directly at any time in state matters in a case
detestable, I mean whether did he and his accomplices ever solicit any
foreign invasion of Spaniard or others to take arms against her Majesty
their natural sovereign, especially in the year 1588. And not only excited
the said king to depose her highness: but also to bring this realm into
subjection of the Spaniards, under pretense of restoring the catholic faith.
And if so, then whether did they well or not?

THE ANSWER.
Would God the wretch had not been borne that has forced us for our free
discharge before God and man, to enter into these five bloody articles here
ensuing: to expostulate with one another, what has been the cause of our daily
increased persecutions and heavy calamities at home and abroad. Well,
howsoever it fall out, iacta est alea. Poor catholics both clergy and
laity, hurried, hailed, and tossed from post to pillar, from wigge to wall,
by a restles course of miseries, fears and dangers, running per circulum, nunc
cui neque apud Danaos locus est atque insuper ipsi Dardanidae infensi, poenam
cum sanguine poscunt. We come to encounter this Hispanized Camelion Parsons,
with all his Africanian phalanges and Jesuitical forces. Against whom maugre
all their sophistry, aequiuocating and clenchiall doublings to the comfort of
all true catholic hearts for their better instruction in time to come: and to
make known to all the world how that the seculars were ever free of themselves
from these state practices, and that only the Jesuits are the men, who with
their followers, fautors and seditious faction, have been the instigators,
suggesters, prompters, actors and vrgers of these unnatural, wicked and
traitorous courses. I say then (and I am bound in conscience to speak it) that
though it grieve and gall their guts out, that are of the Jesuitical humor (as
those who can endure nothing worse then to hear of their own lewdnes:
especially when they are prevented of their purpose, which will force them in
that case to deny any thing be it never so true:) yet it cannot be denied, but
that in the year 1588. There was never honest man (as I think) that pend such
a treatise as this book here mentioned, to have gone under the good Cardinals
name, who sure would never have lent his name to it (as he did not) but for the
vehement urging of this Machiau^llian Jesuits persuasion, which full sore
repented him afterward, in so much that when he hear^e and well perceived what
they went about, for destroying and ruinating of his native country, he wept
tenderly not knowing how to remedy it, nor much less how to bridle the
Jesuitical insolency.
Cardinal Allan compiled a book, at the importunate suite of father Parsons
impudently urging his Grace thereto, to have been published when the Spaniards
should have arrived for the same intent premised in the article. The first part
of which book was entitled A declaration of the sentence etc. the second, An
admonition to the Nobility and people of England etc. Of these books a great
number were printed, but presently upon the overthrow of the great invincible
Armado under their heroical Adlantado, father Parsons for shame of the world,
and to the end that it should not be known how the expectation of the false
prophet was frustrate, procured the whole impression to be burnt, saving some
few that had been sent abroad before hand to his friends, and such as had
otherwise been conveyed away by the Printer, and others in secret wise. Some
whereof ferrying over the maine, were wafted into the south Ocean shores: and
cast on land, came to diverse their hands that durst not avouch their harbor.
One father Currey a Jesuit, speaking in a faint brauado of that book to a
secret friend of mine (who durst not be known to favor me) said, that it was a
work of that worth, as it would yet bite in time to come: and that if by
coniuration or otherwise, the Queen or the Council (especially the Lord
Treasurer whom he named in chief) could have any inkling where it were: they
would not leave one stone standing upon another in the house where it should
happen to be heard of, but blow it up, or burn and consume it all to ashes
before they would miss of it. Well, as for that I understand the Counsel has
got a sight of it without any such extraordinary search made for it. And like
enough by some Jesuits means: now that the matter fadges not as they would,
to have the fault laid wholly upon the Cardinals neck, if possibly they could.
But howsoever, yet great pity it was that the books and the burner, the
woorthles work and the wretched father were not both made a burnt sacrifice or
offering combust together.

Amongst other seditious, pestilent, and craftily inueigling propositions set
down in that book, one was this, (in the second part thereof) scil. That the
king of Spain at length as well by his holiness authority and exhortation, as
by his own unspeakable zeal and piety, moved also not a little by my
(says he) humble and continual suit, together with the afflicted and banished
catholics of our nation, of all and every degree: Who have been by his
special compassion and regal munificency, principally supported in this our
long exile, has condescended at last to take upon him this so holy and
glorious an act, etc. Hitherto the Cardinal by father Parsons suggestion and
prompting him, what he should write for to allure the Spaniard as master
Charles Paget has been informed. Out of which words I gather these Corolaries
following. First, that they are of the same tenure, and carry the self same
sense with them that the like speech does in a passage of father Parsons
Appendix to the succession, fathered also upon the said Cardinal after his
death, notwithstanding that Doctor Gifford (one of whose books no English
Jesuit of them all is worthy to carry after him) has a letter to show that
the same discourse was wholly of this Polypragmons own doing, very unhonestly
put upon the dead. But bastards have ever one dog trick or other of the
corruption they come of, and so has he for forgerie, cogging, and lying as a
notorious a sign of a graceless wretch as any in this age. His words in the
Appendix are these, scil. After a long circumquaquam locutionem, of the
impediments infringing all and every pretenders title borne within this famous
isle, and as long a peroration on the Lady Infantaes behalf: who though all
England were Catholics, and those of the blood royal, so in esse with all,
yet were her title as good as the best (says he:) and by consequent concludes
with this bobbe given to all our nation: that the gift of the crown of England
was in the oldking Catholics hands, who perhaps (quoth this patch Parsons) may
be persuaded, as also his son the now king may be to the like, set to give
over his claim, and surrender up his whole interest and right thereunto to his
daughter Clara Eugenia Isabella, yielding her aid for atchieuing of the same
to her, and some such chatholicks Noble as his Majesty shall think fit for a
husband to a Lady of so high parentage. Who being now the Archduke Albert, late
Cardinal etc. if follows that he is the Peer must be our Prince by
Coruester Parsons designements. And seeing he there insinuates as much, and
that the foresaid Cardinal Allan had dealt with the king of Spain as he would
make the world believe to that intent and purpose: the case then and therein is
clear, that this same book here mentioned, and that Appendix were both of
Parsons own doing; as birds of one nest, feather and wing, hatched by the
unnatural heat of his ambitious heart. Secondly, I observe both here and
there: that there was great difficulty and doubts put, in persuading the king
of Spain to this exploit for the conquest of England, and that there was much
adoo to draw him unto it, had not the parties mentioned importuned him to our
countries overthrow. Thirdly, they account the intended massacre of her
Majesty, and of so many thousands of her good subjects as must have died if
the Spaniard had prevailed (as before I proved it unto you by the words of the
Duke of Medina, and other testimonies to that purpose) a holy and glorious
act, and to have been undertaken of an unspeakable zeal and piety, etc.
Lo Nobles and Gentiles you dear catholics of both sexes and all degrees:
Medina vows he will spare none, be he or she Catholic, Protestant, or
whosoever: this book affirms the massacre intended is an act of zeal: what
case are you now in: if your Sovereign forsake you also? and who shall, can, or
will defend you? if she give you over to the persecutor? what have you to say
in your own defense to save your lives? if her highness draw the sword of
justice and lay it upon you? Truly nothing at all: but so many of you as are
loyal subjects (your religious catholic consciences reserved, being as
innocent, as ignorant of those practices: whereof I dare boldly speak it in
the word of a priest, many thousands in England never heard of before the
publishing of these Quodlibets) might justly have fed your dying souls with
hope of Beati qui persecutionem patiuntur propter iustitiam, quoniam ipsorum
est regnum caelorum. But for other hopes you could have none. Fourthly, the
false hearted Cateline inuolueth all the catholics that were then beyond the
seas, in that his most Turkish, Iesuitish, Puritanian, and barbarous
designements. Fifthly, he intangleth such as received so great favors at her
Majesty's hands and the state here: as that where by the laws they might all
have been put to death, they were only banished. Yet notwithstanding he
forces them to become intercessors both for the destruction of her Highness,
and of her kingdom. Sixthly, what just cause is here given to her Majesty and
the state, of severe proceeding against all such catholics as were then beyond
the seas; when they should come home: in that they all sought and thirsted
after the blood of their country, vos iudicate. But I hope (and in part I know
it) that the false bastard Jesuits pen when he writ those words, did but
express the traitorous hearts of himself and some few of his consorts: and
that he has most egregiously belied many. For of the Lord Dacres and sundry
others as well of the clergy as laity, it is well known they were ever most
opposite to those traitorous practices: and therefore most mightily persecuted
by Parsons and his confederates: notwithstanding they still held and do hold
out, as loyal English subjects vsque ad sanguinem, as obedient catholic
children, vsque ad aras, and as serviceable in heart to both, God, and man Pope,
Prince, and to the catholic Romish church, and the English common wealth, as
soul and body in one person can afford, or faith and fealty: religion and
loyalty: divine love, and natural affection can expect, or demand at their
hands. And for the rest, if any were so sotted and bewitched with Iesuitisme;
or infected with the Spaniards as I doubt too many were: I wish for my own
part, even from the bottom of my poor but resolved catholic loyal heart, so
many of them as remain obstinate with Parsons in that unnatural combination,
fair and well buried in their graves.

Thus having made the first part of the Interrogatory most apparent and
manifest, I will now prosecute the answer to the second, in as brief and
plain a method as I may. Say then for the present (which yet is more then I
would willingly put to maintain the time and our afflicted state considered)
that his Holiness and the king of Spain might lawfully have taken arms
against her Majesty and this her kingdom our native land: yet it was
shameful part of father Parsons and his companions to be the contriuers or
instigators of it: as it is to be proved by many memorable examples agreeing
to this purpose, scil. First, out of holy writ it is manifest and apparent that
the Iebusites and other inhabitants of the land of behest, were permitted there
to live even after the Israelites had obtained the land as their own ancient
inheritance: ergo a foreign people of a native brood are not to be by Gods
laws subjected in their native soil by strangers of an alien land. Secondly,
Gregorius magnus when he might have rid the parts and coasts of Italy, from
the tyranny of the Goths and other savage peo-people, if he would have
intermedled in matters of blood: refused so to do, accounting it to be a course
not fit for a man of his calling to deal in. Thirdly by the laws, customs,
and practice of all kingdoms, such persons as shall machinate and devise to
execute such outrageous designements against their prince and country: have
ever been justly condemned and detested of all honest men and good subjects:
yea, and even of those same princes inuadors or usurpers, that coming to sway
the scepter royal of a kingdom by such means: never suffered such traitors to
pass unpunished, nor without the just guerdon of treason, deducere canes ad
inferos, as by sundry examples in the Antiperistasis to Parsons Doleman I have
proved it true. Fourthly, it had been Parsons duty, and so also the duty of
all other priests, Jesuits, and religious persons, to have prayed for her
Majesty and their country, and by preaching to have sought the reformation
that we all desire: and not to have taken this course that he did: to fly away
like false shepherds from the flock of Christ, and to become trumpetors of
invasion, blood, cruelty, and destruction. Our weapons ought to be spiritual:
praeces and lachrymae, prayers and tears, preaching and sufferings for Christ's
sake, according to the practice of all virtuous, religious, pious, and
catholic priests in all ages. I know what father Parsons has written of this
point in an other treatise of his: but his examples do not warrant him, nor his
fellows to deal in this sort as he has done. Fifthly, to rebinde this again
with authority of our omnipotent legifer Christ Jesus when the Samaritanes
refused to receive Christ, did not Saint James and John speak thus to our
Savior (and I dare say in verbo sacerdotis, with a more sincere, true, and
religious zeal, then ever Parsons had in all his practices) Domine vis dicamus
vt ignis descendat de coelo and consumat eos: but Christ turning toward them:
What said he? mary: increpauit illos dicens, nescitis cuius spiritus estis.
They thought (as a good catholic notes upon this place) that they might have
done as Elias did; they imagined that they were led with the spirit of
zeal, and of their masters honor: but indeed ducebantur spiritu vindictae and
terrestri non caelesti. Sixthly, father Parsons and his companions with the rest
of the seditious Jesuits, taking upon them to be viri apostolici, Iesuitical,
or rather Ignatia^ apostles, who by their calling (forsooth) are to preach
throughout all the world, and ought to be tied to no special place longer then
they list: it should have been more agreeable to their dignities and
estimation, to have come amongst us hither into England, as the Apostles did
name whither so ever they went: and by signs and woonders to have converted
their country to the catholic faith: seeing they take upon them a perfection
above priesthood, and will be called new Apostles illuminats, and
extraordinary Rabbis that have more near familiarity and acquaintance with
God then any other. And this had been apostolical dealing indeed. Mary yet
perhaps the case may be altered if they can persuade us that their founder and
first father, having been a captain and a man of war: had some particular
illuminations and privileges from heaven, that, although Christ's Apostles
proceeded with mildness and patience, as we read in the Gospel their master
Christ did (which was a longer course then a Jesuitical humor is able with
patience to endure) yet his the said Ignatius disciples should have leave to
take a shorter way, and that by fire from heaven or hell (if they could) or by
any treachery, cruelty, treason, or what mischief soever, so it were propter
bonum societatis, or ordine ad deum, they were to omit no opportunity or
villainy that might further such their intents. But by their leaves this being a
new and ruffinly course, never heard of for conversion of any nation, they must
show some better testimony then either Angel from heaven, or feind from hell
can afford them, or else we will not believe them to be any other then the
forerunners of Antichrist as co^sorts of Puritans in this their rebellious
doctrine. Seventhly, if father Parsons and his fellows have any such large
commission from their founder, (for from Christ they have it not) as that by
force thereof they might have solicited the Popes holiness and the king of
Spain, by all false and slanderous suggestions (as they did) to undertake that
glorious and worthy act forsooth: yet considering that they only pretend
thereby the good of their country, and the restitution of the catholic faith,
they might have solicited some other prince to have taken in hand that
enterprise, and not to have sought to have put their prince and country into
the hands of the Spaniards: who are at this day reputed throughout all the
world to be the most cruel and bloody nation that lives upon the earth. The
treatise of that worthy Bishop Bartholomeus Cusaus (a Spaniard borne)
dedicated to the last king of Spain, has laid the Spanish proceedings amongst
the west Indians so plainly out in their colors: how many millions of men,
women, and children, they have there murdered: and that with such inhumane
barbarousnesse, and much more then Phalericall cruelty: as until they do
repent them, and are become a new generation, all kingdoms and countries in
the world, are to pray at the least to be delivered from them. But none could
or would (I am persuaded) serve their turns but the Spaniard; whose pride,
ambition, and cruelty has so possessed their hearts: as father Ignatius was
not a righter Spaniard by birth, then our English Jesuits are by imitation.
Eighthly, besides, by framing themselves with all traiterous practices and fury
to assist and set forwrad the Spaniards designements: they have a stronger
conceit, or rather a full persuasion, that when the king had subdued this
realm, neither he, his son, or his daughter would make their residence
here, (for then the Infantaes title, marriage, or placing in the Low Countries
was not dreamed of) but that this kingdom should have been reduced to a
Province, and committed to the government of their society, scil. to father
Parsons our petty Coruine knight, and the rest of his superintende^cie or
society. Which passage though it may seem very strait: yet if ever you see
father Parsons book of intended Reformation, you will find room enough to
put in more odious stuff then I have handled, or am willing to smatter my pen
withal. And therefote think it no marvel if they profess themselves the
very vowed vassals (in effect) of the Spaniard, for I am persuaded in my
conscience that they have consecrated themselves more devoutly to advance the
now king of Spain or his sister to the scepter royal of this land: then they
have to promote the catholic faith. Neither make I any question of it at all:
but that if hereafter any Pope shall cross the Spaniards plots and purposes,
(as like enough they may, England and France with other nations having
hitherto been ever, more respective to the Sea Apostolic, and taken the
defense of Saint Peter's chair more faithfully upon them, then ever Spain did,
till now of late years: which God of his goodness may alter again, and grant
to his church in these nations their woonted flourish) the Jesuits will have
such a fig in store for his Holiness that shall do so, as no Ruebarbe,
Angelica, Mithridate, or other medicine or antidote shall expel the venime,
poison, and infection from his heart: nor any bezar, pearl, gold, or unicorns
horn, long preserve his life after it. And if there be (as there are) shrewd
suspicions in Rome concerning the death of two Popes, two Cardinals, and one
Bishop already but for breaking, or rather intending to break the Jesuits a
little of their obstinate will and unbridled insolency, and only to reform
them in their order: then no marvel at their designements for England, and
much less doubt to be made of: what they would do in such a case if it came to
canuasing for a kingdom.

THE VII. ARTICLE.
Whether (seeing it is proved that the Spanish invasion was traitorously
procured by father Parsons means) did he then also and some others by his
procurement, move her Majesty's subjects to disobey her highness, to take arms
against her, to surprise her person if they could, and to join their forces
with the Spaniard 1588. affirming that it was lawful for them so to do, or
not? And whether might any of her Majesty's subjects lawfully have followed
their counsel therein?

THE ANSWER.
THey did solicit, stir up and move her Majesty's subjects, as it is here
deduced: we cannot deny it, greater is our grief. But it was not lawful for
any honest man or true catholic borne under English allegiance to have
followed their advise. And this our general opinion of the seculars, is no
small comfort unto many a devout catholic, whose tender consciences have been
by the Jesuits false pretended zeal mightily perplexed a long time with many
doubts, as not knowing what to do in this case of obedience to his holiness and
their sovereign. Therefore I say in few: that as concerning the first part of
this article, it might have been a sufficient argument of Master Parsons hatred
both toward her Majesty, and toward his native country to have solicited
the pope and the king of Spain with so great importunity, to have assailed
this kingdom with their own forces: though he and the rest of his crew, had
left her Majesty's subjects to have (at the least) taken their own courses (as
God should have moved their hearts) and not have troubled himself so much in
persuading them with great torments of mind (in many) to have run with him,
and such like miscreants (as he is) into the pit of perdition for company, to
satiate his insatiable desires. But their malice, pride and ambition are so
infinite in their actiuitie and operation: as there is no mischief or villainy,
which they will not attempt, to further their most savage and Turkish
designements. It was much, that one (a clergy man, possessed and seduced at
that time by the Jesuits) did justify the treacherous dealings of certain
English subjects, in betraying the trust committed unto them, by her Majesty;
and therewithal upon Jesuitical persuasions, did also furthermore exhort
others her highness subjects to do the like. Mary the course that was held by
them at this time 1588. passes all Gods forbod: as our phrase is. But yet will
the facing Jesuits so face out this matter, as I shall not be credited herein,
except I make the same as clear, as day at noonetide, when the sun is
brightest. Therefore to lay open the case in plain terms: you shall
understand that in the said Declaration and Admonition before mentioned, father
Parsons in the good Cardinals name (whom he had bewitched) does stretch all his
rhetorike to the furthest extent, with so great art and cunning, used therein:
as sure, great pity it is, that ever so good a wit as his Grace had, should
have been so mightily abused by that coosening mate: and that they both were
given over so far at that time, as that they should employ such good gifts to
so wicked a purpose. For first they make their entrance into their discourse
with a most odious and shameful declamation against her Majesty: thereby to
stir up her subjects hearts to contempt of her highness, and to make her be
holden every where for odious to God, to the world and all men. I will not
trouble you with the particulars: but verily I am persuaded, that Don Lucifer
the wittiest fiend in hell could not have written more spitefully. Secondly,
they threaten the nobility, gentry, and all the rest of the inhabitants of
this kingdom, with loss of all their goods, their lands, their lives, and
with damnation besides; except that presently upon the landing of the Spaniards
they joined themselves and all the forces, men, munition, victuals, and
whatsoever else they could make, with that catholic army (forsooth.) For the
words be these: If you will avoid (say they) the Popes, the kings, and other
princes high indignation: let no man of what degree soever obey, abette, aid,
defend or acknowledge her etc. adding, that otherwise they should incur the
Angels curse and malediction: and be as deeply excommunicated as any: because
that in taking her Majesty's part they should fight against God: against their
lawful king: against their country: and that notwithstanding all they should
do, they should but defend her highness, booteles to their own present
destruction and eternal shame. Thirdly, after all these and many other such
like threats in a high and military style to scarre bugs with: then they come
to some more mild persuasions, and promise the noble men, that so they join
with the Duke of Parma upon the receipt of their Admonition: they will entreat
that their whole houses should not perish. Parsons did instigate the good
Cardinal, to swear by his honor and in the word of a Cardinal: that in the
fury of their intended massacre, there should as great care be taken of every
catholic and penitent person as possibly could be: and that he was made a
Cardinal of purpose to be sent then into England for the sweet managing of
those affairs. Fourthly, other arguments they used, ^^wne from the certainty
of the victory: as that all the protestants would either turn their coats,
copies, arms, or fly away in fear, and torment of the angel of God
prosecuting them: that although none of her Majesty's subjects should assist
the Spaniards: yet their own forces which they brought with them, were strong
enough: their provision sufficient: their appointment passing: that they had
more expert captains, then her Majesty had good soldiers: all resolute to die
in the cause which they had undertaken: that the blood of all the blessed
Bishops shed in this land, and all the Saints in heaven prayed for the
Spaniards victory: that all the virtuous priests of our country both at home
and abroad, had stretched forth their sacred hands to the same end: that many
priests were in the camp to serve every spiritual man's necessity: that their
forces were guarded with all Gods holy angels: with Christ himself in the
sovereign sacrament: and with the daily most holy oblation of Christ's own
dear body and blood: that the Spaniards being thus assisted with so many
helps: though they had been never so few, they could not loose: and that her
Majesty and her assistants wanting these help, although they were never so
fierce, never so proud, never so many, never so well appointed, yet they could
not prevail: fear you not (say they to such as would take their part) they
cannot. And thus far out of their said Jesuitical Admonition.

Now what say you reverend priests and you dear catholics of all estates to
this pernicious book: wherein he would persuade you that all the priests in
England and out of it, prayed for the heavy desolation and utter downfall,
ruin, and destruction of our native country, and us all in very deed. Well,
he therein lies falsely: but let him go. What prayers he and his made, they
themselves know: for our parts, we were happy many of us, that we never so much
as once dreamed of such matters. But as for the Jesuits faction what say you:
was it not time for them to burn this book? Will not those that escaped the
fire be an everlasting monument of their ignominy and shame? God has set a
brand upon them for false prophets, to be ever hereafter hated and eschewed.
Their blessings turned into cursings, and those whom they cursed God did
bless. Confusion and shame fell upon her Majesty's enemies: and the crown of
an incredible victory has adorned her head for ever. The contrary in every
thing fell out, to that which they prophesied. Their valiant captains fled:
their strength, their provision, their passing appointment, and whatsoever else
they had, served not their turns: their hearts were daunted, and the world has
judged them to have cried crauen, as the speech is in cock pits. But that
which they speak of divine assistants does trouble me most. What will our
common adversaries say, and what may they not say: in that an army assisted so
mightily with angels, with martyrs, with priests, with the blessed sacrament,
and with the daily sacrifice, should speed so evil? If I had Elias spirit,
assuredly the filthy plague of leprosy should never leave them, nor any of
their society, that ever should approve this their so profane abusing of
those divine mysteries. Furthermore, in that they said, that all the priests
abroad and at home, prayed for the Spaniards good success. I am persuaded not
any one unless they were Iesuited, did so: and sure I am that a great many did
rather quite contrary. And therefore (as I said before) they lied falsely: yea,
many of them at home (as I have heard some of them auow it) knew not of the
coming of the army, till it was scattered: and others wished in their hearts
that the pope and the king of Spain had not taken that course with her
Majesty. And as for the priests that were in the camp, such of them (I doubt
not) as were of the Jesuitical humor did thrust themselves into that bloody
service headlong. But sure I am withal, that some others, who were of a more
mild and catholic spirit, were compelled to be in that camp, full sore
against their wills; as some of them have often confessed as much unto me, upon
occasion of speech betwixt us. Also they tell us of the indignation of certain
princes, that her Majesty's subjects should incur, if they showed not
themselves rebels and traitors to her highness, in assisting the Spaniards: as
also that in taking her Majesty's part they should fight against their lawful
king. Who would have thought that any Jesuit living, nay any strumpet (were
they never so impudent) could have put upon them such brazen foreheads? I am
persuaded, that as many Englishmen as should have joined with the Spaniards,
the very Spaniards themselves would afterward in their hearts have detested
them. And then much less, would any prince living have approved such
treachery and treason. And for the lawful king they speak of: it is too too
vile, traitorous and indigne a speech, worthier to be buried in hell, then
printed in any book, head or heart. And therefore to be heartily wished and
prayed for at Gods hands, that they may never live good day in England or
elsewhere being Englishmen borne, that do either now or shall hereafter, honor
or acknowledge, any Sovereign of this kingdom but Queen Elizabeth whilst
God shall prolong her days. Concerning also the Cardinals honor and promise:
alas good man, there was never person of so high a place, more inueigled then
he was, by that false Jesuit Parsons. It has been confessed by some of the
Jesuits themselves, in the hearing of sundry witnesses, that the Duke of Medina
Sidonia openly affirmed upon occasion of speech, that his sword could find
no difference (as he thought) betwixt an heretic and a catholic: his business
was to make a way for his Master, which he meant to do, and intended no less
as before is said. And this may suffice for that matter of moving her
Majesty's subjects to rebellion.

But I have run too long upon this point: I trust it appears by all that
hitherto has been said, what Parsons and his fellows drift was in persuading
her Majesty's subjects to rebellion, etc. therefore now I come to the second
part of the article: which is, that no honest man might lawfully have followed
their council. And first, if the said persuasions were absurd, untrue,
irreligious, and wicked. It follows, that no man might without sin have
yielded unto them. Secondly, titles to kingdoms are not impeached, either by
the law of nature, or by testimony of Scripture, as you shall hear hereafter
out of a great Doctor propter defectionem a fide: ergo the duty of subjects
does continue, and is not dissolved in respect of any such defection. Thirdly,
Nabuchodonozer was as great an enemy in his time to the church and city of
God as could be imagined, he destroyed all before him, and led the people away
captive into Babell. And yet hear what commandments the prophets Jeremy and
Abacuk gave to the Elders, priests, prophets, and to all the people that were
in captivity: and consider how unlike they are to father Parsons speeches
before mentioned. Seek the prosperity of that city whither I have caused you
to be carried away captive, and pray unto the God of heaven for it. For in the
peace thereof shall you have peace. And that worthy Abacuk said further: Pray
for the life of Nabuchodonozer king of Babylon, and for the life of Balthazar
his son, that their days may be upon earth as the days of heaven: and that
God would give us strength and lighten our eyes, that we may live under the
shadow of Nabuchodonozer king of Babylon, and under the shadow of Balthazar his
son, and that we may long do them service and find favor in their sight.
Fourthly, the same obedience that here is prescribed, to these wicked kings:
did Christ himself and his apostles prescribe and practice in their times to
heathenish princes, Emperors and governors. Our Savior paid tribute both for
himself, and Saint Peter, and gave a general commandment to all subjects to
do the like, both then and for ever after. For so I understand his precept:
give unto Caesar that which is Caesar's. Fifthly, and as touching the Apostles:
Saint Peter and Saint Paul, they are most plain and most earnest that all
subjects without exception, should submit themselves unto the authority of
those wicked emperors and governors that then reigned (in which number Nero
himself was) propter dominum: because it was the will of God that it should be
so: and that they should obey them not only for fear, but for conscience.
Sixthly, there is an argument that carries some pretty show, which may be
framed from a good rule of Cardinal Bellarmines. It is apparent that the word
of God does prescribe obedience to wicked princes: and it is also as apparent,
that the laws of the church (as in our case) do forbid obedience to such
princes. Now says the said Cardinal (but in another matter) Quando ius diuinum
and ius humanum pugnant: debet seruari ius diuinum omisso humano. Seventhly,
Justinius Martyr, Athenagoras, and Tertullian have notably expressed this duty
of subjects to the civil magistrates, be what they shall good or bad. And
though then they were very profane men, and cruel persecutors many of them:
yet they labored very earnestly to show, that by the doctrine of Christ
himself, of all his holy apostles, and the whole church his sweet spouse: it
was the duty of all Christians, living under them and being borne their
subjects, to serve and obey them in all their temporal affairs and causes of
imploiment. Vectigalia and collectiones, etc. There are none of your subjects
(says Justinius to the Emperor) that pay their tributes, customs, and
collections to such officers as you appoint to collect them, sooner then we do:
that be Christians. Sic instituti sumus: for we are so taught, etc. to give
unto Caesar that which is Caesar's. And again, Nos solum deum adoramus, and
vobis in alijs rebus laeti inseruimus. Likewise Athenagoras to the Emperor
Antonius: pro imperio vestro, etc. The Christians do power out their vows and
prayers to God for your empire: that the son may succeed the father, and the
empire may long increase and flourish. And Tertullian of like sort says: we
pray with all our hearts, that God will grant to all Emperors, a long life, a
secure empire, an obedient family, valiant armies, a faithful Senate, honest
subjects, a quiet government, and whatsoever is acceptable unto them. Eighthly,
but least it should be objected that there is difference between heathen kings
and such, as being once true Christians and catholics: as al Christians are by
baptism) are apostataed out of the church: and therefore though subjects are
bound to obey the first sort, yet it follows not, that they, are so bound to
the second. To this I answer, that although the difficulty be cleared in my
second reason before set down: yet S. Augustine shall make the point more
manifest. Ordinauit sic deus ecclesia^ suam, etc. God has so ordered his
church: as all ordinary authority and magistrates may have in this world honor
done unto them: and aliquando a melioribus: and sometime from their betters.
Contigit tibi, etc. It happens that thou art become a Christian, having a
master: non ideo Christianus factus es vt dedigneris seruire: thou art not
therefore made a Christian that thou should think scorn to serve thy
master still. O quantum etc. O how much are rich and great men bound unto
Christ: who so orders their families, as if there be in them, a servant that
is an infidel, Christ does convert him: and non ei dicit: and does not say
unto him: serve thy master no longer: because now thou know him, who is
indeed thy true Lord and master. Yea, but such a servant may say: Indignum est
vt iustus and fidelis seruiat iniquo and infideli: It is not meet that a just
and faithful man should serve a wicked master being an infidel. Whereunto
Saint Augustine answers: non hoc ei dixit: sed magis vt seruiat. A servant
may say so: but Christ never told him so: but that being a Christian, he should
the rather continue his service to such a one his master. If Christ himself
the Sovereign Lord of heaven and earth seruiuit indignis, did obey wicked
rulers: prayed for them being persecutors: quanto magis: how much more ought
man not to disdain to serve his Lord and master with all his mind, with his
whole good will, and with perfect love: etiam malo, though he be a wicked man.
Quod autem dixi de domino, etc. And what I have said of the master and servant;
understand the same of powers and kings, and of all other superiors of this
world. Sometimes they are good and fear God: and sometimes they fear not God.
And so he comes to the place which I have all this while aimed at. Iulianus
extitit infidelis: and was he not also an apostata, a wicked man and an
idolater? But Christian soldiers served the Emperor an Infidel: when they came
to a cause that touched Christ his honor, they acknowledged none but him that
was from heaven: when he would have had them to have served Idols, and have
offered sacrifice unto them, they preferred God before the Emperor. But when he
said unto them bring forth your forces: go against such a nation, they
presently obeyed. They distinguished their eternal Lord from their temporal
Lord: and yet they were subject unto their temporal Lord in respect of his
will: who is their eternal Lord. Thus far Saint Augustine: whereby I trust
it is plain: that kings are to be obeyed by their subjects, whether they be
wicked persons, heretics, apostataes, or worse if worse could be.

Besides all these general reasons before mentioned; why no good subjects
ought to give ear to such traitorous counselors as Parsons and his fellows
were 1588. and so still continue: there yet are some more particular and more
pertinent respects, why her Majesty's subjects ought not to have regarded any,
or all their said Jesuitical persuasions before mentioned for their joining
with the Spaniards. First, the excommunication of Pius 5. having been procured
upon false suggestions, and so by surreption: it has ever been thought by the
grauer and more learned priests and catholics in England to have been void and
of no validity in law from the beginning. And the same opinion is held of both
the renouations: partly in that a renouation of that which is not, is void:
and partly also for that the instigations, as Parsons has set them down, are
many of them false, and all exceeding malicious. Which opinions being true: in
what case were they, that were animated with the first excommunication to
rebellion 1569. and in what case should they have been, that should have
followed the Jesuits councels, 1588? Surely they were, and have been traitors
both before God and man. Secondly, there are so many questions of the nullities
of excommunications, as it will always be found a very hard matter for
subjects to discern when they are so far to regard them, as that with safe
consciences they may take up arms against their sovereigns: upon pretense
that they are excommunicated. Thirdly, a great uncertainty rises amongst the
schoolmen concerning the denouncing of any such excommunication: when it may
be thought to be so sufficient, as that the subjects of any king are bound to
take notice of it. And peradventure if the matter were well looked into, there
was never hitherto any such denuntiation of any excommunication against her
Highness, as by the Canon law it is required. So as in that respect, it had
been unlawful for her Majesty's subjects to have yielded to father Parsons
traitorous inticements. Sure I am that many catholics do not yet believe that
there was ever any such an excommunication at all: but that it is a mere
slander, devised by our common enemies, to make all catholics odious.
Fourthly, I cannot easily devise (as matters are now a days handled) how it
is possible that subjects (besides the former vncerteinties) should ever take
sure and infallible notice of any excommunication said to be denounced against
their king, so as they may obey it, and with safe consciences disobey their
Sovereign. It was either a simple or a most insolent conceit of father
Parsons, or of the good (though maruelously abused) Cardinal: to think, that
their bare words, could in any reasonable man's judgment be conceived, to be a
sufficient warrant for English catholics to have armed themselves against her
Majesty. And for any other authority or warrant of Xistus the 5. his
renouation of the former excommunication: I never yet heard of it. But
howsoever it were: yet sure I am, that no other notice was to have been given
of it. For after they have told a long and spiteful tale in their said
declaration and admonition touching the Popes and the king of Spaines
designements against her Majesty: they use these words, scil. Of whose
proceedings in this action: and as well of his holiness as his majesty's
intention and meaning therein: we are to advertise you all by these presents.
And again. Be it notified to the inhabitants of that country etc. Likewise be
it known that the intention of his holiness, etc. Moreover be it known by
these presents: that it shall not only be lawful for any person public or
private to arrest (the Queen) but also be held for very good service, etc.
Here we hear of nothing, that his holiness says or commands in his own
name, under his pastoral and authentike seal: but the credit of these two
men, should have carried her Majesty's subjects to the most infamous and
inconvenient action that ever happened in Christendom. Whereas in good faith, to
speak my conscience: the Cardinal standing so bewitched with that Machiuilean
Jesuit Parsons, and they writing thus much both together; their testimonies
ought not to have moved any man to a much less mischief then this had been.
Some late experience we have had as touching our Archpriest, how boldly some
Cardinals will adventure to abuse the Sea apostolic: and the sacred
disposition of the Popes holiness, to serve their own turns therewith. Yea was
not all the whole consistory and Cardinals of his holiness palace, unless it
were two, most bitterly bent against S. Thomas of Canterbury. Insomuch as
finding him at dinner with a capon on Saint Marks day, they would have
delivered him up, as a lollard: had not God bewraied their malice, by a miracle
in defense of the holy and innocent man and blessed prelate: turning the capon
into a carpe: to show, that his weakness was the cause of breaking the Churches
orders, for abstinence from flesh that day. Whereupon followed that in that
street at Rome and here in England, within the bishopric of Canterbury ever
since, it has been dispensed withal, to eat flesh as lawfully upon that
day, as any other. So as you see how the Pope his holiness, may and often is
mightily deluded, abused, and prejudiced by false informations of some
particular persons, and that thereupon (as I have told you before) he may err
as a private man, in not knowing the case aright, and by consequent
excommunicate, suspend etc. wrongfully: which although catholics are bound to
obey in some cases (as before is said) that may concern their spiritual
punishments, in depriving them for a time of the sacraments of Gods Church: yet
can I never find that it staid any from their temporal allegiance to their
Sovereign, or withdrew them that otherwise were loyal subjects from defense
of their native country against any whosoever: Nay in the case proposed,
considering the ticklish estate of things as now they stand, and what danger
catholics are in on every side: adding hereunto the Jesuitical humor; I say
then (to proceed a little further) that although the Popes own Bull had been
so, and to have been it self published in the most authentical manner that
might have been well devised: yet such is the falsehood of the Jesuits, and
such is their favor in Rome, and so shamefully they dare presume to inform
his holiness: as certainly it had been no sufficient warrant for her Majesty's
subjects to have entered into that course, which father Parsons moved them
unto. And except those false hypocrites be kept in more awe and curbed from
daring to intermeddle with his holiness actions in such manner of matters of so
important, weighty and dangerous consequences: the authority of the Court of
Rome will be greatly prejudiced in their proceedings, and they will not let his
holiness be in quiet till they have set him at a jar with his best and most
faithful subjects and servants in Christendom: as we see in part already by
their indeuouring to bring into disgrace the whole clergy, secular priests,
religious orders, bishops and all; that they themselves may live at riot and
rule, range and reign at their pleasures. Fifthly, to confirm then the
premises, I say then, that let the renouation be as it was, and father Parsons
persuasions go as they are: yet the very law agreed upon amongst all our
Canonists does allow the servants or subjects of any Lord or king
excommunicated to perform in five cases their duties and allegiance unto them:
nay they are bound unto it. Haec anathema faciunt ne possit obesse: vtile, lex,
humile, res ignorata, necesse. First, if their service be profitable for their
Lords or for themselves. Secondly, the very law of nature (I think) does allow
such duties: as of the wife to her husband excommunicated: and the same reason
is of the servant to his master, or the subject to his prince. Thirdly,
excommunication does not deliver a servant or a subject from his former
condition: it finding him in the state of a subject or servant, does not
debar him from doing his duty. Fourthly, if the subject do not know that
his sovereign is excommunicated, then is not he thereby either infected or
affected: and of the uncertainty of any such knowledge, you have heard before.
Nay though the subjects do know it never so assuredly: yet any of the former
three cases do serve their turns for the continuance of their allegiance.
Fifthly, but that which follows, necesse: necessity is without all exception,
as the saying is, necessitas non habet legem, though the Pope should attempt in
person any thing against any prince or king, under what pretense soever: yet
necessity will always excuse their subjects for not obeying his holiness bulls
in temporal duties: and for performing their said duties and services unto
their sovereigns. The Schoolmen do make sundry kinds of necessities: as
necessitas adesse suppliciter: and adesse secundum quid and ad been esse etc.
which I will not trouble you withal.

You shall see the very point it self set down in express terms, concerning
the catholics of England that live at this day under her Majesty. The
faithful of England and Saxony (says Bannes) are to be excused: qui se non
eximant a potestate superiorum, nec bellum contra illos gerunt, quoniam
communiter non habent facultatem ad haec bella gerenda contra principes, and
imminent illis grauia pericula: who do not exempt themselves from the power of
their superiors, nor bear arms against them: because generally they have no
ability to wage such wars against their princes, and great danger does hang
over their heads if they should attempt it. And a little before he says: that
subjects are not bound to war against their sovereign, or to exempt
themselves from their subjection cum periculo mortis and amissione bonorum:
with the danger of their lives, and loss of their goods: and so ends his
resolution with an and caetera: as if he should have said, there are also many
other such like exceptions to be allowed of. And G. de Valencia agrees with
Bannes. For (says he) when the Popes holiness does absolve subjects from their
oaths of allegiance, that they may not be bound to perform their duties to
their Lords that are excommunicated, and do forbid them likewise so to do:
they are thus to be understood, scil. that they are not otherwise bound to obey
them in those cases: but si nimirum negare obsequium dominis suis possint
absque notabili suo detrimento: ita enim hoc est intelligendum, sicut recte
notauit Bannes: that is, When they may refuse to obey their Lords and masters
without any notable hurt or loss to themselves: for so these kinds of
absolutions and forbiddings are to be understood, as Bannes has well observed.
And Master Parsons of his goodness strikes this matter dead. For in his said
Admonition he is pleased to tell the catholics of England and all other her
Majesty's subjects in these words following: that in cases of evident danger
the censures of the Church, so far as they concern only temporal matters,
by the meaning of him that gave the sentence, do not bind. Now it might
peradventure prove a very probable position as the world stands at a gaze:
whether it may easily be conceived by a man of a dull conceit that any king
will be ever so negligent or careless of his own estate: or if he should,
whether any counselors of any kingdom will ever be so improuident for the
safety of their sovereigns authority, kingdom and life: as that it shall
not always be dangerous for their subjects to rebel, and take arms against
them. And then every man may see what follows: that as Saint Paul said,
Multa mihi licita sunt, quae tamen non expediunt: so questionles I am of that
mind, that it will not be expedient for the Popes holiness to intermeddle with
the excommunicating of princes in these days. For assuredly it will seldom
fall out (if ever) that subjects without danger shall be able by rebellion to
put such a sentence in execution: besides the incertainties before specified,
that it cannot well be imagined how they should in these dangerous times take
sufficient notice of it, when so great and general a jealousy on the one side
is had of all princes, and so manifest signs of intolerable abuses, falsehood,
and malepertnes on the other side in the Jesuitical faction, to procure
whatsoever may serve their own turns for the time without all or any respect
had of God or man, Pope or prince, church or common wealth, catholic or
heretic. And sure it cannot be but that all princes as well spiritual as
temporal, will more narrowly look into the Jesuits doings then heretofore
they have: when they shall duly consider what danger they all do stand in (yea
even those that now favor these seditious busy headed bodies most) if these
factious companions may procure excommunications at their pleasure and provoke
his holiness to strike with ecclesiastical censure whatsoever offends any of
them, nay whosoever does not please and content them in all things: nay more,
whosoever has that which they have a mind to, and that they cannot otherwise
have their wish and unlawful desire: out goes a slander, that he or she are
of lewd demeanor not established in the grace of God; and in few, are
reprobates, of God forsaken, and then straightwaies must his holiness strike
them with excommunication etc. or else shall he also be holden for a Lutheran
or fautor of wicked persons and heretics.

In confirmation of the premises: here it offers it self fitly to this
purpose: what father Criton the great Scots statist said to an honorable person
in talk of these matters concerning the excommunication of his Majesty king
James. This noble Lord having heard some speeches against the Scots king blown
abroad by fa. Parsons his under Agents at Bruxels (such be like as that base
fellow Verstegen, who having no more gentleman's blood in his body then in a
coupers son, nor scant so much of such a breed may the couper be) yet took
upon him to cotize our English nobles and gentles there, affirming that there
were not past three or four in those coasts of all our nation that were of
any noble or generous blood, coat armor, and ancestrie, scil. the Earl of
Westmerland, the Lord Dacres, and as I remember, the next was himself or sir
William Stanley, I know not whether: but either sir knight or sir knave was in
the third place. Whereupon followed a foul ado in the Flemmish court for a
while, sundry of noble and generous blood, being mightily disgraced by this
base companions information given to the prince in derogation to our English
gentry. And this vntriall gentleman was one of that nobleman father Parsons
spies, intelligencers and blazoners of what infamies as were to be conveyed
thence abroad into Italy, Spain, France, and other countries adjoining.
Amongst other things that might be thought to endanger his royal person most:
one passage was this; that father Parsons with others of the zealous
illuminates and more resolute, wise, religious, learned and grave fathers and
other catholics had dealt very seriously with the Popes holiness about
excommunicating of the said king: which was expected every hour to come forth
and to be promulgated against his highness etc. Whereof the foresaid Lord being
desirous to know of father Criton whether any such thing were or not, and
withal whether his own subjects or others that wished well unto him might
lawfully defend his rightful title or no, he being by father Parsons
definitive sentence denounced an obstinate heretic: and one of whom there was
no possibility or hope of reclaiming from his heretical opinions: the said
father Criton answered, saying: My Lord, doubt you nothing thereof, it is but
father Parsons devise to endanger his Majesty's person thereby: knowing that
the Scots are a false, traitorous and a rebellious people: quickly taking
occasion to murder or otherwise rise in arms against their liege Lord and
king. True it is indeed that father Parsons and other English Jesuits, and
those that are of the Spanish faction have labored it much, to have the
sentence denounced against his Majesty: but hitherto they have not prevailed,
neither do I think that ever you shall see it, because no Scots will seek for
it. And Popes are always sparing, unless they be mightily importuned and
urged, as both Pius quintus and Xistus quintus were by father Parsons and other
Jesuits procurement against our own Sovereign and Queen. Lo what evil hap
England had to breed this wicked Jesuitical brood, that seek their princes
and countries destruction, more egarly then any other Jesuits do the nations
and country where they live.

THE VIII. ARTICLE.
Whether then (because by the precedent article it seems very dangerous) is
it expedient for the Church in these latter days of the world to excommunicate
kings: and whether was it a good and godly act in certain of her Majesty's
subjects, such as desired to seem more zealous then the rest to persuade Pius
quintus to excommunicate her highness, and since also other Popes to renew the
same twice.

THE ANSWER.
VEry well said Saint Paul (as erst I noted) Multa mihi licita sunt, sed non
omnia expediunt. For it is one thing to talk of the power, authority, and
lawfulnes of excommunications: and an other of the time, place and persons when
the sentence is denounced: therefore as we say, ex effectibus cognoscitur
causa; so by demonstration a posteriori, it is manifest to all our woes that
excommunicating of princes is not convenient in this irreligious and most
unfortunate age. Neither did they well that either stirred up Pius quintus first
to excommunicate her highness, or these that since have urged other Popes to
renew the same: And therefore in answer to both the points of this article, I
hold the negative. And for the first, these are my reasons. First, when Saint
Ambrose excommunicated the emperor Theodosius, it was a time of greater zeal:
and otherwise Saint Ambrose might thereby have procured unspeakable detriment
to the Church. In my private cogitations hereof, I have assuredly often doubted
whether Saint Ambrose deserved more commendation for his prouidencie in
attempting such a matter: or the emperor for his patience and obedience in
taking the same in so good part. But yet I hold it out of all question, that if
Saint Ambrose had inserted any such clauses into the said excommunication, as
of latter times are used, and should in plain terms have deposed him, or
labored to have had him deposed from his empire, or absolved his subjects from
their obedience: the emperor would have startled: and I cannot tell, but by all
likelihood he would not have obeyed it, but rather have put all to the sword,
that should have withdrawn themselves from under his allegiance. Secondly, I
find certain words in Saint Thomas which make me to marvel, in that he says
out of the gloss: that Princeps and multitudo non est excommunicanda: or as
Rich. de Media Villa alleges the place, neither the multitude nor the prince
ought to be excommunicated. And the most of the Schoolmen that write upon S.
Thomas in this place, do agree with him: that a multitude is not to be
excommunicated, or if it be, some hold that such an excommunication is void.
But let it be their error, yet still they omit therein the other part as
touching kings and princes, and do say nothing concerning the validity of it
in that place: only the said Richardus de Media Villa does touch this point
somewhat to our purpose, for the inconueniencie thereof; but in mine opinion
very weakly: for that any thing be it never so plain may easily be so
avoided. A king (says S. Thomas) ought not to be excommunicated: that is
(says Richardus) but in maioribus peccatis: for great offenses. As if we
should think that ever S. Thomas thought so meanly of the wisdom, judgment
and discretion of the Church: that she would excommunicate princes for every
trifle. Nay if that should be his meaning, he had alleged the said place very
ridiculously: which is far from Saint Thomas course and practice. Thirdly,
besides whereas some inconveniences are made the impediments why a multitude
may not be excommunicated, there may very many more reasons of mischiefs be
objected that do ensue by the excommunicating of princes, which consequently
should stay that course likewise against them. I have prosecuted this reason
only disputatiue non positive, saluo semper meliori iudicio: let S. Thomas
meaning be what it shall: his words are as I have alleged them here in this
place. Fourthly, it is no good providence in S. Augustines judgment to
excommunicate those that have many followers to take their part: or when the
same may breed a schism. But it is very likely that kings and princes will
always have many followers to take their parts, and that the same may beget
more then a schism. Fifthly, there was no probability of any good success
that could be looked for by excommunicating her Majesty, as by experience
might have been apparent, by the excommunication denounced against king Henry
8. Sixthly, I have made mention before of inconveniences and mischiefs: but if
they may serve the turn to show the inconvenience of an excommunication
against kings, and that I should enter into the enumeration of all the
inconveniences and mischiefs; which have been the effects of both the said
excommunications against her Majesty and against her royal father: it would
appear, that there was never any excommunication more inconvenient, and I
should be exceeding tedious. It may be sufficient that I remember unto you as
touching our own time, how thereby her Majesty and the state have been more
incensed both against the Sea of Rome, and likewise against all catholics;
priests are become most odious; the general cause has been more impaired;
many dangerous questions and straight examinations have thereof proceeded: and
to omit the rest, infinite perplexities and quidities have grown concerning
the consciences of the weaker sort of catholics, when, wherein, and how far
they might profess their allegiance: which have entangled them diversely, and
brought many of them into bands and other great dangers. Seventhly, I am fully
persuaded, that there was yet never any Pope that did ever excommunicate any
king or sovereign prince, but that afterward he saw cause for the most part
in his own time (if he lived any while) to repent him of it, and wish either
it had been undone or in this or that manner, otherwise then it was denounced
and executed.

That which hitherto I have said of the first point of this article, does in
some sort confirm my assertion concerning the second. For if the
excommunication of kings be inconvenient, then what shall we think of those men
being subjects, and in times so dangerous, as never any were more then we now
live in, that did seek either to procure the said excommunication against her
Majesty, or to renew it. As touching the first procurers of it, were it D.
Harding, D. Stapleton, D. Morton, D. Web, all or any of them: they were yet
by their leaves (with reverend regard to their priesthood and doctorship be it
spoken) but simple men out of their positive divinity, and did mightily
ouershoote themselves in it diverse ways. First, there being a rash affection
or zeal (if you will have it so called) in some of the catholic Bishops when
her Majesty began to reign, to have imitated Saint Ambrose by excommunicating
her highness and diverse others: yet (as Master Saunders notes) prudentiores
Episcopi, vel certe mansuetiores: The wiser sort of the^, or surely the milder
were of another opinion, and prevailed. Indeed he further says: that they
altogether thought it meet to refer the consideration of that matter to the
Popes wisdom, to do therein as he thought convenient: but it appears not,
that they did afterward solicit his holiness thereunto. But the contrary
will easily be proved, by some that are alive, who can testify that they were
far from that mind, especially afterward, when they had better considered
what was likely to ensue if any such excommunication should be procured. And it
will likewise be justified sufficiently, that Bishop Watson was exceedingly
grieved, when he heard that Pius quintus had been drawn to that course: as in
his wisdom seeing the great inconvenience of it. Secondly, the same reasons
ought to have hindered the said Parsons and any other from soliciting the Pope
to that censure, which moved those catholic Bishops to forbear it
themselves. They considered (says M. Saunders) that they were the Queens
subjects, and that such a fact might peradventure have procured some tumult and
scandal, and trouble of the whole Ecclesiastical state and order: and also
might probably have stirred up some persecution. Thirdly, if it were true that
some Jesuits have lately written (but with great Machiuillian sleights to
curry favor for the better furtherance of sundry their intended mischievous
designements) that her Majesty was in effect constrained to take the course for
the alteration of religion that she did, when she came first to the crown:
then dealt they therein contrary to the reasonable construction of sundry
canons of the Church, and consequently very rashly and unjustly. Fourthly, it
may be gathered (as I suppose) out of Saint Ambrose by his duty to the
emperor otherwise signified, that it was far from his heart to think of the
deposing of him from the empire, or of absoluing his subjects from their
obedience, if the emperor had withstood him. But these men were of another
humor: they knew that their suit to Pius Quintus did tend to her highness
deposition from the crown (so far as the Bull would reach) and to the raising
up of such a garboyle in the kingdom, as any true catholic heart may justly
quake to think of it. Fifthly, S. Augustine (as S. Thomas observes) would not
praecipitare sententiam: whether is worse a catholic of an evil life, or an
heretic against whose conversation no just exception may be taken. Now it is
well known to all the world, and acknowledged in Spain, what manner of person
a certain king was that once bare a great sway there: and with how many most
notorious and heinous enormities he might truly have been charged: but yet the
Spanish Jesuits and catholics were far from the violent humor of our men:
they did never presume or once endeavor to seek or sue to have their sovereign
excommunicated. Whose example of forbearance therein, does argue the
inconsiderate rashness of our said Iesuited catholics and Jesuits: that have
dealt in such sort as all the world sees, with her Majesty. Sixthly, whereas
diverse kings and absolute princes have rejected the authority of the Sea
Apostolic, as well as her highness, and do still so persevere: yet we find
not that any hitherto of their subjects, priests, Jesuits, or what other
soever, have sought their overthrow, deposition and destruction, as our English
Jesuits by profession, and some other priests in affection and faction Iesuited
have sought for. It is true that in France there are public monuments of
Jesuitical tyranny. For first they procured Henry the third to be
excommunicated; and then by degrees they murdered him. The like course they
also held for a long time with the king now regnant, saving that to their
intolerable grief, the blow which they procured to be given him proved not
mortal: though still their malice and hatred toward him, appears manifestly
to be as extreme as ever it was, and therefore their good wills to be considered
of accordingly. For all which and many more most traitorous practices, the
Jesuits are at this day an odious and detestable generation in that kingdom,
and with great providence and judgment are banished thence for ever. Whereby
we may see what all such persons do deserve, who have amongst us prosecuted
her highness with little less malice and treason, in seeking to have her
Majesty excommunicated, which is made by such miscreants, but an entrance to
all further disloyalty, cruelty and mischief. Seventhly, it is apparent by
the judgment of S. Augustine, that when excommunication cannot be denounced
against any, but with the inconveniences that are in the point before touched,
and are therefore in such cases to be forborne: those counselors that shall
notwithstanding solicit and labor for to procure any such excommunications,
are to be utterly rejected and condemned, as being persons whose counsels are
inania, pernitiosa atque sacrilega, quia and impia and superba sunt, and plus
turbant infirmos bonos, quam corrigunt animosos malos: vain, pernicious and
sacrilegious, because being wicked and proud counsels, they bring greater
trouble to weak good men, then amendment to those that are evil and stout.
For in such cases he says, that those things must be borne with patiently,
that cannot be reformed, without the said inconveniences: and that it is the
duty of good men in the mean while cum dilectione with love and charity to
mourn and lament, and not to take such desperate and wicked courses against
all duty, faith and allegiance, as these men we speak of did, and our
Machiuillian Jesuits do still pursue and endeavor. Eighthly, whereas
excommunication is termed by the learned sort of catholics medicina, a
medicine, that is, such a censure as tends to reform the party censured:
this their traitorous endeavor (for I can term it no better) aimed at nothing
but blood, cruelty and destruction, not only of their sovereign, but an
infinite number besides. For they could not be so absurd as to think, that the
said excommunication was ever like to take effect, without either war or
treachery. Nay it is now plain, that they had then plotted in their hearts a
shameful rebellion, which they did solicit, some of them in person, as soon
as the Pope had satisfied their desire. Ninthly, it is well known that the
chief reasons that moved Pius Quintus to yield unto them, were most falsely
and surreptiously suggested to his holiness, and carried with them very many
absurdities, as this for one, scil. Forsooth the Duke of Norfolk was a most
sound catholic, (which was false:) all the realm would follow him, (which was
absurd:) the Popes pleasure and censure once known to the catholics, there
could be no resistance, (which was ridiculous.) Besides this, a marriage would
follow, that would reform all and work woonders: as if they should have said,
that when the sky falls, they should have store of larkes.

And now to those that procured the renouation of this excommunication at the
times articulated. If the first procurers of it may justly be condemned as you
have heard: what shall we think of them (father Parsons and his associates our
pretended holy fathers of the society of Jesus) that when it lay asleep did
revive it? Certainly they are to be detested of all true catholics and
dutiful subjects to her Majesty.

All that hitherto has been said against the procurers does touch them
nearer, that were the sollicitors to have it renewed: as it may appear (to any
that is not obstinately wilful) for these two reasons. First, for that they
did find by experience the mischief which the other might easily have
foreseen, that is, all the plagues, miseries, calamities and inconveniences
that the denouncing of the said excommunication had already wrought: which
ought to have restrained their madness, considering that the renewing of it
could not choose in any reasonable man's judgment but provoke her Majesty and
the state to greater severity against all catholics: whereof they were in no
danger themselves, being beyond the seas. Then a second reason, was the bad
success, which they also might have noted by all the attempts made, given or
intended against our sovereign and realm, apparently demonstrating thus much
at least to be expected by renewing of the excommunication: scil. a sorrowful
repentance of their after wits too late: right Englishmen in deed, but no way
to be wished for such experimental knowledge of our native dispositions in
matters of so great importance, as in a world greater could not be found. And
howsoever any cause had bin given, yet the case was clear by the effects
ensuing, that it was not Gods will such excommunications, or other practices
should have been used or gone about: especially by such men as father Parsons
and other Iesuited hot spurs: whose profession being far otherwise in
laboring for conversion of countries, the evil succes which he and all his
confederates have had in all their proceedings against princes, does give all
the world to understand that God was not pleased from the beginning with the
Jesuitical courses. Besides the more The old Lord Mountacutes conceit was
marvelous both catholic and loyal, against these new state religious
Jesuits: whose singularity he utterly disliking of, together with their busy
practices and intrusions, would never suffer any of them to come within his
doors, neither yet any other Seminary priest, all such being wrongfully
suspected to be of a Jesuitical disposition, from which humor many were even
from the beginning most free: though some and those too many were infected by
them. But al keeping silence in respect of the common cause, the said
Seminaries and other secular priests and lay catholics were content to undergo
that wrong conceit (had of them with their fellows) with many other
inconveniences and miseries, which they might have avoided if they had sooner
opened themselves and their detestatio^ of such courses. As the only chief
cause (ad hominem) of keeping out so many schismatikes that otherwise would
have been catholics, occasionating also the fall of sundr^ others which
probably would never have shrunk, if fear of intangling with state matters
had not moved them thereunto.
ancient, learned, wise and grauer sort did ever dislike with such kind of
dealings, scil. Cardinal Allan that renowned prelate, he even wept of tender
love to his country, in conceiting what mischiefs the Iesuited Spanish
faction had bred and would hereafter breed to this realm: and Doctor Watson
then Bishop of Lincoln, with others (as it were presaging or prophesying) in
plain terms foretold it: that as things then stood the Jesuits progress in
statizing as they did, would certainly urge the state to make some sharper
laws which should not only touch them: but likewise all other both priests
and catholics as since we all have found it to be most true: diverse others
also of sound judgment in forecasting what might happen by these rebellious,
tumultuous, vnpriestly, and irreligious courses: told father Parsons in plain
terms that unless he did desist from those his vnpriestlike affairs (whereof
one was then to set her Majesty's crown on another head as his letter to an
Earl before mentioned declares) they the said catholics would deliver him up
into the hands of the civil magistrate to make him know they could and would,
put a difference in discerning of a pretense, betwixt religion and treason; and
that they did detest his platform and proceedings to effectuate the same to
the utter destruction, not conversion of our country. So also the succession
of sorrows, which from time to time have fallen upon us all, and especially
the most innocent most tormented, the false traitors flying away, casting of
their load, and laying all upon their backs might woorst and least desired,
deserved, or demerited to have borne it, and leaving the guiltless blood to
bleed, the harmless hearts to wring, the scrupulous catholics perplexed with
many dilemmaes betwixt religion and loyalty, not knowing what to do; did
plainly explane the case: when and how that posteriores cogitationes solent
esse sapientiores: that though experience be called the mistres of fools, yet
is she no foolish mistres: that the Jesuitical plots for restoring religion in
this land by surreptitiall excommunications, depositions, invasions,
massacrings, murthorings, and other treacherous Catelinian coniurations and
conspiracies were not sanctified nor blessed by the hand of God: and that happy
had we all been, that are catholics borne under Englands alleagiance, if
these men being priests and religious persons by profession (as the Jesuits in
their folly would be counted of in chief) had never troubled themselves with
state affairs, nor procured by execution and practice of excommunication a
firebrand of a bloody contentious dispute, to be cast amongst us. And as no
doubt the original cause of religious change, came for the offenses of our
forefathers to be radicated in the mournful effects we now behold, both
clergy and laity highly offending: so the succceding occasions of erroneous
conceits, has been our own faults, in treading our forefathers steps in
this point of private respects, self conceits, and high aspires. So as justly
we may say, Non sumus digni a Deo exaudiri: but rather and most true it is that
nostris demeritis meremur puniri: and that the fault is not in her Majesty,
nor honorable Council, nor civil magistrate, nor all, nor any of our
adversaries: but in our selves, that England is not yet converted, and our
persecution of long time still increased, scil. by reason of some seditious
persons, and others that followed them with indiscreet zeal, and those that
were in expectance of great matters by a change, converting their thoughts from
heavenly hopes to earthly hazards: employing their studies, how to compass
their own ambitious aduancements: God highly offended to see his blessings and
graces lost and taken from amongst us for our forefathers sins, to be gone
about by the like and worse proceedings, to have it restored again. It could
not otherwise choose but grievously offend the divine majesty, and until the
archplotters of this preposterous course for our countries conversion, were
either cut off, or otherwise had humbled themselves: and (surceasing from all
ambitious aspires) sought sincerely the health of souls, not heaps of gold;
England should never be converted. But we all die and pine away, leaving the
atchieuement to those that shall succeed in our places, when we are all dead
and gone. That the Jesuits of the more fiery, hot, and Puritanian humor may not
snuff at the quiet that catholics are here said to have liue^ in eleven
years, you shall hear the very words of two of their great Rabbis Parsons
and Creswels speaking to her Majesty in a Puritanian style, as follows. In
the beginning of thy kingdom thou did deal something more gently with
catholics, none were urged by thee, or pressed either to thy sect, or to the
denial of their faith. All things in deed did seem to proceed in a far
milder course, no great complaints were heard of, no extraordinary contentions
or repugnancies. Some there were that to please and gratify you, went to your
churches. But when afterward thou did begin to wring them etc. Which
whenever it was, we were the cause, as the attempts in France and Scotland
make it manifest.


This then being the course and cause of humane hopes, our hearts do bleed to
read and hear (as sundry of us have) what has been printed and published
out of Italy in the life of Pius Quintus concerning the endeavors of his
holiness (stirred up by false suggestions) to join with the king of Spain for
the utter ruin and overthrow both of our prince and country. Would God such
things had never been enterprised, and more, that they had never been
printed: but most of all that they never had fronted our native shores. And if
Parsons and his associates had not busied themselves with that they should nor,
then had we not now meddled in this place with that we would not: as whereunto
for a just defense of all loyal catholic subjects, ignorant of Parsons and
his accomplices drifts, we are now constrained to make appeals, apologies and
replies. For what good soever the first or again renewing of the
excommunication, the printing and reprinting of state books and other
practices may bring hereafter to the Church of God: we neither see it, neither
know it. But sure we are that for the present, nothing has done us greater
harm, nor given our common enemies greater advantages against us. It is
elsewhere set down how that her Majesty used us kindly for the space of the
first ten years of her highness reign, the state of the catholics in England
that while was tolerable, and after a sort in some good quiet. Such as for
their conscience were imprisoned or in durance, were very mercifully dealt
withal (the state and change of things then considered) some being appointed
to remain with such their friends as they themselves made choice of: others
were placed with Bishops, and others with Deanes, and had their diets at their
tables with such convenient walks and lodgings as did well content them. They
that were in ordinary prisons, had all such liberty and commodities as the
place and their estate could afford them: yea even thus much and more does
Parsons confess in his Philopater: as also father Creswell in his Scribe to
the like effect: though both very rude, peremptory and saucy in their speech
to her Majesty, with thou did this, and thou did that etc. And Parsons in
Grenecoate makes the case clear especially for state matters, though he turn
his passage there against the Earl of Leicester, to a wanton speech as
delivered from a Lady of the Court: how great quiet the state and Court was in,
for twelve years space: no talk of treasons nor conspiracies, no iealousies
nor suspicions, no envy nor supplantations, no fear of murtherings nor
massacrings, no question of conscience nor religion, all lived in quiet
content, and right good fellowship was amongst them, both Lords and Ladies,
wives and maidens, nobles and gentles, knights and esquires, married and
single, of all degrees: a joy it was to have been in the Court in those days
(says Parsons in that Ladies name, whose words moved much the company where
she was (as women says he, are potent in moving where and when they please)
she did deliver her mind with so sweet a countenance and courtly a grace etc.)
Now whiles you were (say our adversaries) thus kindly used of her highness, how
trecherously was she dealt withal by you? For what had you to do being
catholics and religious priests, as Jesuits term themselves, with spreading
pamphlets, libels, and other fooleries abroad of any misdemeanor in her
Majesty's subjects and peers of the realm? You might have left such scoggerie
as Parsons has set out in Greenecoate, to Tarleton, Nashe, or else to some
Puritan Martin Mar prelate, or other like companions. And for you it was to
have handled grauer, higher and more important matters: and that concerning
soul points, not subtilties nor new devises; much less to have dealt against
her Majesty and the state in so traitorous a manner, as in a late treatise set
out by our brethren, does at large appear. Where to our unspeakable grief the
world shall see, that we our selves, who would be termed catholics, and that
of all sorts, have been the true causes of all our own calamities. When I was
examined before some of the high Commissioners at the Gildhall about 14. years
agone, concerning matters of state, and especially about the six
Interrogatories (which we commonly called the six bloody articles:) knowing my
self innocent from the beginning of any the least disloyal thought: I have
often since much mused with my self, what should have moved her Majesty's
honorable Council to have proposed these articles to priests: but most of all
why such strait laws were made for coming into England of Seminary priests,
bringing in of Agnus Dei, crosses, medals, grains etc. reconcilement
persuasions to the catholic faith, and the like: All which when I saw the
books of the excommunication of her Majesty by Pius Quintus and diverse others
tending to that purpose written since, and withal had well considered what the
Jesuits dealing had been: how that they had procured these indulgences and
pardons to serve their own turn therewith: I then well perceived upon what
grounds the said six articles were built. And Master Bales a blessed martyr
shall witness with me at the latter day, how woe my heart was, upon the last
speech he and I had together (in the house of an honorable person where we met)
about those and other matters: my last words being these unto him, scil. that
his holiness was misinformed, and indirectly drawn to these courses by
Jesuitical means. And therefore of all other orders of religion (were I to
go into any) I would never be Jesuit whiles I lived. And this may suffice for
the matter in question to convince any catholics true meaning heart, that the
circumstances well considered (with all humble obedience to the Sea apostolic
be it spoken) there neither was due circumstances in the Bull of Pius Quintus
to bind any to withdraw their allegiance from our Sovereign, neither (and
much less) was it convenient, that the same excommunication should have been
renewed again.

THE IX. ARTICLE.
Whether then seeing her Majesty and the state knew such practices were by
priests and other catholics used and put in execution, and yet were ignorant
who were of that faction more one then an other, till now of late that God has
most strangely, and in very deed (as it may he termed) miraculously revealed
the truth, which long has been hidden, to discern who are innocent and who
free: may not then her laws and proceedings against all catholics in general
from the beginning of her Highness reign to this present discovery of the
treasons and traitors that urged it, be truly counted both mild and
merciful. And that howsoever of her own accustomed innate royal disposition,
benignity, clemency, her Highness may (and we should wrong our own
conceits in prejudice of her sweet and Princely nature, if we should not
think she would) now at length take pity of such her own catholic
subjects, as have manifested their loyalty, innocence and ignorance, of what
was intended against her royal person and state. Yet whether in tendering the
afflictions which the innocent both secular priests and lay persons have
sustained, by making such laws or prouisoes, and adding them to the laws
already made, as may free both the priests and those that receive them from
the pains and penalties before by statute enacted against them all in
general: may not for all that, the said former statutes, penal laws, and
acts enacted, be thought to stand in force against the Jesuitical faction?
and no reason or sense to have them repealed, but both to have been made with
great moderation, and also to stand and remain with as great policy in all
or any wisemans judgment, that shall duly consider the Jesuits practices, and
other her Highness enemies against her person, state, and kingdom, in the
course precedent of all this time.

THE ANSWER.
I Hold directly the affirmative part herein, scil. that both her Majesty's
laws and proceedings against all sorts of catholics, have been mild and
merciful (the opinion and judgment of her Highness in religion one way, and
their foresaid practices against her another way duly considered) and also that
all the appellants and other priests and catholics that join with them in
prosecuting that appeal, as there is just cause and many reasons (which we
doubt not of, but that to her high prudence and Princely wisdom they will
present themselves in laments, submissions, and tears on our behalfes, and in
policy, mercy, and justice, on the part of her Highness toward us) why some
prouisoes should be made for securing of them the said appellants, and their
associates, together with those that do, or shall receive them hereafter, from
danger of the foresaid penal laws: so have they and we all that be catholics
in England this day, as great motives, causes, and reasons moving us to
admire: that ever any of us are left on live to make known to all posterity
what has happened in our days, the like woonders having never hitherto as yet
been seen, as our wretched age has left recorded to those shall follow us by
succeeding turns of natures course to the worlds end. And by consequent, we
cannot urge an absolute repeal of any former statute, or penal law, so long
as any Jesuit or other priest, or lay person of their faction (which I hope
would be very few, if any were after they were gone) shall remain within the
land: but think our selves happy and deeply bound to her Majesty, if a
prouisoe only may be made in form aforesaid, to keep the innocent harmeles,
though with an other prouisoe also or stricter statute (if stricter may be) for
the utter expelling of all Jesuits out of the land. And for to make this my
opinion sink the deeper into all catholics heads and hearts, that either are
infected with the Spanish pip, or otherwise Iesuited in affection or faction, I
must and do crave pardon for enlarging my self a little in handling this
subject to the purpose, and agreeing to their capacity.

Often have many wise, learned, and prudent, greatly mused what should have
been the cause (in moral sense to speak to men) of the heavy and sore
affliction of catholics in England for many years, yea it has been thought
of many great clerks (yet with pardon craved ignorant of our English cases, as
hereafter will appear) that the circumstances considered, as the occurrents
came to their minds, that their persecution in the primitive church was not
greater (if so great) respecting the danger of soule-wracke, then the
persecution in England has been for these twenty years space and upward, to
wit, since the unfortunate arrival of the Jesuits in this land.

The causes moving many to admire thereat, and in multitudes of vollees in
morneful sighs and sorrows, hurled out with wailings one to another greeuing
(when wise, devout, and true compassionates of their countries miseries met
together) that for our own and our forefathers sins, so heavy a scourge
should be laid upon our nation, our dear countrymen, our flesh and blood, our
nearest linckt unto us, often times our greatest lothers. Amongst others these
were the causes of their wonder, how it should be. First, they considered with
how great a sympathy all concord, natural incline and reciprocal affection,
It is no marvel though the Jesuits be so egar of England as they are, and that
they hazard body, soul and all they have or can be able to make to have it
wholly theirs. For considering the poor lodgings, scarcity of victuals, and
uncomfortable travel in other countries, as in Spain, constrained to carry
their meat with them, otherwise to fast for three or four days space. In
Scotland but poor lodging (God wot) and little better then Spain affoordeth:
In France and Flaunders not that civil order for bed or board as England
yields, and in all other nations compare their diet, their lodging, their
intertaine with the English, and certainly you shall find a stately
difference, no where to be in all this realm, unless upon the wastes or
borders and scant there) but you shall have lodging and intertaine sit for any
noble or state, within ten miles of that place where ever it be you are in* yea
the common Innes on London way through Watlingstreete, or the four forced
ways on every side, east, west, north and south, being sit and furnished to
give better intertaine to any prince in Christendom, then most nobles are in
other nations. Therefore respecting worldly pomp and pleasure, happy were the
Jesuits faction (but unhappy all others besides) if they might once bring this
flourishing English kingdom to be a defamed Spanish province.
had ever been noted in former ages betwixt the sovereigns and subjects of
this land. And that howsoever some princes had tyrannized over some few
stumbling blocks that stood in their way, as impediments to their quiet reign
(at least in their conceit) and other private persons had proved traitors and
rebels: yet in general you shall not find that ever the subjects of England
sought the death of their kings: or that the kings did tyrannize over the
multitude, but the battle once ended, were they civil broils as the Barons
wars, and the contention for the crown betwixt the two houses of York and
Lancaster etc. or foreign hostility, as those betwixt the Empress and king
Stephen, and betwixt king John of England, and prince Jews of France and
others. Now then, seeing never any sovereign regnant in this land was ever
holden to be of a more princely, magnificall, merciful, flexible, sweet,
loving, compassionate, and tender inclination, then her Majesty is of, to take
pity and pardon, to receive into grace and favor, and to win the hearts of
subjects by lenity and gentle means: And again for as much as never was the
multitudes and subjects in general of this land (I speak it of catholics, to
mine own knowledge of many loyal hearts as well as of the rest) more
serviceable, loyal, faithful, and affectionate, nor more willing to die at
their princes feet, or in their Sovereigns just quarrel, and cause any
where, then they have been hitherto under her Majesty, and are still to this
present: That all this notwithstanding so sore an affliction, so long
imprisonments, so continual searchings, so many sessions, assizes,
arraignments, losses of lands, goods, lives, and all should be by laws penal
made against catholic Recusants, many are moved on both sides, scil. as well
on the behalf of her Majesty's mercy, as of her truest subjects loyalty to
wonder at it.

Secondly, they had read the last will and testament of king William the
Conqueror, and what his first passage of speech was in his last passage of life
to king Henry the first, and duke Robert Curthoys his sons: to wit, that the
English natures were noble, generous, and gentle in themselves, fierce, hot,
and valiant in the field, loving, loyal, serviceable, and faithful to their
prince: Always provided, that their Sovereigns used them as children not as
slaves, for free borne denizens they are, and with enjoying their Franchises
and liberties, they will perform more then the most on their prince and
countries behalf, whereas the Normane (said he again) being a proud
stubborn, but yet a servile las^e people, not carrying those generous minds
which the English carry in all their actions must be curbed, holden in, and
still kept short: otherwise they will do nothing, nor regard either their
prince his honor, or their countries weal. The council of this prudent prince
caused a like respect in government to be had of these two nations, agreeing to
their natural dispositions of all the succeeding kings and Queens that ever
hitherto have reigned in this land: no nation under heaven bearing the port
and countenance in general which the English carry. The retinew of our English
nobles is comparable in pomp and show of honor. with princes courts in
foreign countries: our gentles are their nobles equals, in service and
offices belonging to noble bloods, and generous hearts. Yea many knights and
esquires in England, are able to dispend more then sundry Lords, Barons,
Vicounts, and Earls in other countries. And our Frankelings, Gentlemen
vntriall, or substantial Yeomen may be compared with the greatest Gentles in
other nations, as their fellows for intertainment: either respecting the
multitude of servants, service and attendance given to guests at their table,
or in their chamber, or the great good cheer with variety of dishes, and
those well and clenly dressed and served in, with great and many civil
ceremonies, or conueniences either of lodgings within, or walks without their
houses, or other commodities attendant on pomp and port, that either may yield
content, delight, or recreation to their friends: yea in sundry farmers houses
in England you shall find better intertainment then the most part of ordinary
Nobles in most kingdoms of the world is able to afford. This then being so,
their liberties and immunities being so many, their loyalty so firm, their
service so faithful: their education and bringing up so free, their
inheritance, freehold, demeasnes and rents so great and extraordinary duly
considered: And as well the high wisdom of her Majesty on the one side, as
the free education of her subjects on the other side well weighed; especially
in that an English nature even in the meanest member of the body political (
scil. in the communalty) is in this respect noble, free, of high courage, and
not able to endure lingering deaths, torments, gusts and greefes as other
people are: that notwithstanding her loyal subjects, as well noble as ignoble
should be put to those exigents that catholics have a long time bin put unto,
the world has mused and admired at it.

Thirdly, they looked back sometime into the ages, acts, and reigns of Nero,
of Dioclesian, of Commodus, of Probus, of Heliogabal, of Maximilian the Emperor
and others: and read the histories and apologies of Damascen, of Iustine, of
Athenagoras, of Tertullian, of Epiphanius, of Eusebius and others: wherein they
found sundry reasons and motives as they thought not a little to move these
heathen Emperors to lenity and mercy: which books and apologies often took
effect as written to that end, but not as father Parsons Philopater. or father
Creswels Scribe, or father Southwels Epistle to her Majesty are written:
always in accusing or reproouing some one, or many, or all her highness nobles
and civil magistrates: a very indiscreete part in them how true soever the
reports had been; our frownd on state considered, and that we were to seek
the favor of all, not to exasperate any especially so near her Majesty as
those were etc. But amongst many worthy examples and reasons alleged by these
ancient fathers to the heathen emperors in the primitive Church, why they
should grant liberty of conscience to Christians: arguments deduced from
policy, civility, humanity, and their own princely benignity (for they not
accustomed with matters of faith, religion and conscience being infidels, only
moral, civil, political, and humane respects, such as some sparks of
Synderesis, and the laws of reason, of nature and nations are in man) were
motives to moon them to surcease from persecution, or else nothing. Of all the
rest Athenagoras in his Apology to the emperor Commodus on the behalf of the
Christians frames his speech to the best construction and fitliest agreeing to
the matter now in question, to the judgment of many on the English catholics
behalf to our Sovereign. For the sum of Athenagoras speech consisting (as
it does) in this: that one and a chief reason why the emperor should grant
free use and liberty of conscience to the Christians, was for that, his
Majesty together with all his predecessors, freely granted the same freedom
to all other sects, sectaries, professors of religion, and worshippers of
sundry gods and goddesses, as far different in the worship done to, and
derogating from the Majesty and honor of Caesar, as the God of the Christians,
or worship done unto him did or could any way differ or derogate. And seeing
that every particular province, country and people had their peculiar gods to
themselves, whom they worshipped with a kind of singularity used in one thing
or other toward them, that others wanted, where ever they went or lived
either in the province of their birth, or else transported to some region
further of, or nearer hand, and yet never once examined nor asked the question
why they did so: then ab inductione, Athenagoras did conclude even iure
gentium, that the Christians throughout the emperors dominions, ought to have
the like liberty, tolleration and conniuence granted them. Whereupon our
catholics in England bringing in an argument a simili, that if there were
reason why the Emperor should permit the Christian religion as well as other
religions opposite to the Roman rites in gentilisme, that were then allowed
of, with all their pluralities: of like sort then say ours; seeing her Majesty
permits Puritanes, Brownists (or Barowists) Familians, etc. to live quiet
within her dominions; it were agreeing as well to mercy suited always best
with majesty, as also to, if not our just, yet our lawful desires, for to
have the like liberty, or at least not to be haunted with continual
searchings, hazard of life, ordinary taxations and losses of lands and goods
taken from them, as the catholic recusants are and have been long in these
vexations, troubles and dangers, from whence all other are free. Amidst this
argument they urge further: for that the emperors in those days were heathen,
our Sovereign a Christian; theirs often strangers to the Romans, yea always
strangers to one nation or other, over which they governed, especially during
the reigns of some thirty emperors, even until Constantine the great his time
(by reason that the imperial crown of Caesar went by mere election that
while, whereupon followed so many bloody murders, massacrings, and open
wars against one another, for aspiring to the imperial sovereignty. Here
one proclaimed emperor in the field by a rabble of unruly soldiers; there
another denounced, installed and crowned emperor by the Senate, and he
sometimes an Italian, otherwhile a Spaniard, otherwhile a Frenchman, then a
Britane borne in this land, and after that perhaps a Grecian etc:) Whereas now
our Lady and Sovereign, is of our own nation, birth, blood, education,
natural incline, and all things to move to lenity. Again their pluralities
of gods and diversities of worships, sacrifices, and ceremonies tended only to
points of religion, sects and opinions amongst themselves, no way otherwise
derogating to the imperial crown of Caesar: But these in England (which yet
as I said are permissible) differ not only, all of them in general, from the
present church of England, yea, and one from another in matters of faith, and
points of religion besides, as much as the catholics do differ from the
Protestants, if not more; but even also in matters of state in the highest
degree: the Puritans as eagerly seeking and wishing the death of her Majesty,
and both writing and speaking as boldly unto her as any traitor ever did or
durst speak to his prince, and yet they are permitted to live and enjoy their
liberty, whereas the catholics can not be any way endured: which to nations
abroad gives no little cause of admiration.

Fourthly, they otherwhiles turned over their books, wherein they had registered
the imperial decrees of Caesar, and finding amongst other points of importance
belonging to this great cause of our heaviness and wonder, how that ever so
sore an affliction of catholics should have fallen out in our unfortunate age,
and that in our native country, and amongst our own dearest and nearest
friends, by all conjunctions of laws, orders and motives, they had there
quoted how that in time of Arrianisme and other afflictions and persecutions of
the church under Julian, under Valens, under Constans, under Constantius, under
Theodoret and others the like: when the same emperors were fautors, yea and
earnest persecutuors, protectors and patrons of the catholics adversaries, and
that all the Christian world was infected with those heresies, which continued
400. years ere they were quite extinct: yet were these great Monarchs and
mighties of the world so far from inflicting such a general affliction upon
all catholics in those days, as now the English catholics do sustain; that
they thought it enough to have them, and that but in some places, for to be
deprived of their Benefices, Bishoprics, and other as well ecclesiastical as
temporal dignities and offices, suffragating Arrian Bishops and others in
their places, without further taxes laid upon them, or other troubles and
vexations in general. For what was done in special against Saint Siluester,
and Saint Siluerius martyr; against Saint Basil and Saint Martin martyr;
against Saint John and Saint Donatus both martyrs: against Saint Athanasius,
Saint Chrysostom and others, it was of private grudge and no general cause.
Nay, which was more, even those same emperors that persecuted the catholics
most; yet often of their own princely benignity and mere motion, proceeding
of their innate clemency; they would and did authorize, grant, and make offer
from their imperial throne to sundry catholic Bishops and other prelates,
even under their hands. (For as I said before in places, provinces and
countries further of, though subject to the Roman empire, there was no
question made of having catholics or Arrian Bishops equally and alike, as the
number of the one or other religions did sway most) that they might use their
Episcopal jurisdictions and other rites and ceremonies agreeing to the custom
of the catholic church etc. And at Millane, at Antioch, at Constantinople and
elsewhere, were sometimes offers, and often graunts made to catholics to have
their churches and chapels to themselves apart from the Arrians and other
infest enemies of the catholics, suffering them (the said clergy on both
sides) to do it by dispitions amongst themselves, never persecuting any
catholic for that cause, unless some special grudge or occasion of high
displeasure taken by the emperors against some particular person (which for the
most part proceeded on the Arrians behalf and suggestion made by them) had
moved them to the contrary. Which being so, and that the princely disposition
and royal heart of our Sovereign is behind none of the woorthiest emperors
that ever sat enthronized with imperial crown, for a flexible, mild free
nature, and sweet incline to mercy, bounty, pity, grace, pardon, favor and
compassion taken of her subjects (be as they be may) in different affections of
religion aliened from her, together with her magnificencie, liberality and
majesty equalling, (if not before them) either great Alexander or Julius the
worthy Caesar. Of which two, although it were said of the former in Greece,
and of the latter in Rome: that Alexander the Conqueror in using liberality,
and Julius Caesar in pardoning of injuries, none ever equald or at least went
before them: yet was it spoken (and so it is understood) of precedent ages, not
of future heroeces: we no way yielding in our heauiest thoughts, of heart
burning griefs sustained, to hear our noble Elizabeth, prince peregall,
paramount and paragon, the so admired at Saba of Europes England, as all the
world has woondred, at her more then ordinary indowments of princely nature:
otherwise accounted of, then as a Sance-pere: giving place to none of former
present or future times, persons or ages, for and in all points attending at
the gates of royal honor or throne of regal Majesty. That then
notwithstanding all this: her Highness worn out subjects, suppliants, poor
afflicted catholics in her prisons, in durance, dangers, and distress every
where, should have so hard a hap, as not only to be deprived of all
ecclesiastical and temporal dignities, offices, preferments any manner of
way, which yet were more tolerable, as a thing they nothing less expect, wish
for, or desire; it being so, that both clergy and laity of the catholics
take it as a sweet chasticement and fatherly scourge sent them from God, to be
humbled with so heavy a downfall; but also (which does grieve them most) to
live in sorrow, heaviness, and suspicion had of their unattained loyalties in
general, for some private offenses in special: that they of al other should
feel the force of these unaccustomed frowns: which pearce those hearts the
deepest, whose faithful services have been dearest to their Sovereigns, in
their own and their forefathers days: That not one noble will speak for
them: that no solace should be left them: no comfort ever affoorded them: no
hope at all this long time given them, of ever receiving a glympse or glance of
those accustomed gracious smyles, which ordinarily do flow in pearld streams,
from lions heart, of truest gold gushing out at silver lymbecks, of egles eyes
all royal in their rarenes: That this should be all catholics heavy case:
her highness a prince, and second to none in majesty, mercy, and magnificencie:
her catholic subjects seconded with as few for service, submission and
loyalty: and yet that they should be put from time to time to such sore
trials, and endure so many calamities, is a suitable cause with the rest of
admiration and wonder.

Fifthly, they sometimes cast their eyes aside to Turks, to Persians, to all
Pagan provinces, to see if they can epsy any one sect, profession, or
professors of religion, tossed, turmoilde, and tormented as the English are,
and throughout all this vaste Macrocosme, they find not one pattern, sampler,
nor example left to posterity to be recorded like to ours. The Sophy indeed
has a long time had great and mortal wars with the Ottomane race, family, and
successors in the Turkish tribe; so has great Mogor, great Came of Catay,
Presbyter John, and other monarchs adjoining and affronting him: but yet
omitting the general contention amongst the Mahumetans about the heirs of
Ella, and the body of Mahomet: there is a liberty granted for religion to all
men, in a sort more tolerable then in England is to be heard of for catholics
to enjoy. The very Turk (who has the straitest laws) forbids indeed all
talk, disputation, or controversy to be about religion: but yet he permits
either Christians or any other to live quiet under him, using their own rites,
service, and ceremonies, for paying a certain yearly tribute: which is not
much more then catholics pay in England, even to their natural Prince and
Sovereign, and yet cannot have the like security, safety, and quiet, from
inferior officers: but still in one place or other within her Majesty's
dominions they are pild and pold to the uttermost: So as when all is quiet at
London, then are they aloft in Yorkshire, and throughout the North: when quiet
there, then up in Wales, and the marches that way. And thus persecution running
per circulum, the land never wholly at rest and quiet: these things many
learned men and others have woondred at, not knowing what were the causes.

Sixthly, sometimes those grave and reverend prelates cast back their eyes to
these our latter ages and present times wherein now we live, and to the
bordering kingdoms and princes round about us, to see whether any like to
these our English miseries and catholic distresses can be found. And in
Germany howsoever there be some slacknes and dislikes at their Diets and
election of their Caesar: yet in civil conversation one with another, and for
life, government and order, the emperor though a catholic finds as great
service and concord amongst his subjects, and they again use and enjoy all
their immunities, freedoms and liberties with as great content and quiet
living in one Province, in one city, in one town, in one street, yea and in
one house sometimes together of diffrent, as if they were all of one mind,
faith, and religion. In France we see what liberty of conscience wrought. Did
it not as well animate the Hugonites to join with king Henry of the house of
Valois then a catholic in show, howsoever the Jesuits censure of his heart, as
it did of like sort the catholics to join with the now most Christian and
catholic king Henry the 4. then a Protestant? yea, and did they not stick as
sure and fast to his christian Majesty, as if he had been of their own
catholic religion and profession, and that with as great alacrity of mind,
in regard of his present right to that crown, and their future hopes of his
conversion to their church and faith, as afterward it happened God sweetly so
disposing: that he who could not by rough handling be made flexible by
experience of his subjects loyalty, is of a lion become a lamb. In few, we see
in Polony, in Sweden, in Scotland, in Flaunders and every where, that
catholics are together with those of other professions, sects, and opinions,
unless it be where only the Consistorian Caluinian, Cartwrightian puritans
rule the roast, and that a company of ministers, or exorbitant superintendants
ouertop both Prince, prelate, and all, as in Scotland and at Geneua, etc.
Otherwise all kings and princes of this age have judged it in policy the
fittest, wisest, safest, and most honorable and princely course they could have
taken: to grant liberty of conscience to their subjects. Which seeing our
sovereign Queen Elizabeth has not granted, and yet is known to be in her
own high towering princely wisdom of as high a pitch, sound and deep
conceit, censure, and judgment: in reach not to be seconded of any of these:
adding heereunto, that for government of her land, for policy in her state,
for noblenes in her court, her Highness has the choice of as fine, delicate and
dainty breed of gallant, grave, quick wits as Europe, nay as Afrike, nay as
Asia, nay as the world this day enioyes. The Italian, the Spaniard, the
Polonian, the Sweden, the Moscouite, the Turk, the Persian, and who not is
willing to advance her Majesty's meanest sort of subjects, sometime to the
highest types of honor, to win them wholly to be theirs, to learn wit,
slight, and policy out of their practice and experience. These Boreas
blasted lads, borne under the Britain Ocean, able to fire with their wits the
hot climatical Southern Sages: witness our Stukeleyes, our Candishes, our
Furbishers, our Drakes, our Hills, our Sherleys, our Parsons, etc. All these
circumstances duly weighed: that this heavy yoke should be laid by so
merciful, wise, and prudent a prince, upon the weak necks of her poor
subjects with weight importable for them to carry, unless her highness should
stretch forth her accustomed Atlantike arms of clemency, to support them
before they sink down right under their burden. That this severity should
be more used against catholics in England, then either any catholic king or
prince of other professions, either Christian or heathen use against either
subjects or forrainers of contrary religions unto the said princes throughout
the world this day: This is the point which many stand upon in admiring how
ever things should have come to that pass they are at in England concerning
the affliction of catholics, and cannot find out the causes.

This then to make manifest to all the world by an historical discourse, and
that howsoever we have matter enough against our adversaries even for religions
sake, yet neither to aggrauate more then is necessary, nor to accuse further
then is expedient: nor to excuse more then is convenient: nor yet to lay the
fault of any that is faultlesse: therefore shall it be made known, that as the
affliction of catholics in England has been in very deed extraordinary as is
here set down, and many an innocent man lost his life: so also has the cause
thereof been extraordinary; and so far beyond the accustomed occasions of
persecution given to any prince in christendom, or monarchy, that is, or ever
was in the world to this hour (unless the Puritanes of Scotland, which may in
some sort equal the offense here to be set down) as rather it is to be
woondred at (all things duly considered) that any one catholic is left on live
in England, then that our persecution has been so great: for name one nation
(I know none can) under heaven, where the subjects (especially if they were
catholics) ever sought the death of their Sovereign (though of a different
religion from them) the conquest of their native land, the subversion of the
state, the depopulation of the weal public, the alteration and change of al
laws, customs, and orders, and in few the utter deuastation, desolation, and
destruction of all the ancient inhabitants of their land, in so unnatural,
unchristian, vncatholike a manner, as the Spanish faction have sought it in our
own flesh and blood against this realm: which treacherous courses, although
they were but some few and those private persons offenses: and by consequent
in a court of conscience, and in rigor of justice, the rest neither acting,
nor concurring, nor consenting to their conspiracies; were innocent and no way
to be used with that severity as many catholics have been. Yet forasmuch as
the pretenses of such practices were general and common to all catholics
alike: all maintaining one and the same opinion concerning what might be done
by apostolical power and authority, and never talking of what was necessary:
therefore was it that her Majesty and the state standing on the other side
affected in religion as they did: had both cause to judge secundum allegata and
probata in foro externo, and also can not otherwise be thought of, but that the
circumstances on all sides considered, as well making for her own security,
as also for a Non-knowledge, what catholics were guilty, and who were free;
her Majesty's laws and proceedings against catholics have been both mild
and merciful. And as we are to think (in deed) our hap now to be hard if no
mitigation nor prouisoe should be made for the innocent (now that the way and
means is known for discovery of traitors, and distinguishing betwixt state
catholics and catholic loyal subjects: so also are we to give her Highness
humble thanks for our lives, that we were not al cut off, whiles no difference
was made, put, nor known betwixt the secular priests and Jesuits: and that we
have been permitted to live to this happy hour, of manifesting our catholic
co^stancy and obedience to the Sea apostolic in all our actions, and our
natural loyalty and serviceable hearts to our Prince and country in all our
proceedings, in neither stayning our catholic religion with unnatural
treason, nor priestly function with factious dispositions and state affairs.
But of this matter I will here be silent: referring you to a treatise lately
set out by my brethren, entitled Important considerations, etc. whereunto I
have prefixed an Epistle. By both which you may see at large what statizing by
acts, words, and writings in most treacherous and treasonable manner has
been against her Majesty, against the present state, against the whole
commonwealth, against us all without exception her Highness loyal and natural
subjects, of what religion soever we be, which seeing her Princely heart, has
forborne as no Sovereign on earth would ever have suffered the like to have
past unpunished as she has, I must conclude and end as we began, that her
laws and proceedings have been both mild and merciful.

THE X. ARTICLE.
Whether then (the premises considered) is it fit that Catholics should send
their children and friends to be brought up in the Seminaries beyond the seas
or not? If not, then how should the salt of the earth be kept uncorrupted or
the seed of priesthood be continued for restoring of the catholic Roman
faith in England: And if so that they be sent, then how should her Majesty and
the state here be satisfied or moved to mitigate the former several laws made
against them and all catholics for their Jesuitical crimes.

THE ANSWER.
THis Interrogatorie is indeed a very doubtful Dilemma in a sequel to great
sense: respecting what has been said in the last article. For kings have ever
been jealous of their estates: have and do orderly take any occasion to
prevent the worst: and none has ever had greater cause then her Majesty has
had to suspect her catholic subjects loialtie in general, for some private
and peculier Jesuitical treasons, wrought against her royal person and state
in special: they still practicing and we still punished: they only faulty,
and we commonly smarting for their offenses: they still attempting, and the
catholics cause daily more and more indaungered and hindered by them* And
again the jealousy had of us all is greatly increased, by these three heads
viz. One in that it is apparent that the Seminaries in Spain were intended by
father Parsons of purpose to cause a conquest and to bring this land into
bondage and slavery of the Spaniard: An other in that he being Rector of the
Seminary at Rome, all that come there must dance after his pipe or else woe be
to them etc. The third, for that all school Divinity being banished out of the
Seminary at Doway (because says Parsons Scientia inflat) his subject Doctor
Woorthington must teach them to practice what he will have them in England else
get they no faculties. Which things occasionating a marvelous great suspicion
to be had of all catholics by the state, and thereby withal increasing our
manifold dangers on every side: it makes the case very doubtful what to think
of continuance of the Seminaries being all now under these blody cruel hearted
traitorous and most unnatural, irreligious and consciencelesse Jesuits
tirannicall government. Therefore to the article thus I answer.

First, that I am not of their opinion who hold that the said English
Seminaries at Rome and Rhemes were ordained of purpose to train up seditious
youths (as our adversaries say) and after some time to send them into England
to move rebellion. Secondly, I am fully persuaded that his holiness Pope
Gregory the thirteenth and some others had very sincere hearts in the erecting
of them, and were far from any intent to have the Seminary priests of England
brought up there in any treacherous or traitorous manner, but in a most holy,
religious and virtuous course of life, study, and exercise: as Cardinal Allane
in his apollogie does demonstrate. Thirdly, no man shall be able to write that
commendation of their doings therein, whereunto I will not most willingly
subscribe, and auowe whiles breath is in my body, or life does last in me. Yet
all this notwithstanding as the case is now with the said Seminaries, I am of
opinion (setting aside the said holy intent and godly institution) that no
catholics ought to send their children or friends thither. First, because they
are greatly degenerated (though the time be not long since they were erected)
from their primitive foundation and intent of the founders. Secondly, they were
ordained for the training up of the best wits to be secular priests: but now
they are abused to the increasing of the number of the Jesuits. Thirdly, true
cases of conscience, school divinity, positive exercises for matters of
controversy in religion, and other studies of humanity besides were there
taught: but now their heads must be filled with treacheries, equivocations,
dissimulation, hypocrisy and all kind of falsehood: otherwise they are not fit
disciples of Jesuitical traitors nor fit for to be of the Spaniards faction.
Fourthly, the Jesuits have gotten into their hands the government of the same
Seminaries: who being very odious men to diverse states will bring likewise a
detestation of all such priests as shall be brought up underneath them. Fifthly,
we find by experience that the Jesuits here in England do therefore challenge
superiority and precedence of the secular priests, because whilst they were
in the Seminaries they were brought up and trained by them: which tends to
the great derogation of the secular priesthood. Sixthly, although her Majesty
and the state hitherto have not dealt so roughly either with priests or other
catholics as they might have done: yet knowing now that our english students
being brought up by Parsons direction chiefly, and that in their missions
hither his manner is to bind them to set out the said Infantaes title as is
before expressed: it cannot choose but that the state will proceed against them
as they shall be taken with greater severity. Seventhly, whereas heretofore it
was made only subject to a pecuniary mulet for any catholic to send their
sons or friends beyond the seas: if hereafter a law be made to inflict the
same punishment upon such as send youths thither: who can justly take
exception to it? And the rather can they not take exception to such a law:
because of the punishment that is already ordained for those that shall receive
priests from thence. Now for the last point in the article: my opinion is and I
verily think that all catholic English subjects, priests or lay persons (that
are not to too much bewitched with Iesuitisme) are of my mind: that all
faithful catholics (the premises considered) are bound in conscience to
become most humble suitors to his holiness for the remoouing of all Jesuits not
only out of England (where they have already wrought all our woes) but even
also from intermedling in any sort with the said Seminaries in any place beyond
the seas. Or if they cannot be heard through the Machiuilian practices of the
Jesuits (as questionles what the malice of the devil, or wit of his foul
instrument Parsons can invent shall be urged to the uttermost to stop this
course): then they are to fall to their prayers that God himself will thrust
out laborers into this vineyard: and draw the hearts of the students in our own
universities here in England: to receive and embrace the catholic faith, if
not in general (which we heartily wish and pray for) yet in some certain
colleges either in the one or the other: And withal for the better hope
thereof to commence our humble suit unto her Majesty, joining thereunto our
hearty prayers, that God of his mercy would vouchsafe to incline her princely
heart to grant us some college or other house fit for that purpose, with free
leave to teach and read such lectures as may be fitting for our profession,
and for to withdraw and take away all occasions or necessities of sending any
of our friends beyond the seas. In which most pious, politic and honorable
act (fitly agreeing to her Majesty, and magnificencie, and granted even of
heathen princes to christian priests and prelates) her Highness should not only
merit lasting fame, renown; and memory to all posterity, but even also
thereby cut off occasions of infection with Jesuitical conspiracies ever
hereafter: when as such seditious rotten weeds should be rooted out, which
both endanger her royal person and present state, and bring us all her
faithful subjects to be suspected by their means. And as for study, learning,
and other catholic exercises, let this good motive (dear catholics) be no
way heavily taken, nor rashly censured: as though there were no learning nor
method of teaching, nor any government or virtuous exercise, but where a
Jesuit bears the stroke. For know you this, that as there are their betters
in England and out of it that are no Jesuits, even of our own nation this day
in all things required in teachers, masters, and governors: so before ever any
Jesuits came or were in rerum natura, the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge
flourished amongst the most famous schools in Christendom: either for school
method or positive doctrine in Divinity, Philosophy, or any other study. And
seeing it cannot be denied but that for all the Jesuits boast of their
learning, government, method of teaching, and I can not tell what: yet still
have the seculars and Seminary priests been the chief Readers and
profoundest Clarks either in Divinity or philosophy, that have gone out of our
Nation in these days: witness our Allans, our Stapletons, our Giffords, our
Hardings, our Parkinsons, our Elyes, our Kellingsons, with sundry other
Doctors and schoolmen (to omit, those that are in England at this present,
together with diverse religious Englishmen of S. Benedicts, of S. Dominicks, of
S. Fraunces, and of other religious orders:) al of them to be preferred before
our new illuminates these vainglorious vanting men. Besides we see that for all
our Seminaries under the Jesuits, yet the most famous men from time to time
have been brought up under the secular clergy, or the Dominican preachrers
and teachers in all nations. Also it is well known, that there is nothing
wanting in our Universities here in England for making profound clarks and
learned men in deed: save only that sound catholic doctrine and school
method which was used in Gabrell Beoll, in Alexander of Hales, and in John
Scots days. For otherwise never was there a finer breed of wits, nor brauer
Orators, nor more pleasant Poets, nor perfecter Grammarians, nor more copious
Linguists, nor riper men in all studies of humanity, then are brought up in
our English Universities. Therefore seeing that which is wanting might be
supplied by catholic doctors and teachers of our own nation (any Jesuits
equals) and that we see sundry of the finest wits resort to our side daily,
notwithstanding all these either contentions betwixt us and the Jesuits, or yet
the present affliction and danger we all do live in of our common adversaries:
then think (dear catholics) as true it is, that there can no question be made
of it to the contrary, but that where one comes now unto us, there would then
come ten of all sorts, by such careful diligence and choice of tutors as upon
this so gracious a grant (O happy who may live to see it) of her Majesty,
might be used both in Oxford and Cambridge; as that you might have your
children there inclined and trained up with some such good conceits of the
catholic faith and religion, as nourished and cherished therein by you that
are their friends in natural love and affection, and confirmed by us that are
priests, as in christian charity and catholic duty we are bound: there would
quickly follow a joyful forgetfulness of the Jesuits exile, as the perturbers
of both the catholic church and Englands commonwealth, and ruin of us all if
they remain amongst us.

And thus having brought this long, tedious, intricate, and most dangerous,
difficult, and doubtful Quodlibet of plots, by statizing to an end in some
sort, though not half so much said herein, as both the weight of the matter
it self does require, and also as willing I was and am to have written
thereof, as well in respect of justice as of charity (both moving me to
speak:) were I not infringed upon other considerations justly compelling me to
silence. Therefore unwilling to hold you any longer in this so discomfortable
a party, as necessarily the talk of these matters must needs be to many devout
souls, which no doubt will be assaulted with variable cogitations in the
peruse of this discourse, woe be to them who have occasioned such strait
passages of our heaviness: I now end in hearty prayer upon my knees, that God may
turn all to his glory, as well for religion as state: and so proceed to other
matters in hand.

THE ARGUMENT OF THE NINTH GENERAL QVODLIBET.
Having said more in the last Quodlibet then I shall have thanks for at the
Jesuits hands, but that I am John Indifferent and a Wilful Will, that will
never force a friend nor fear a foe in an act of public justice: as I hold it
for such that a greater act both of justice and of chatity could not be, then
(if my poor co^ceits by pen expressed can do it) to defend Gods cause and
quarrel, my prince and countries right, the gaulelesse catholics innocent
hearts: and to firret these cony-catching Jesuits out of conceit from all
English berries or warrens, that carry either oil of perfect charity in
their lamps, or fire of true catholic zeal within their breasts, or
natural affection to their prince, their country, their parents, children,
flesh and blood, their dearest friends. Hereupon there does occur to my
memory two general Quodlibets which make as much for our purpose as any we
have hitherto handled, scil. to make known to the world the surmised form,
(but in deed very weak) foundation the Jesuits have laid, especially this
most Atheall Polypragmon father Parsons) to perfect the platform of statizing
mentioned in the last Quodlibet precedent, for the overthrow of all that are
not as they. And therefore shall the first of these two Quodlibets be of plots
by succession: the second of plots by presages. The former, then consisting of
such devises, engines and baits, as the Jesuits have cast abroad into every
mundane puddle^, pond and poole of Christendom: to fish for an absolute
monarchy; that as there is but one God and Savior Lord and king Jesus in
heaven, so but one sole regiment by Jesuits on earth: the articles concerning
that point are these 10. following.

THE NINTH GENERAL QVODLIBET OF PLOTS by succession.
THE I. ARTICLE.
WHether is the practice of the Jesuits agreeable to christian charity, and
the duty of true subjects, to interpret every thing that their Sovereign and
the state of the country does, in the woorst part, to slander, deprave, and
calumniate the king their Lord, and his proceedings, by libels and sundry sorts
of chartals, books, and pamphlets; of purpose both to make his highness, his
government, and his whole kingdom, as much as in them lies offensive to other
princes now, and odious hereafter to all posterity or not?

THE ANSWER.
THe Quodlibets of state and succession having such an affinity by sequel of
proper kind (as we now handle them) that the one follows the other as the
shadow does the body: there is nothing said in the last general Quodlibet of
state, but it has a relation to this of succession. So as it can not be
otherwise imagined, but that the Jesuits have a further drift and intend a
greater mischief, then all the world dreams of: to make princes, state,
government, and all authority, seem odious to the multitude. Therefore I
affirm and say absolutely as in my heart I think it: that their proceedings
therein, are neither religious, catholic, christian, nor dutiful, but very
barbarous, impious, and dishonest: which I prove first by testimony of holy
writ: Thou shall not speak evil of the prince of thy people, said the wise
Solomon amongst his many Proverbs. Secondly, Curse not the king: no not in thy
thought, said the great Preacher in his ecclesiastics: and to the same purpose
are the two great princes of the earth Saint Peter his words in his first
Epistle, and Saint Paul his speech by an Epistle to Titus. Thirdly again if
any action can bear two constructions: charity binds a man to take the best.
But princes have never had more cause then now they have by the Jesuits
practices, to be jealous of their estates, ergo it ought to be construed in the
best sense, a man may, if their government be contrary to our likings.
Fourthly, besides kings proceedings are often above the capacity of the subjects
and are not by them to be scanned or sifted: much less to be slaundered and
depraved. Fifthly, furthermore kings being the fathers of their country if they
should have in their proceedings any nakedness: their subjects show themselves
to be of the generation of Cham, that will not rather cover then detect them.
But such are the Jesuits unnatural hearts and greedy desire of sovereignty, as
it seems nothing does more delight them then to find in a prince, or priests
coat some thing to make them seem odious to their subjects or ghostly
children. Sixthly also the honor of our country ought to be more dear unto
us, then our own credites or estimation: nay oftentimes then our lives
themselves: ergo, how can it be chosen but that the Jesuits being so ambitious
in seeking their own glory, so greedy of their own praises and so deeply
affecting sovereign dominion, should not condemn themselves in their own
consciences in detracting and calumniating their sovereigns.

It is therefore most manifest and true as I have often said and must have
often cause to repeat the same: that of long time the grauest sort of the
secular priests in England have utterly disliked such pamphlets, and railing
treatises and books as have been set out to the dishonor of her Majesty and
state here. The book that Doctor Saunders writ De schismate, and his other De
visibili Monarchia, we wish with all our hearts that they had never seen light.
Diverse of father Parsons books letters, and treatises, we have and do from our
very hearts utterly condemn them: as containing many seditious and traiterous
points: and being very full of slanderous speeches and impudent calumniations.
Andreas Philopater being the fruits of father Parsons, and father Creswell, we
hold to be fraught till it almost burst again (as some of my brethren
elsewhere have noted) with all Jesuitical pride and poison. And as touching
the Exhortation before mentioned printed 1588. it is so detestable a treatise,
as all posterity cannot choose but condemn father Parsons for a most
scurrilous traitor. If he had been brought up amongst all the ruffians and
Curtizans in Christendom, he could not have learned to have writ more vilely,
profanely, and heathnishly. Furthermore, in that father Parsons and his fellow
father Creswell, do glory in their said book that they have caused not only
it, but also master Saunders treatise De schismate, to be translated into the
Spanish tongue, and do rejoice, that thereby the Spaniards are brought already
into a greater detestation of her Majesty, her government and proceedings then
they had before: I think they glory in their own shame, and that they are to
be accounted by all true catholics to be most vile and traiterous persons:
that they dishonor priesthood, and are as right Jesuits, as insolency and
hatred can make them. And so I conclude that the Jesuits practices and intents
in wresting their Sovereigns and the state affairs in every political,
moral, and humane action, to the worst sense: is neither agreeing to Christian
justice, catholic charity, nor bounden duty of true subjects: but like
rebellious traitors to bring all into uproar, that they may have al crowns,
kingdoms, governments, succession, state, inheritance, and all at their
pleasure.

THE II. ARTICLE.
Whether may not Jesuits: although they are religious men, and therefore
excluded from dealing in public secular affairs, yet for all that which has
been said, employ themselves in matters of state thus far: scil, to direct
and appoint the form of the civil government: to set down who ought to
succeed: to alter the ancient laws of their country: to decide and determine
difficulties that may rise concerning all and every competitors title, in way
of succession by birth, blood, etc. to the crown: and to innouate all things
under the pretense of gods glory and the promoting of their own society? Or
whether are not all these imputations, so many untruths and calumniations?

THE ANSWER.
I Hold it as I said before altogether unlawful for them to deal so in state
matters and by consequent indecent. First, for that it is against the rules of
their orders: and very presumptuous, for any of them to meddle with the
succession to the crown at all. Secondly, it does repugne from the very nature
of all religious profession, which is a seperating of men from the actions of
the world. Thirdly, it tends to that which we most condemn in our common
adversaries. For the consequence will be hardly denied: it is lawful for
clergy men to manage civil causes; ergo it is lawful for temporal men to
manage causes ecclesiastical. For wrest it and wring it as well and which way
soever we can possibly devise, yet will it always be judged of our adversaries
an assertion, most evident and absurd to be denied, that temporal men should
not have as great authority in church causes as Jesuits, monks, or friars at
least, if not also as other secular and ecclesiastical persons should have in
causes civil. Fourthly, I shall not much need to travel in this point,
because the Jesuits themselves do digest nothing worse then to hear
themselves charged with it: for it is a practice with them to do all things
under hand, and to be as little seen in them as possibly they can devise.
And therefore (as I have often told you no less) for the most part that which
they go about, they do it by other men or by feined names: that if any
inconvenience should happen, they might either lay the blame upon others, or
else deny it: so you shall see in time that although our worshipful Archpriest
has done nothing but by fahaer Garnets direction: yet when his ridiculous,
unjust, uncharitable, d^ttyrannous proceedings shall come to the scanning,
father Garnet will do the best he can to pull his neck out of the collar, and
master Blackwell shall be the Ass that must bear all the burden: So father
Parsons that holy man by his practice does give father Garnet a pregnant
example. In the most of those seditious books which he the said father Parsons
has published, he has either concealed his name, or given them such names as
it has pleased him to devise. And one of his said books being set out by him
under the name of master Dolman, now that many exceptions are taken unto it: he
(good man) was not the author of it: his name is not Dolman: and gladly he
would shift and wash his hands of it: but all the water betwixt this and Rome
will not serve his turn so to do: although by the common principle of the
Jesuits, he may by lying and equiuocating make a fair show. But of this enough
is said before.

As concerning the second point I will now make it plain unto you: that the
Jesuits being charged as in the former question is set down, are not therein
slaundered any way unjustly. For, First, it is plain that father Parsons and
his company (divide it amongst them how they list) have laid a plot as being
most consonant and fitting to their other designments, that the common laws of
the Realm of England must be (forsooth) either abolished utterly, or else
bear no greater sway in the Realm then now the civil law does. And the
chief reason is, for that the state of the crown and kingdom by the common
laws is so strongly settled, as whilst they continue, the Jesuits see not how
they can work their wills. And on the other side, in the civil laws they
think they have some shreds, whereby they may patch a cloak together, to
cover a bloodly show of their treasons for the present, from the eyes of the
vulgar sort. And certainly I could not choose but smile when I read this point
in father Parsons book, to see how prettily this fine fingred figgeboy
conueigheth his matter: how the common lawyers must wait upon the Ciuilians to
bear their books after them: and how they are to applaud to all that the
doctors will auerre to be law upon their bare words unto them. Secondly, the
said good father deeming of all men (it seems) by himself, has set down a
course how every man may shake off all authority at their pleasures, as if he
would become a new Anabaptist, or king John of Leyden, to draw all the world
into a mutiny, rebellion, or combustion. And this stratageme is how the common
people may be inueigled and seduced to conceit to themselves such a liberty
and prerogative, as that it may be lawful for them when they think meet, to
place and displace kings and princes, as men may do their tenants at will,
hirelings, or ordinary servants. Which Anabaptisticall and abominable
doctrine, proceeding from a turbulent tribe of traitorous Puritanes and other
heretics: this treacherous Jesuit would now foist into the catholic church,
as a ground of his corrupt divinity. And sure it is strange to consider how
the caitiffe handles this point, giving advantage thereby to all nations to
revolt from the Sea apostolic: if any catholic prince would take hold or
build upon this absurd fellows word or authority. For that amongst other
arguments he insisteth upon certain rebellious and most traitorous examples,
how some kings in this Island have been dealt with. As if a man should take
upon him to prove murder lawful, because many examples of murder may be
produced: or as if this were a good argument: England, Scotland, Ireland,
Denmark, Swethia, many states in Germany, and many men in France and else
where, have rejected the authority of the Pope his holiness, and the Sea of
Rome: therefore Italy, France, Spain and other catholic countries may do the
like. Fourthly, the said good fathers with their ringleader, and muster-master
father Parsons, do take upon them in the said book and in other treatises to
deal with matters of succession and titles of the crown: as if their bare
words were of higher authority then either Court Parliamentall, Prince, or
Pope: and because as it seems their said ringleader is a bastard himself, it
is wonderful to see what very small account he makes of succession by
inheritance, title of descent, birthright or blood. Now tell me in this case. A
gentleman, or substantial yeoman having one heir and many servants, dies:
were he not an ass that would affirm that the right of the said heir should
depend upon the pleasure of his fathers servants: If they thought meet, he
should have his fathers lands: or otherwise, they would bestow them as they
thought good. I am sure you would account it unjust, unnatural, indecent, and
ridiculous. And all that this traitorous Jesuit writes of this point, is
grounded upon the like folly: whilst he labors so giantlike in opposing
himself against succession by inheritance to fight most impudently with all
laws, nay with nature and with God himself.

Hereunto it also appertains how after he has contrived the means as he
thinks, how to deprive kings and heirs from their inheritance: he then
takes upon him, to appoint how others may and are to succeed in their rooms,
and possess their ancient right. And he proceeds herein as gravely and
substantially, as he has done in the premises. For except this may carry a
show of a good argument five hundred or a thousand years since, the ancestors
of the king of Spain, the king of France, and of diverse other kings, had no
interest to the kingdoms, which now they enjoy: therefore some others must be
found out to be preferred to those kingdoms: the good father says nothing.
There is one who has written a book of the Bathes in England: and as I
remember (for it is long since I saw the book) the author of it, the rather to
extol the first finder out, of the said Bathes, that thereby he might prove him
to be an ancient gentleman, does set down his petigree, and never leaves it
(I assure you) until he come to these words: which was the son of Seth,
which was the son of Adam. It were not amiss in my poor opinion, that
Master Parsons should carefully seek out for this ma^s kindred. It is not
unlikely, but that by his skill, he might entitle them to very many kingdoms;
distributing this to one, and that to another, as in his omnipotentencie he
should hold it most convenient. The man if he live long will prove mad in the
end without question: except you can imagine that these and such like vanities
are sober conceits. And yet that which he says against the blood royal of
England, to advance a pretended interest to the Infanta of Spain, is more
intolerable then these such idle speculations before mentioned. For it is
grounded not only upon the said most sottish speculation against all the kings
that live; but likewise upon a most slanderous and traitorous lie, in making
all the kings and Queens that have been for above two hundred years in this
land, to have been usurpers, tyrants, traitors and I wot not what. And that
which does not a little move my patience; this bastardly Jesuit does father
this traitorous assertion upon that worthy person Cardinal Allane, from whom I
durst be sworn he never had them, nor so vile a conceit ever harbored in his
breast. Whilst I have been diverse times thinking of this fellows writings
touching these and such like matters: I have wo^dred with my self how possibly
he could be so blind, as not to foresee: that when kings should understand,
what a plot he has laid for the overthrow of all authority, by setting up and
advancing a popular fury: they should find thereby very just cause given unto
them, to detest both him and all the generation of Jesuits, or any other
catholics whosoever, that should teach or defend such bloody and traitorous
doctrine. But I have stood too long upon this point: if you can procure Master
Charles Pagets book against father Parsons, you shall find the fox so
uncased and left so naked of all honesty, wisdom or judgment touching these
points: as you may well think my pains herein to have been needless, except
you will remember that my drift is only to let you understand, that father
Parsons and his fellows are great intermedlers with matters of state, and
succession especially, concerning the English crown, which when they shall be
out of all hope ever to obtain: I am verily persuaded there will some of them
run mad about it; they are so extremely egar upon it: and in such a desperate
jealousy and fear of loosing it. And therefore will I proceed therein a
little further by his Masterships leave. For as the said father Parsons has
laid his plot when England shall be Spanish: how the ancient law of this
realm shall be abrogated, and the civil law advanced in the place thereof: so
has the provident gentleman another treatise of reformation in store, how to
establish amongst us when that time shall come, the ancient law termed Lex
Agraria. Because that (as it seems) his mastership is of opinion, that the
nobility of England have too large and great possessions: and therefore by one
of his rules, in the said reformation: their abilities and what they shall
yearly spend, must be limited unto them: as also what retinue they shall
keep, and what their diet shall be. The like course he has also ordained for
the Bishops and clergy: they must be put to their pensions, and the overplus
is to be at the direction of the Jesuits: to be employed by the appointment of
their General resident always in Rome propter bonum societatis and ordine ad
Deum. Of all which follies, although I have told you in part before; yet they
coming so fitly to hand, as best agreeing to this Quodlibet of succession:
they can do no harm to be repeated again. But now, if any man think it
impossible that these fellows should be thus bewitched with these vain
conceits: let him but consider the nature of pride, ambition and liberty, into
what a fools paradise they are able to cast any manner of persons or
professions, that are possessed with them. They can hardly think of any thing,
but they account themselves worthy of it: and able by their wits to effect it,
even the very supreme power and church of S. Peter, such is their ambition. And
for their liberty they are men exempted from the jurisdiction of all the
superiors of the clergy; saving to their own officers, whereby as lawless
libertines, they write, do and say what they list, and dream of (I know not
what) Jesuitical monarchy. And thus far of this general point, that those
men do not slander the Jesuits, that charge them to be greater statists then
they would be accounted, and thereby to transgress all ancient orders of
religious persons, and to show themselves as runnagates and degenerated from
their own profession.

THE III. ARTICLE.
Whether is it profitable or expedient for the church of God, that the
Jesuits, as father Parsons in sundry of his writings, and so generally all the
rest in effect of that society, and some other of their humor, should oppose
themselves so much as they do against princes in extenuating their authority
upon every occasion: and eftsoons by telling the world what small interest and
hold they have of their kingdoms: as that in this case and that case: or if
they do this: or will not do that: then forthwith dominium amittitur: all is
lost, they cease to be kings, and what else (if they escape with their lives)
it shall please their fatherhoods to tell us.

THE ANSWER.
I Think their course therein to be neither profitable nor expedient for the
church: but on the contrary very pernicious and dangerous and especially in
these our days. First, because I do not find that the Apostles sent by our
Savior Jesus Christ to preach the Gospel, did inculcate any such matters or
points, either of doctrine or policy: yea in their writings (for ought I see)
there is no such thing expressed: neither do I remember that any history does
tell us of any such course; but rather the quite contrary, to have been held
by them. Secondly, the heathen kings both before the coming of Christ and in
the Apostles times, did suppose their titles to their kingdoms to be much
more firm: and their subjects being both learned and wise men, skillful in all
humane knowledge and laws, did thereof assure them, terming them to be the
very life and souls of their kingdoms. And it was accounted in the primitive
Church, a great slander to the Gospel and catholic doctrine of the church of
Christ, when some did report that the doctrine of the Christians was injurious
to the empire or civil magistracy, as tending to the diminishing of their
right and authority. Thirdly, if either the Apostles, in those times, or their
successors afterward in the Primitive Church, should have written or preached
of these matters, as now the Jesuits do: they would out of question, have
been cut off presently. It is true: that although they took a very mild
course, yet they endured great persecutions, and were very many of them put to
death. But if they had been of the Jesuits spirit: it is not probable that
any but the Jews (who had traiterous hearts to the Empire) would ever have
endured to have heard them speak. We see that if their enemies could but
devise some little show though most falsely, that they touched Caesar's
authority: it was sufficient to cry out against them, that they were not worthy
to live. Nay how sought they to have entangled Christ himself, by their
question of tribute, which he dissolved, not like a Jesuit though Caesar was
an Infidel, but as all true Catholic Priests ought to do: saying in direct
terms give unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and unto God that which is his
own of due right. Fourthly, the Apostles followed the steps of their Master.
For he being suspected by king Herod to aspire by degrees to the Empire,
cleared himself thereof by paying of tribute: and by teaching all other
subjects to give unto Caesar that which was Caesar's right. Then his Apostles
afterward understanding that it was commonly conceived, that the doctrine of
the Gospel taught such points and preceps, as were very prejudicial to the
state of the Empire and other kings and Princes, they to purge that suspicion
did so often in their writings commend and extol the authority of all Emperors,
kings, and Princes: showing the same to proceed from God himself, and to be
his own ordinance. Non est potestas nisi a Deo, said Saint Paul to the
Romans. And Civil Magistrates are sent from God said Saint Peter. Ministri
Dei sunt, thus they taught for the justifying of the Magistracy of such as were
at that time Infidels and persecutors: never mentioning that thereby they had
lost their Empire or kingdoms, or that they might justly be deposed, or any
such matter as our Jesuits in the like case do now a days affirm. Fifthly,
the holy Fathers of the Primitive Church, following the Apostles, as they
followed Christ: when they found that (through the malice of Satan) the same
objections (amongst many other) were still insisted upon against the
Christians and their doctrine, as if all had tended to the impeachment of the
Monarchy and treachery toward the Emperors: they bent themselves to refell
those slanderous imputations. Justinius Martyr, Athenagoras, and Tertullian,
succeedingly did write diverse discourses, and some to the Emperors themselves:
wherein they acknowledged as much as the Apostles had taught them. And thus
these ancient fathers said of the authority of their Emperors: being still
Infidels, and persecutors: Noster est magis Caesar vt a nostro Deo constitutus:
Lo, we (quoth Tertullian in his Apology) have more interest in Caesar then
the heathen; because he is appointed Emperor by our God, and not by the false
Gods, whom they worship. The name of an Emperor a Deo traditur; Dicam plane
Imperatore^ dominu^. I will plainly call the Emperor my Lord and Master. Inde
est Imperator, vnde est, and homo antequam Imperator, inde potestas illi, vnde
and spiritus. He that made him a man, made him an Emperor: from him he has his
authority, who gave unto him life. Sciunt, etc. Christians know, who gives the
Emperors authority, and that they are in their Empires, a Deo secundi; post
quem primi. The second person to God himself and next him the first. With
Tertullian the other two fathers before named, do in effect very fully agree:
whose doctrine you see does no way sound like the aforesaid tune of Iesuitisme.
Sixthly, I have not read all the rest of the ancient fathers: some of them I
have: but neither by mine own reading have I found, nor ever heard it reported
by any of credit, that the said fathers did in their times, either preach or
write any otherwise of the authority of magistrates, although Infidels and
persecutors, nay Apostataes: then as you have heard Christ, his Apostles,
Justinius Martyr, Athenagoras, and Tertullian did. I will only trouble you with
S. Augustine, who is most plain; That whether the king be good or bad, mild
or tyrannous, bountiful to the church or a persecutor: one that imbraceth the
Gospel and Cath. Roman faith, or is become an Apostata, yet they are Gods
lieuetenants; their power and sovereignty are both from God; of him they hold
their kingdoms, and are to be obeyed in all things which are not against the
law, divine, and Gods church here militant on earth: as for their paying of
tribute, fighting his battles, defending their countries, and such like. Read
(if you please) that which he writes upon the 13. Chapter to the Romans, and
in his fifth book De Ciuitate Dei. Cap. 22. and upon the 124. Psalm; in which
last place you shall find, that he mantaineth in precise terms, that Julian by
his Apostasy was not held to have lost the Empire, or his right, interest and
title that be had before unto it: but obeyed by the Christians propter Dominum
aeternum, because the eternal God would have it so. Now, no king be he vicious,
a schismatike or an heretic, can be thought with any reason so evil, as an
Apostata. It is worse to slide from the faith of Christ totaliter, wholly; then
aliqua ex part, as it is apparent in Saint Thomas. Seventhly, I am of his
opinion, that as the receiving of the Catholic faith and Gospel of Christ,
cannot make a private man to be a temporal king: so the rejecting of the same
faith, etc. cannot make a king a private man. And indeed to my understanding
(saluo semper meliori iudicio) it were against all reason it should be
otherwise. As for example a Simili, A Farmor being a heathen man, and having
the lease of a manor which is not good in law, does receive the faith of
Christ, and so becomes a Christian. Were it not an absurd conceit for any man
to think, that the receiving of the Christian faith, should make the said bad
lease to be sound and substantial? Likewise, on the other side, the said
Farmer, having as sufficient a lease (as law can make it) of another manor,
does return again to Paganism. It would seem to me as absurd, if any person
should imagine that the said lease or his right unto it were thereby any whit
impaired. Again, when men receive the Gospel and are baptized (be they kings
or private men, it alters not our case) they receive thereby an interest to
the kingdom of heaven, but no further right to their worldly inheritance then
they had before. And so also for the contrary. If any king or private person,
being a Christian, and withal a Catholic, do fall out of the Catholic church
and forsake the faith of Christ, it is a sufficient punishment for him to loose
thereby his inheritance and right to the joys of heaven, though for his
worldly state he be left as the church (in puris naturalibus) did find him.
And the same is in my judgment in an other like case. If the heir apparent of
any Catholic king or other prince, were either addicted to heresy, or should
become an Apostata. I being borne to be his subject, would use my uttermost
endeavor to reclaim him; but if that purpose would not prevail with him
(which I know God has appointed to be the ordinary means for men's
conuersions) I hold it were a very impious part either in me or in any other
private person being his subject, if we should seek to prevent him of his
right, or if it lay in our powers should take upon us to give it unto another,
were he never so good a Catholic that had no right thereto. Justinius Martyr
speaking of the duty of Christians to the civil Magistrate in those times of
Infidels and persecutors, affirms that they prayed not only for the Emperors
themselves, but also for their sons, that they might succeed them in the
Empire, quod aequissimum est, which (says he) is most agreeable to justice and
equity: were they like to prove as evil as their fathers there is no
exceptions of it. The which I rather observe to show my dislike of Fa. Parsons
in this point: who is accustomed upon every occasion, when he is in his best
mood, to affirm that he cares not who it is, from whence he comes, or what
right he has to the crown of this kingdom, that when the time comes shall
be able to catch it, so he be a Catholic.

But concerning both this point and the former, least it should be said, that
whilst I would seem to give a reason of that which I have in hand: I do only
show my opinion, and illustrate the same with similitudes, that are of as great
uncertainty as that which I propound: I will confirm my opinion with the
judgment of a principal man to whom there will no great exception be taken:
and then that which I have said will prove to be an argument ab authoritate.
Thus he writes, Soloiure naturali, and diuino non priuatur aliquis Dominio in
subditos, propter peccatum Apostasiae in fide etc. If you go no further then
to the law of nature, or to the law of God: no king is deprived from his
sovereignty over his subjects, though it be for the sin of Apostacy from
faith. And he gives a very sound reason for this his assertion, nam
fundamentum dominij non est fides, etc. For faith is not the ground of
dominion, but some other politic title having force by the law of nations, of
succession by inheritance, or of election, or of just acquisition, by just
war, Qui tituli possunt etiam manner sine fide: neque vnquam extat ius
aliquod diuinum, quo eiusmodi tituli eneruantur propter defectionem a side:
which titles may remain without faith, neither is there any law of God
whereby such titles are impeached for defection from faith. 8. I know that iure
ecclesiastico, and by the authority and sentence of the Popes holiness, much
more may be done then here I will speak of. But yet I think it will prove in
the end the best course, for men not to do so much as they may. Many things be
lawful which are not expedient. And this Jesuitical course of down with
princes, when they offend them, may peradventure so provoke them, as they will
say as fast down with priests, and of a certainty we shall have the worse.
When they find that the titles of their kingdoms cannot be touched, either by
the law of nature or by the law of God, do what they list, it may give them
occasion to oppose themselves with greater severity against the Sea
Apostolic, in that the same should make such extreme laws voluntarily against
them, as should tend to the thrusting of them out of their kingdoms. And out
of question it will be subject (if once they take this course) to great
iangling, whether such laws as should touch the deposing of a king, are not
rather to be accounted laws civil and temporal, then any matter or subject
fit for ecclesiastical men or laws to work upon. We see already that some
kings do take upon them to deal, and make laws in causes ecclesiastical,
denying his holiness authority therein within their kingdoms. And will it not
seem a thing much more plausible and probable: if other kings shall stand upon
it, and say; that his holiness has no interest to make any civil or temporal
laws, that may touch their freeholds? Nay if things should come to this
rifling, I fear they would in their heat go further, and tell his holiness,
that for ought they find, kings have as great authority to depose priests, as
priests have to depose kings. Besides it must be confessed, that all priests,
Jesuits, and every other sort of clergy men (the Popes holiness excepted) are
borne subjects of kings and princes* and it will be an odious assertion to say,
that the taking of priesthood upon them, should give them warrant to bristle,
and make head against their sovereigns. Furthermore, it cannot be denied
(shift the Jesuits with all their cunning never so prettily) but the immunities
which priests have from the temporal laws of kings, do proceed (as Saint
Thomas acknowledges) from their mere favor and godly zeal toward them.
Also it is most manifest, that as the kings of England have been most
bountiful to the church and churchmen here within their dominions, in so much
as all the revenues and temporalties with many singular privileges (which in
this realm our forefathers have enjoyed) have proceeded from their most
princely liberality and authority: so stands the case of the clergy in all
other kingdoms; which two points would be duly considered of in time. For if
princes should by the same means seek to spoil the church, and take from it
all her said immunities, privileges and temporal possessions: it will little
avail to bring in our distinctions how parliaments may give what they list to
the church and churchmen, but they can take nothing either from them or from
the church. What the power of a parliament is in England, we have had too great
experience, and I suppose the states in other kingdoms have the like. And
therefore in all policy, kings and sovereign princes are not to be ruffled
with, in this Jesuitical manner. That which they may pretend, how in these
their discourses they aim but at some one or two, does indeed touch all kings,
if they incur the displeasure of his holiness. Surely though I humbly
acknowledge my self to be minimus fratrum meorum, and neither arrogate to my
self to be of such mature judgment as many are, nor will presume to take upon
me so peremptorily on the one side, as Father Parsons does on the other (though
unlearnedly God wot) yet I find many great dangers that may happen to the
Catholic Roman church, if these violent spirits be not in time suppressed.
Such furious insulting over princes will never do good. They may be drawn
many ways by gentle and mild proceedings with them, rather then by such
indiscreete and desperate courses, whereby they grow to greater resistance. For
if the Popes holiness in times past dealt so sharply (as it seems with
Baldemarus king of Denmark that he writ in this sort to the supreme Pastor:
Notum tibi facimus, vitam nos habere a Deo: nobilitatem a parentibus: regnum a
subditis: fidem ab ecclesia Romana: quam si nobis inuides remittimus per
presents. Be it known unto thee, that we have our life from God: our nobility
from our parents: our kingdom from our subjects: our religion from the church
of Rome: the which if you malign us for it, we send you back again by these
presents: then what shall we think? or can we imagine that sovereign princes
of this our unfortunate age will brook it well, to find his holiness to be tam
durus Pater toward them? But for mean subjects to presume as the Jesuits do:
never was it, and now is it least tolerable.

THE IIII. ARTICLE.
WHether it is a fit point of doctrine to be broached and diuulged to the
world in these days by the Jesuits, that subjects are no longer bound to
obey wicked Princes in their temporal commandments and Laws but till they be
able by force of arms to resist them?

THE ANSWER.
THat this is a most dangerous doctrine, and most unfit to be published in this
age: there is no one Catholic in England this day, but, I think, will
confess it: and therefore I hold it meet before I come directly to answer this
Article. First, to make it apparent that the Jesuits and their seditious
faction do broach and publish such a kind of doctrine: for otherwise it might
well seem a slander maliciously imputed unto them. Amongst others, father
Parsons in his admonition before mentioned, gives this reason, why the Popes
sentence has not been put in execution since it was first given, because
(forsooth) her Majesty's forces were so great, that they could hardly be
resisted by the only Inhabitants of the Realm, without evident danger and
destruction of very many and noble persons etc. in which case the censures of
the Church do not bind: which is as much to say, as if they had been of
might sufficient, they had been bound to have put the said sentence in
execution against her highness, and the overthrow of the whole state and common
wealth of their native land. The same Jesuit also in his book entitled
Philopater is very peremptory, sly, and saucy (as his manner is) very boldly
affirming, that when kings do deflect from the Catholic religion and draw
others with them. Liberes esse subditos, etc. posseque and debere (si vires
habeant) buiuscemodi homine^ dominatu^ eijcere. Subjects are free and both may
and ought (if they be able) to cast such a man out of his dominions. Secondly,
when Henry the third of France had procured the death of the Duke of Guise and
some other (whereunto the French writers do affirm he was compelled except he
would have suffered the Duke to have pulled the Crown from his head) it was not
long after but that by the secret practices of the Jesuits he himself was
murdered. And not resting thus contented: they writ such a discourse against
him being a Catholic, as if it had been hatched in hell: entitled, De iusta
abdicatione, H. 3. In which treatise they affirm, that it is lawful for a
private man to kill a tyrant (for so they termed that king) though there be
neither sentence of the Church or kingdom against him. Now in this book (to
come to my purpose) he propounds this objection: how and why it was, that in
the Primitive Church the martyrs attempted no such course against the tyrants
that then reigned, and does answer it in this sort: V^^d laudable est cum
resistere nequeas; ita vbi p^ssis nolle resistere religionis, and patriae hosti
nefarium ac pernitiosum est: As much to say, as thus in English, As it is
laudable to do as those martyrs did when thou can not resist, so not to
resist when thou may the enemy of Religion and of thy country (so they term
all kings that they dislike) is a pernicious and horrible sin. Thirdly, an
other at that time, with a Jesuitical spirit does tell us his mind in plain
terms: so as I shall not need to prove the matter by any consequence. The
quarrel for Religion (says he) and defense of innocence is so just that
heathen Princes not at all subject to the Churches laws and discipline may in
that case by the Christians arms be resisted: (naming none, but speaking in
general terms without exception of persons, so indefinitely or rather
peremptorily and dissemblingly (as all Jesuits do) that as well servants as
souer^ignes, may by his principle, take arms at their pleasure, etc.) And
might lawfully have been redressed in the time of the Pagans and first great
persecutors ^hen they vexed and oppressed the faithful. And again, There is
no question but that the Emperor Constantine, Valens, Julian, and others, might
have been by the Bishop excommunicated and deposed and all their people
released from their obedience, if the Church or Catholics had had competent
forces to have resisted. Lo what doctrine this is, to be diuulged in this so
dangerous an age. I leave to others to conceit these things in as good sense
as may make for our general safety and common good of the Catholic cause:
only I wish such passages had never fronted any English Port, nor come to our
adversaries ears or knowledge. And an other Jesuit to the same purpose says.
Quod si Christiani olim non deposuerunt Neronem and Diocletianum and Iulianum
Apostatam, ac Valentem Arrianum and alios: id fuit quia de erant vires
temporales Christianis. Nam alioquin iure potuissent hoc facere. In that
Christians in times past did not depose Nero, and Dioclesian, and Julian the
Apostata, and Valence the Arrian and others: it was because Christians did then
want temporal forces, for otherwise they might lawfully have dealt so with
them. Now what think you if such a doctrine had been heard or spoken of in
Iulians, Neroes, or Dioclesians days: what think you would have ensued
thereof? Questionless, though the persecution were great, yet probably it
would have been double increased and augmented thereby. And as for the
scholemen, which they allege for this doctrine, one and the chief is S.
Thomas who has some such point. For Christians (says he) obeyed Iulianus.
Quod illo tempore Ecclesia in sua nouitate nondum habebat potestatem terrenos
principes coercendi, and ideo tollerauit fideles Iulano Apostatae ohedire in
ijs quae non erant contra fidem vt maius periculum fidei vitaretur, etc.
Because the Church then being in her infancy had not yet power to bridle
Princes, and therefore she did tolerate the faithful to obey Julian the
Apostata in those things which were not against faith, for the avoiding of a
greater danger, which might otherwise have insued to the Christian faith. The
other is Dominus Bannes upon Saint Thomas, who alleging that the cause why
catholics in England do not rebel against her Majesty, is: Quia facultatem
non habent, etc. Both whose opinions and words as they may carry a diverse
construction: so were they not set down by either of them as conclusions, but
as argumentall reasons of doctrine disputatiue in the schools. Which no
question if they had lived in our days, and withal under Englands allegiance
they would either have forborne, or that speech have qualified. Touching Bannes
though of this age, yet a Spaniard he was, and therefore his doctrine is less
strange for this point. But let that pass. I blame him not for holding what
opinion he list disputatiue: because it is an ordinary matter so to do, yea
and that in points of very great importance; one scholeman holding an opinion
in matters that are not directly of faith, quite contrary and against one an
other. And so could I well have borne with father Parsons (if a schooleman, as
he is not, he had been) to have holden what opinion he listed, in the schools
or for disputations sake concerning the conueniency or inconueniency of
publishing this doctrine. Marry withal I wish from my heart that he had left it
there still, and buried it in silence under his deske that it had never come
within ken of an English eye, nor within the sound of our adversaries jealous
ears. But seeing that published it is by them, and that in an other and worse
sense then either S. Thomas or Bannes ever dreamed of; as tending wholly to a
Puritanes popularity, as hereafter shall be proved: therefore must it needs
follow to be a most pernicious doctrine and very unfit to have been published
to the world, in these so dangerous times as wherein we all do live. And by
consequent it necessarily must and shall be improued and father Parsons justly
convinced of treason and error for publishing of it, like a right Puritan
which I prove by this discourse following.

Buchanan that archtraytor of Scotland, in his book De iure regni apud Scotos,
has written at length to this very purpose: against whom master Blockwood a
worthy man and a sound catholic, did very learnedly oppose himself, and
has at large confuted this monstrous conceit very substantialy. All the
Buchanans and Jesuits in Christendom will never be able to answer him in that
point. When Saint Paul (says Buchanan as master Blockwood alleges his words)
commanded the Romans to obey the superior powers appointed by God he writ so,
In ipsa nascentis ecclesiae infantia, cum christiani, nec numero, nec opibus,
nec authoritate valerent, ac proinde eorum duntaxat ad quos scribebat, non
autem vniuersorum ciuium rationem habuisse: In the infancy of the church
(says this sacrilegious traitor, to sacred Majesty ever blasphemous:)
Christians flourished not either in number, or in wealth, or in authority: and
therefore Saint Paul had only respect of those to whom he writ, (that were not
able to rebel) and meant not that his precept should be held for a perpetual
law, when Christians should grow afterward to be of greater force. Would not
a man think he had heard a Jesuit all this while. But let Buchanan go
forward. In those times Christians were feign to shroud or hide themselves
under the obedience of princes and magistrates though they were wicked, and
under the shadow of any kind of dominion whatsoever: because they were poor:
few of them citizens, but strangers: and for the most part such as had been
bondmen, and the rest trades men, and servants that with great toil sustained
themselves. And therefore Saint Paul admonished them vt temrori seruirent: that
they should dissemble for the time being mindful of their condition, and not
peep out of their holes, much less seek to trouble those that were in
authority. But if Saint Paul lived now adays when not only the people but
princes do profess Christianity: and when Christians are equal both in
number and strength to match tyrants: he would command the multitude to inquire
into the said tyrants proceedings, and as they saw cause to put them to death.
Thus far this Scottish bloodsucker, and enemy to all regal sovereignty: to
whom father Parsons and the said Jesuits that writ of the deposition of Henry
3. are exceedingly beholden. For he in his book of succession, and the other
in their said discourse, do follow him up and down, step by step so directly,
as if they had purposed to have professed themselves to be his scholars, and
to defend whatsoever he has written, were it never so desperate, impious,
profane, and more then heathenish. Thus you hear what the Jesuits doctrine
is, and how iumpe, turn Turk, and Puritan like, they have proceeded therein.
Now follow their grounds. For the grounds and foundation of this Jesuitical
and Puritan doctrine of obedience, till subjects have force to rebel: you may
please to understand that it is built upon a new fond exposition of the
Scriptures: as partly you have heard, which is a very dangerous point, and will
give our common adversaries exceeding advantage against us: in that hitherto we
have pretended to follow in all matters of controversy with them, that sense
of the Scriptures which was generally received by the ancient fathers, and have
greatly inueighed against their new expositions: whereby they wring at woorst
the written word, that it may seem to speak no other wise then they would
have it. And that now the Jesuits in this case do run the same course it is
manifest. In testimony whereof: whereas the example of the Jews by Ieremies
direction under Nabuchodonozor has been generally held for a president for
all christians: (if ever they shall happen to come into the like bondage) so
the practice of Christ concurring with it, in paying tribute to Caesar a wicked
king, and commanding all men to do the like: and with this precept also the
rules of the Apostles fitly agreeing in prescribing all Christians of what
calling soever generally to obey and perform all duties of subjects to all
superior powers, and particularly to kings, as those being more excellent then
the rest (the civil magistrates being then likewise wicked persons and
persecutors:) adding hereunto the general expositions of the ancient fathers.
That the Apostles do speak in those places of such kind of civil governors
as here we entreat of: and that all Christians if they happen to live under
such like kings, are to obey them, and to submit themselves unto all their
temporal and lawful commandments it is clear: yet all this
notwithstanding, out come these new illuminates the Jesuits, and as if they
were become Caluinists, they take upon them with their new glosses to avoid
and elude the true sense and ancient interpretations of all these places. The
Jews (say they) were commanded diuinitus extraordinarily to obey and pray for
Nabuchodonozor: which ordinarily binds not: Christ paid tribute, and spoke
as a private person. The Apostle Saint Paul meant that his precepts should be
generally understood of obedience to good kings only: and Saint Peter when he
commands all Christians to be subject to the king, quasi praecellenti: that
is (says one) when the king does excel in virtue and not otherwise: and
father Parsons in his book of titles (omit his absurd Appendix, wherein he
runs riot in this point of rebellion and popularitie) says: that where
Solomon affirms: By me kings reign: and Saint Paul avouches that authority
is not but of God: and therefore he that resists authority resists God:
these places are to be understood of authority, power, or jurisdiction in it
self according to the first institution: for otherwise when it is unjustly
used, it may be resisted in many cases even by the commons or multitude: whom
in his Appe^dix he binds in conscience to rebel etc. which kind of shifts
we have ever detested: and therefore now you shall hear what we think of
this doctrine. To speak plainly my mind in this case, with all humble
submission to the Catholic church and censure of my opinion herein. I hold
this doctrine of the Jesuits in these days to be an open way to Atheism, so
to expound the Apostles as that they might be thought to temporize, which is a
plain kind of dissimulation. For there being question made concerning the
doctrine of the Catholic church and Gospel of Christ, as though it had
impeached the authority of the civil Magistracy: the Apostles to clear
themselves of so false an imputation did of purpose propose the contrary, and
prescribed such obedience and duty to all subjects, as was by the laws of God
and all nations due unto them. But if the Apostles had been of the Jesuits
opinion in this matter, and would have dealt truly, sincerely and directly (as
the Jesuits do never) when such a doubt was made by the States where they
preached: they should have answered to this effect, scil. If you that are
Emperors, kings, and worldly governors do mean to continue your wicked
courses in opposing your selves against Christ and us his servants, we are (by
the doctrine of our Master Christ and authority committed unto us) to seek
your confusion, and to deprive you from your Empires, kingdoms and governments
as soon as we are able to make head against you: or if any of you will be
content to hear and obey us: we must tell you that, whereunto you must trust,
which is; that when once you have submitted your selves to this our said
doctrine, If you shall not forever afterward conform your behavior and
conversation according to our rules and prescription, we must be bold with you,
and do the best we can to move your subjects to rebellion, and to depose you
likewise as soon as they shall have competent strength to encounter with you:
and in default thereof, it is our duty to persuade by all the policies we can
devise, some of your neighbor princes to take your subjects parts for your
utter ruin. Inter bonos been agere oportet, We profess our selves to be
teachers of the truth, and therefore we cannot choose being urged unto it in
this particular: but to signify the truth unto you, after our plain and
direct proceedings with all men.

Now if such a kind of answer to have been made by the Apostles do seem
most absurd, then what wicked and absurd wretches are these good fathers, who
by their interpretations do impose it upon them, if they had dealt sincerely?
Or if the Apostles should have meant indeed as these men would have them, and
as it is before expressed; then what might the world have thought of them, that
(to cover such tragical points of blood and rebellion and to abuse princes:
they did pretend nothing but prayers, paying of tributes, honoring of kings,
and obeying of them for conscience sake. But this course was far from the
blessed Apostles. It is indeed very well befitting the puritanes and the
Jesuits, such as Parsons, Creswell, etc. who are the me^ that teach and
practice it. For it is their doctrine by dissimulation and hypocrisy, by lying
and equiuocating to seduce their hearers. But what says Master Blockwood to
Buchanan, Paulus vtendum fore precepit? Laruatam hypocrisin sub persona
religionis latere voluit? Potestatibus obediendum edixit quia resisti non
posset? Christianos viribus admotos, ad armacessantes ad arma concitat,
imperiumque frangit? Did Saint Paul command us to be time seruers? Was it his
mind, that religion should be disguised with such a visard of hypocrisy? Did
he command men to obey the magistrates, because they were not able to resist
them? Did he provoke them to arms when their number and strength served, and
bad down with the Emperor? This is right Mahumetisme, and tends to the
overthrow of the Gospel and church Catholic, the sweet spouse of Christ, and
therefore is to be detested cane peius and angue.

Fifthly, this Jesuitical dream does derogate so much from the Majesty of
holy Scripture and the churches authority, as thereby the vanity of it is very
manifest and apparent. For what (says Master Blockwood to Buchanan) Itan'
diuinas leges vt humanas Aristotelis mensurarum similes esse putas? Do thou
think Gods laws as Aristotle speaks of humane laws: that they are like
measures that they should turn with the weathercocke, and change with the
conditions of times and places. No no, much more truly, and as it were by
divine inspiration does he express the strength and constancy of divine
laws, who says Non erit etc. There shall not one law be at Rome, an other
at Athens, now one and then an other, but there shall be one immortal law for
all Nations and all times, and Imperator omnium Deus, and God shall be Lord and
Emperor of all. He is the Inuenter, the expounder and the giver of this law:
which he that will not obey, is his own enemy, and maximas poenas luet, and he
shall never escape grievous punishments. And such were Christ's and his Apostles
precepts, not subject to alteration and change, not framed to serve the time,
not fitted to this or that private person or plebian multitude, one while
commanding obedience to tyrants, and presently after to take up arms against
them, but as we are to think of the very laws of God, their rules of
obedience are permanent, and to continue unchangeable whilst this world
endures.

Furthermore, it is to be supposed, that the Church of God in the times of
Justinius Martyr and Tertullian did understand the meaning of Christ and of his
Apostles in this point as well as Parsons or any of his crew. But it would have
seemed a strange doctrine both to them and all other Catholics that had the
fear of God before their eyes, or any spark of true and unfeigned Catholic
religion in their hearts in those days: to have heard it set down for positive
Divinity, that notwithstanding any thing that Christ or his Apostles taught as
touching obedience to kings and Princes: yet it is to be accounted a pernicious
and unspeakable sin for subjects being of sufficient force and ability not
to resist (for to that effect are father Parsons words in his Appendix) and
take arms against them, if they be evil and wicked. Instinus Martyr as I have
before observed having set down the duty of Christians toward the civil
magistrate the Emperor (then a wicked man and a persecutor) does in direct
terms affirm: that Christ had taught them such obedience and alleges his
very words: give unto Caesar that which is Caesar's. If it be here objected that
peradventure in Justinius time the Christians wanted number to depose the
Emperors. Tertullian will make the matter most manifest: that it was the only
will and pleasure of God revealed apparently by Christ and his Apostles, that
kept the Christians within the compass of their duties to the Emperors: when
otherwise they wanted neither number nor strength to have been revenged of
them. When the Christians labored from time to time to purge themselves from
sundryfalse imputations, and from this one amongst the rest: that whereas they
professed their obedience to the Emperor, it was only but for fear: and that
if they had strength enough, they would then show themselves to be his enemies:
and take up arms against him. Tertullian writes to this effect. Neque est vt
obijciatis: Neither is there any cause you should object unto us: that
therefore we dissemble the injuries done unto us, because we want force to
revenge them. For every one of us is able although not openly, yet in secret to
do mischief enough, For what were more easily done, if it were lawful to
recompense evil with evil, then in the night to burn your City? Nay, if we
were disposed to profess our selves your enemies as you account us, we want
not strength of soldiers, but have greater force then those Nations that do
war daily against you. The Maures, and Parthians and other barbarous people
are but one Nation whose borders are limited: but of Christinns the number in
every place is almost infinite. There is no place nor order where there are not
Christians. So as if by our discipline we could take arms, we could make a
greater conspiracy against the Roman Empire then was hitherto ever made:
whether you respect force or courage. Hitherto Tertullian, as unlike to our
Jesuits: as dutiful subjects are unlike Rebels and traitors.

And for the better manifesting of our allegiance to our Sovereign unfeignedly
from our Catholic hearts, so many of us as are not of the Jesuits faction: I
will here a little enlarge my self to show what further testimony and reasons
we have to detest this Jesuitical and Puritanian doctrine. Saint Augustine who
lived in a troublesome time never dreamed: that the Scriptures did warrant
subjects no longer to obey wicked kings, then they had power and force to
rebel. If he were now alive, our Jesuits would surely set him to school
again. For whereas in his exposition upon the 124. Psalm, he has at large
discoursed: how servants and subjects by receiving the Catholic faith and
Gospel of Christ, are not in any sort released from their duties, services,
and subjection to their Masters, Lords, and Sovereigns, but are rather thereby
more straightly bound to perform the same diligently, truly, and faithfully,
as in the sight of God before whom they stand: he comes to this objection:
Sed numquid sic erit semper? vt iniusti imperent justice. But shall it be so
always? Shall the wicked still have commandment over the rest. To this
objection you know what father Parsons would say, viz. No it shall not be so
any longer, then that you shall be able to overthrow such governors and get you
better. And if in short time you shall not be able your selves so to do: I
will do my uttermost to procure you some assistance out of other Countries, by
foreign invasions, procuring excommunications, suspensions, interdictions,
depositions, and other means. But to omit this unnatural stepfather, let us
hear what S. Augustine (that worthy Prelate, light, lantern, pillar, and
Father of, and in the Catholic Church) will answer to the said objection.
Nunquid sic erit semper? Shall it always be so? Non sic erit, It shall not be
so? But when shall it be otherwise. The substance of his answer is: that it
shall be otherwise when Christ comes to judgment. Now (says he) we often
see, that there are many good Lords and masters: but when it happens otherwise,
it must be borne with. Quare? Why? vt non extendant, etc. that the just may not
stretch forth their hands to wickedness, and understand that such their service
and subjection is not everlasting: Sed preparent se ad possidendam sempiternam
haereditatem. And therefore reserving themselves for this lasting inheritance:
let them bear injuries, but do none. And his conclusion of all this discourse
is in these words: Haec cogitant qui voluntatem dei sequuntur, non voluntatem
suam: who follow Gods will and not their own. Now if this were the doctrine
of the catholic church in those days: then how inconvenient this Jesuitical
innovation is, and how dangerous to be published now a days, the state of al
catholics in England, but especially of priests, may make it to be evident. For
by this wicked assertion so soon as the number of catholics shall be so
increased as that they may be able to take arms against her Majesty, they are
bound in conscience so to do, and do grievously offend if they do otherwise:
nay they do incur the Popes excommunication (says father Parsons.) Now what
must her Highness and the state think of such subjects? does it not stand her
in hand to prevent that the number of catholics do not increase? if therefore
they do increase faster then she would, if sufficient testimony be not given
to the contrary, scil. that al are not of this Jesuitical faction, and
Puritanian opinion: has she not good cause given her to cut them off? I speak
after the manner of men: not presuming to tempt God with miracles. What could
any king or prince in Christendom being persuaded in religion as her Majesty
is, do otherwise: if he meant not to have the crown plucked from his head?
There is no way to prevent this mischief for ought I know, but that all
catholics do enter into a league and make a vow, that they never will give
care to these bloody Jesuits in that behalf, but utterly detest it: and that,
were their number and strength much more and greater then her Majesty's, they
will never be persuaded or drawn, either by threatenings or promises of any (be
it the Pope himself) to bear arms against her Highness, to the destruction of
her royal person and state: but be ready to adventure their goods and lives in
her Majesty's defense against him or any other that shall assail or invade by
hostile hand her state or kingdom under pretense of restoring of the
catholic faith or whatsoever. Nay, as many catholics as stand affected to
the Jesuits, considering how her Highness has been used by these their false
teachers: they shall think themselves most infinitely bound to her Majesty,
if notwithstanding they shall now vow and profess as is expressed: yet that
she shall be pleased to believe them: the doctrine of the Jesuits touching
equivocation has already bewitched so many of them. But principally what are
all catholic priests that are Iesuited to look for upon the broaching of this
desperate and devilish conceit? when the catholics are in number sufficient
they must rebel: and the innocent priests are sent over to increase this
number. Into what perplexities are they hereby cast? How can they expect any
favor when they are taken? none cannot deny that their coming over is to
increase the number of catholics: and that father Parsons reigns and has the
whole direction at this day for all the missions that are for England. How then
(alas) how may her Majesty and the state conclude against them? what laws can
be too extreme to keep them out of the land? or if they will needs come in:
what severity for the execution of laws against them can be more then
sufficient? Into what gulf are we plunged? nay into what an obloquie are we
plunged? nay into what an obloquie must the catholic church of Rome grow, in
that the execution of priesthood and treason are now so linked together by the
Jesuits in England, as we cannot exhort any to the catholic faith: but
dogmatizando in so doing we draw him in effect to rebellion? For the mitigation
therefore both of her Majesty and the state, and that they may deal more
mercifully with poor secular priests: I do here profess both for my self
and those that are not Iesuited (as too many are) that we loath, and detest
this point of Iesuitisme: that if we find that we can not otherwise prevail,
and that such as are catholics will needs run into these Jesuitical
courses of rebellion and treason: we will surcease from the execution of our
functions, and from the increasing of that number that will will not be advised
by us: with patience and suffering to expect the Lords leisure for the
restitution of the catholic faith: and in the mean time to obey her Majesty
as they did in Tertullians time, and as Saint Augustine does teach us in
lawful commandments and points perteining to civil government and temporal
laws.

THE V. ARTICLE.
Whether seeing this Buchanania^ doctrine of stirring up subjects to rebel
against their Sovereigns when they are of force, is so greedily snatched up of
the Jesuits, as it seems they would scorn not to be holden or accounted of,
as the first author, or at least practisioners of it in their own sense and
meaning: is it then the whole monarchy of all these northern Isles of
England, Scotland, and Wales that they shoot at? or else do they aim at the
crown monarchiall of England only? or otherwise at none at all directly: but
only for a superiority over the ecclesiastical and secular state.

THE ANSWER.
THey do questionles, cast at all both ecclesiastical, temporal and
monarchical states: as may be demonstrated by sundry arguments, conuincing them
of their no less treacherous and ambitious, then Pharisaicall and irreligious
intents, attemptes, practices and proceedings therein. First, for that in
precise terms they and theirs have given it out for England by name: that it
should be made an Island of Jesuits: and that they were assured of it, that the
king of Spain upon the conquest would bestow it upon them. Secondly, before
the Lady Infantaes title, marriage or placing in the Low countries was dreamed
of, the chief speeches was of the king her fathers title; and for hers it was
but then coldly handled. And if you mark well the tenor of his discourse
throughout his whole Dolmanian coined succession, you shall not find him
absolute in his opinion for Spain. And he frames all his passages to persuade
as well all our English nation, that it will be fittest and for the most
advancement of our nobles, and augmentiue flourish of the whole common wealth:
as also most secure, and to the greatest both merit and renown of the king
catholic, never to offer to come hither himself, or to enthronize his
majesty or royal issue within the Britons coasts, as a diminution of his
honor and princely regalitie, so to do: considering our country is so base,
obscure and beggarly: and the blood royal together with all the heroeces,
nobles and gentles of these northern Isles so abject, mean and ignominious
forsooth, where his Spanish paragons with their Mercurian gilded Caduceus come
in place. Lo dear Catholi^es, and all you dee^^ly affected (...) countries
(...) think (...) not b^^ that (...), and you (...) Ladies (...) she (...)
be^^^ (...). Pa^^^^ (...) the rest of (...) its (...) great (...) ^^gher
ad^a^ce^^^^, (...) you (...) the (...) the Spaniard (...) ^o^^aigne ^a^^^s, etc.
But the best, most convenient and contentiue course to be taken for all
parties is by this exlegall legifers laws set down; for the Spaniards to
bring this whole monarchiall Isle from the name, honor and title of
successionall regality, to be under a Viceroyes government and charge, and
there withal reduced into the form and fashion, and proportioned order of a
Province: to send the peers and other nobles (natives of this land that shall
take the Spaniards part) into foreign countries, as Sicily, Naples, Peru,
India, etc. to make them V^ceroyes there, and then to commit this Province to
the government of the fathers of the society of Jesus, sci. to our petty king
father, Fa. Parsons and the rest as I said before. Which assertion if it seem
absurd and to be but a surmise; then tell me I pray, what government can you
gather out of all his books that we shall have: or who shall be our king o^
sway the scepter royal of this land? For the king of Spain himself, it is to
mean for him, and therefore holden of Fa. Parsons for a dishonor if he should
leave Spain to keep here his royal Court. For his daughter the new
Archdutchesse of Austria, Duchess of Burgundy, and Lady of Netherlands: her
grace was but then glauncingly spoken of. Yea when Fa. Parsons had urged the
subscription and consent to her title, afterward to sundry of our nation (as
before is said) amongst the rest a reverend priest and anncient gentleman old
Master Midleton, being roughly handled by Fa. Parsons, and endangered in Spain
before his departure to Rome, for not consenting to his unnatural motion,
unless it might have been by marriage of the said Lady Infanta to some noble
or peer of our land. This cosening mate protesting at the first that it was
meant no otherwise, but she should: afterward when partly by force and fear,
partly upon hope to have gotten all his money out of this fathers hands (who by
your leave (under Benedicite be it spoken, cosened him at the last cast of
three hundred pound at least, as we have been credibly informed by reverend
priests then there, which he never could get out of his hands:) he consented
upon that condition to give his name to that charter of subscription. And then
lo what the good father added (quoth he) I could wish her Ladishippe married
into England: but they are all too mean, and none to be found worthy within
that Isle by birthe, calling, or any other abilities of so royal a Lady as she
is. It is wonderful how this Protheus windeth and turns, now this way, now
that way, and with what suppositions, exceptions, conditions, and quiddities he
handles this point. All which devises and the circumstances thereunto
belonging, being with mature judgment examined, and a thorough reuiew taken of
the whole scope and mark he shutes at, glauncing here and there at the popular
authority given to the subjects of this land to choose a king of their own:
do make it most apparent that his, and by consequent the rest of the Jesuits
meaning was, and is, if possibly they can bring it to pass. First, to destroy
our whole Nation by aid of the Spaniard, and Austrian, Burgundian,
Netherlandian, and such like German bred huff muff forces. Secondly, and then
having brought all into subjection, slavery and bondage, (especially the
ancient nobility and secular clergy, by sending the former into other
countries under pretense of advancement to higher honors, and suppressing the
latter as illiterate, unexperienced and unfit to govern or any way to be
advanced to the Ecclesiastical state) there must follow such weighty reasons
moving as well the king catholic, as the Lady Infanta to appoint some Regent,
Viceroy or other substitute under the^; as whether soever or who else besides
win it by conquest, or compremises, yet none but a Jesuit shall or can be
found fit, Penes quem imperium, To have the whole managing of all causes: and
to govern the whole Isle. Thirdly, the high Counsel of Reformation for
England, does make the case most clear, that they aspire to a Sovereignty
above all these Northen Isles, as well in causes Ecclesiastical as Temporal;
as if you please to peruse the Quodlibet here set down of that matter, you may
easily perceive: but more directly if you can get a sight of the book it
self. Only this consider by the way, that the chief point there touched being
an oeconomicall order set down to appoint all estates within what compass
they shall live by an Agrarian law, there is neither Priest nor lay person from
the highest to the lowest in either or any of the three ancient states of this
land: but must by that high Court of Parliament or Counsel of reformation
stand at the Jesuits devotion to fleet and swymme which way, and as their
fatherhoodes will have them, so as a Jesuit must be Dominus fac totum, in all
these northern Isles. Fourthly, the institution of the Archpriest is in such
form in their pretense: as it can not denotate less then a supremacy in time
to come over this whole Isle of England, Scotland, and Wales, and by consequent
then over Ireland as subject to England. For otherwise to what end is it that
Master Blackwell should have as full and ample jurisdiction over all Scotland,
as he has over England, considering that they have a catholic Bishop of their
own country and nation? And withal, to what purpose is it that certain
priests of late coming out of Spain, should be more urged, then others were
to obey him in what he should command: he still himself notwithstanding being
at the Jesuits devotion to stand or fall, and at their appointment and
direction to command, when, what, and where they will have him. Fifthly, the
most egregious, tyrannical, vsurpate, intrusiue authority of the Jesuits
gotten over all the Seminaries at Rome: at Saint Omars, in Spain, and at Deway
(for even the president there, is but a subject, servant or (some term him the
vassal of father Parsons) adding hereunto the like intendment for England, in
plotting to have had father Edmonds head of the afflicted Church in Duresse,
and father Garnet the supreme head of all the priests and catholics living
abroad at liberty; and both these then being but subordinate under Parsons, he
directing, appointing, and commanding all both here and there as he list and
as the general and his fatherhood shall judge: what else can this denotate,
then an absolute intendement of a Jesuitical monarchy. Sixthly, the presumed
plea they take upon them against the secular priests on his behalf attributing
unto him, Per argumentum e contra, The title of a Sovereign: by calling the
said seculars and all that appeal from him, rebels, etc. Which word howsoever
it may improperly be applied to any inferior, respecting his resisting of a
Superior; yet the common phrase of speech is, to use that word only as a
traitorous act or attempt of a subject against his Sovereign, And therefore
do we call traitors rebels: when they rise by resistance or inpugnance of
their Princes authority, laws, orders, or decrees. Whereas if it be but
against some noble or other private or public person: we call it a commotion, a
riot, quarrels, a fray, a contention, etc. But treason, rebellion, sedition,
and faction, do always presuppose such a superior as has none above him in
that state, calling, and condition of life wherein he lives as Sovereign, and
those that rebel, etc. as subjects under him. Forasmuch therefore as we
justly term the Jesuits traitors, rebels, seditious and factious persons, not
in regard of the contention that is betwixt them and us for superiority (which
they vainly arrogate to themselves over the seculars resisting their proud
attemptes, plots, and devises that way) but in respect of their tampering in
state matters, opposing themselves against their native Prince and Country,
and practicing the utter ruin and destruction of this land, by stirring up
both foreign powers to invade and home borne subjects to rise in arms,
adding hereunto their many libelles, slanderous and infamous speeches in
prejudice and against both Pope and Prince, church and common wealth and both
states: This being that act and those proceedings which make traitors, rebels,
factious and seditious persons indeed: they still crying Whoreson first in a
contrary sense, because (forsooth) we would not be obedient to the Archpriest,
even iumpe in the Jesuitical meaning, pretense, and action: therefore are we
called rebels, seditious, factious, etc. By which words they plainly attribute
a sovereignty to Master Blackwell in opposition, for causes ecclesiastical
against and above the Popes holiness: and for causes temporal over and against
her Majesty. And although that this be an ordinary passage amongst them to
call all that are not currants of Master Blackwels course, factious, seditious,
etc. Yet of all the rest, there is one Jesuit Fa. Holt by name, who uses this
word Rebel more then any or all the rest of his fellows, in a most arrogant
proud conceited letter of his to a very worthy Catholic Lady of special
note, name and esteem, as well for her calling, birth and abilities in gifts of
nature and fortune: as also for her rare virtues, religious piety, constancy
and other indowments and graces abounding in all works of charity. Whom how
this factious Jesuit (one of the right stamp) has be labored with his pen
to win unto his byace, and to bring her Ladyship in dislike of the secular
priests (as others have sought, but all alike prevailed, she being both too
wise, constant, and virtuous to be carried away with gloses) you would marvel
that ever any bearing the face of a religious man would write so exorbitantly
as he there has done) to his utter shame and discredit, as you shall well
perceive when it once comes forth in Print with the discovery of his
arrogance, ignorance, and lies on the one side: and of his malice, sla^derous
tongue, and contempt of the secular priests on the other side. But to return to
our former speech: These circumstances of Parsons actions and names given to
offenders, demonstrating a sovereignty or superiority in chief to be in
Master Blackwell: it follows that he being notwithstanding all this
subordinate, or (for fear or want of wit, experience and knowledge due to such
a superior: as he takes upon him to be) at the command of Fa. Garnet, betwixt
whom by a priest of their own faction, it has been told that there is
continual intercourse once in every 24. hours at least: there can no less be
aimed at by the Jesuits in this Isle, then a supreme power imperialty and
dominion over all. And so I conclude that they aim at the succession
themselves to rule under the Spaniards, or rather to cloak their intended
ambitious aspires under the Spaniards wings a while, until they have gotten
all subjected under them. Sed caveat Hispania praelio, partu, venditur proelis
fides.

THE VI. ARTICLE.
Whether? then seeing they shoot at the whole monarchy of great Britanie
together with Ireland: Do they intend any thing against France or not? Or
whether their practice for England may hinder or further their attempts for
France, more then their like practices for Scotland, one while, and for
Ireland, another while, may do or no?

THE ANSWER.
ENgland is made the maine chance of Christendom, as our countries heavy
case is at this present by seditious, factions, tampering and aspiring heads.
Wherefore we have just cause so many as love to live in quiet, to pray heartily
for the preservation of her Majesty's life. For afterward great calamities are
we sure to see, so many as live to that woeful hour by all probable
conjecture. And by consequent then it follows, that England is the only
butte, mark, and white, they aim at; as well in intention, as in execution of
their pretended expedition, exployte and action. Which failing, farewell a
Jesuits monarchy for ever. But holding their plots cast for England, then have
at all France and other nations by piece meal, in succeeding turns of
conquests. And therefore stands it both the state ecclesiastical and temporal
upon: of England in chief: of France next; and so of all other states and
princes, to look to them in time, and to join in aid, favor, and assistance
of the Seminary and secular priests in this their appeal. This conclusion
needs no further, better, nor other proof, then a relation with aduisement of
this discourse Quodlibeticall. First, for that as you may gather by the second
reason in the last Article, and perceive more at large if you read father
Parsons Dolemanian succession, he brings all his chief and strongest
arguments for intituling the Lady Infanta to the English crown from that head,
scil. for that she is the right heir of Brytaine and France, etc. Now then if
she be the heir of France and Brytaine (as in precise terms he calls her in
his Appendix) and that thereby she be entitled to our English crown, then
questionles if once she get, or (I should have said) they get possession of
this Isle in her right which they aim at in chief, their title thereunto
coming by this means, it stands with no sense that they should give over
their claim on her graces behalf to that kingdom whereof they say she is
already heir, having obtained that monarchy whereunto she is entitled by the
foresaid claim of heritage, and whereby withal reciprocally she is again
reintituled to the same French kingdom and crown. Neither will the law
Salique keep them out from aduauncing her royal ensigns in the midst of
them. For I hold it but for a kindly canuase, banding bob, or taunting effect,
to confront with France, for Burgundy, Britany, and other states and
seigniories, of old depending upon the French crown: affirming as father
Parsons does in Doleman, that though by the law Salique the Lady Infanta may be
defeated and put from her rightful title of inheritance, and lawful claim to
the whole kingdom of France, in concreto, or in sensu composito, (as a man may
term it) yet no reason says he there, but that so many states and provinces
as came to the crown of France by heirs general or women, but that the same
should diuolue unto the Spaniard by women heirs again. Which if he can bring
to pass (for all those seigniories come by women) then shall the French be so
fleeced in abstracto or in sensu diuiso, as let them rest assured, to be
distracted out of their wits ere the Spanish Jesuitical faction have left
them: unless they surrender up the whole into their hands, and yield perforce
to abrogate the authority of their Salique laws, it holding no way either in
piety or policy with father Parsons principles, that taking upon him in his
said book of titles and high counsel of reformation, to abolish utterly the
ancient municipall laws of this land, which were established by highest
authority, then the law Salique of France, and that before ever the said
law was heard of amongst them, that they should not tender, thrust upon and
compel the French, to change their form of government, laws, customs, and
all at his designement.

Secondly, although during the time of their (I mean the Jesuits) rebellious
practices and conspiracies against the last king Henry the 3. of France, of the
house of Valois, and this king regnant Henry the 4. (before king of Navarre:)
it was not directly known that the Jesuits had cast at the crown and whole
kingdom of France in those wars then maintained by aid of the Spaniard: but
as a great part of catholics here in England in former broiles and
conspiracies as well by the dukes of Norfolk, and of Guise, as also by
captain Stukeley and doctor Saunders aided with Italians, and Spaniards, etc.
and finally by the attempt in the year 1588. did think that the Jesuits and
their faction had done all of zeal (though indiscretely) and for the
advancement of Gods glory and the catholic cause pretended by them to be
religion. So the French catholics many of them of ignorance following the parts
of Spain and other rebels against their Sovereign and country by Jesuitical
persuasion, having had the like good opinion of these religious men, and
thereupon following their direction at an inche, yet since their expulsion
thence for their treasons and conspiracies, upon more wary and further looking
into their doings, drifts, and plot castings, comparing their infamous libels,
letters, passages, practices, purposes, and proceedings together, and
conferring one thing with an other, here and there, and in all other nations,
kingdoms, and provinces where they come and can get footing (as now in Sweuia
the case is clear, how the Polonian king is defeated of that kingdom,
occasionated only by their treacherous, ambitious tampring aspires) sundry of
sound judgment and of the grauer, more politic and wiser sort amongst them
that are not led away with passion or affection further then reason, law,
justice, conscience, and religion, mooues, binds and compels them for to
think: are fully persuaded they escaped as great a danger of coming under a
Iesuitical bondage, when al France was in a furious combustion by them, as ever
they or any other nation did, at what time as the Templars (the sampler of the
Jesuits often mentioned by me in sundry places) had confederated with the Turks
or Sarazens in a general conspiracy for the overthrow of the whole christian
world and of France in chief. And therefore as that most Christian and
catholic king great Henry of France now regnant has just cause together with
the state of France, never to admit of the Jesuits again to come within his
borders, or to like (as the Scots phrase goes) within his bounds: so marvel
not though all that are Jesuits either in verbo or in voto, in re or in spe, or
in faction or affection, do mightily grudge, murmur, and even gnash their teeth
in the fury of their zeal, with most bitter words, reuiling as well the Popes
holiness as the king Christian, the state, the clergy, the catholics, and the
whole realm of France, when they hear but the name of that nation, or call
to mind what a sweet morsel was taken out of their jaws, at the
reconciliation of the French king to the catholic Romish Church: as the only
act which dashed their hope for the time of that crown, frustrated their
ambitious aspires to that mighty monarchy, and put them half in despair of
ever obtaining the like means of aspiring to sovereign dominion. Yea I am
verily persuaded it gave many of the more ambitious sort amongst them such a
frantike, phanaticall, mad, distraction in their wills: as seven years retired
exercise of contemplation, will hardly bring them to a true mortified religious
course and spirit again. For had they gotten France subjected under the
Spaniards at that time, as the ticklish state of all things stood here and
elsewhere: (the Spanish title and claim to the English crown rising thence as
before is said) they would have had greater possibility of advantage, helps,
and means by size ace and the dice, for the conquest of all these northern
Isles then now they have, or are like hereafter easily to be possessed of: the
whole Christian world beginning now daily more and more to look into them and
their treacherous dealings. Thirdly, I might here enlarge my self with many
weighty reasons to convince the Jesuitical ambition and aspires to the French
crown and kingdom, as well by some suspicious speeches given our by their
fautors of the causes moving the marriage betwixt the Lady Infanta Isabella
and the Archduke Albert, and placing of them both in the Low countries: as also
by the general passages and the Jesuitical faction concerning the house of
Burgundy, and common applauses given on that behalf: how marvelous deeply
affected the Burgundians are to the English, how hateful to the French, how
worthy warriors of themselves: and how that their forces, together with the
power of England, and strength which the Lady Infanta their sovereign, would
bring or send under the conduct of some Jesuitical General, perchance of
Captain Cubbocke were sufficient to bring both France and Scotland under the
English subjection, as of right they should. These with many other the like
persuasions used by them both to catholics and others of our common
adversaries, show plain (if a man ponderate every point, particular, and
circumstance well with himself:) that the Jesuits aim at all these northern
Isles, together with the whole kingdom of France, and by consequent then
these once gotten in full possession, what kingdom in the world, but per
nullum tempus occurrens regi, may by degrees come under their bow, bondage and
Allobrogicall government.

THE VII. ARTICLE.
Whether then (because so it seems by this your last speech) do the Jesuits
(if they prevail in England or France) intend any thing against Spain and
the whole house of Austria; and by consequent against the whole Empire and all
other Monarchiall states of Christendom: or else none but only these before
mentioned to themselves, and the rest for the Spanish and Austrian lines.

THE ANSWER.
IT is most certain, apparent, and manifest by all conjecture, reasons,
proofs and arguments ad hominem: that they most traitorously have cast the
platform, and do go about so much as wit of man can devise, to bring all
kings, princes, and states in Christendom under their subjection. And
therefore they have an intendment against Spain, Austria and the whole empire,
as well as against England, Scotland or France, or any other peculiar
province, though not against all at once (for that were mere folly in them)
but by peecemeale (as I said before of these northern Isles) in setting one
nation in opposition against an other, and every one to be jealous not only of
their neighbor princes, but also of their own subjects each one apart: and
all this under pretense of religion, making the Spaniards (because he has the
best bag in deed, though they pretend because he has more religion in him
then the rest: a great many not knowing, or at least not thinking of it, how
that the Spanish state is as ticklish as any in Christendom this day, and as
much bad and wicked livers in it, as any where almost is to be found, the
number of infidels, Nueuo Christiano, and lewd catholics considered) to be the
cloak of their colorable aspires, pretending for him alone: as best able they
think to bear them out against all other princes or sovereigns whosoever. In
which kind of practice, policy and matchiuilean devise do blind the eyes of
the multitude (which they chiefly labor for) though it may seem incredible to
some that ever they should aspire to an absolute monarchy thereby: considering
they are so few in number, and those dispersed here and there in sundry Nations
over all the face almost of the whole earth: yet who so does well consider that
the Turkish empire, the Ottomans race, the Mahumetans state, has spread it
self abroad upon no expectation had either of themselves, or fear conceived
at first of any other by them (like to this platform doctrine and pretend of
the Jesuits) they will think it neither strange nor impossible; but rather
very probable, unless God do strike them and confound their devises.

And this I prove first to be so much the more probable, that they both aspire,
aim and shoot at an absolute imperial mark, and withal will be able to give
a greater assault, pushe and put for it when time comes, then ever any of the
four monarchs or other vpstart imperial states gave before them to this day:
by how much as they are more dispersed and have greater fatours in all
Christian kingdoms, then any other rebels or aspires to sovereign dominions
had, in any one of these regions where they first began tyrannically to rule.
For if Ottoman alone could pass out of Persia with other vacabonds, and in the
end become so mighty a Lord in a strange land (vanquishing in short space the
rest of his fellows, all great princes by fortune of wars and other means)
that now his successor called Imperator Turcarum, is the most powerable Emperor
of the world: yea above the Spaniards (by reason that his dominions are united
together round about him) whereas the Spaniard is rather hindered, and his
strength diminished by multitudes of kingdoms, entitled, subjected, and
governed by him, then otherwise; by reason that they lie so far a sunder
disioynted, by intercurring countries betwixt him and home on each side) then
considering what manner of men they are: none can deny but that there is great
likelyhoode of the Jesuits advancement to sovereign dominion, with enlargement
of their territories, further then ever it was like that the Turk should have
enlarged his, until the effects did demonstrate it unto the world that so it
was.

Secondly, this is confirmed not only ab inductione, for every particular
Nation, how many great potentates side with them, to second their adversaries
every where; but also by the means they have to work that feate withal,
scil. to increase their faction by winning inueigled single hearts unto them:
which they do sundry ways, but especially by three devises, that are the
chief aides and hopes of conquests, none of which the Ottomans had when they
began their enterprise. One is wit, practice, experience and policy (for in
vain are wars abroad, nisi sit consilium domi:) neither Matchiuel, nor any
that ever yet was in Europe coming near unto the Jesuits for Atheall devises
to prevent the stoppels of their stratagems, and to further their own
proceedings. An other is, pretended piety, whereby (through help of the former
to put their rules and principles in execution in due time and place,
respecting the person and other circumstances and occasions offered:) they have
and do not only allure multitudes unto them daily, increasing the number of
their faction, but withal, there can be nothing done nor almost intended
against them, or for the strengthening (by counterplots) of their adversaries
where ever they live: but presently know it, and thereby having their spials in
every princes court and place of most intelligence, that may inform their
General, as they do once a month ordinarily from all parts of Europe) what
is there done or intended with or against them; they have the advantage by
being thus dispersed to save themselves from all universal, or any notable
danger. And if possibly it can be prevented, or their adversaries overthrown
in their own courses taken against these fathers, they have the means for it,
else it is not in the world to be heard of or found. The last is, plenty of
money, which Ottoman also wanted. And seeing (to speak morally) there is not
that exploite to be done, which money cannot compass: then consider what huge
masses of money and infinite treasure the Jesuits have every where. It is
credibly reported by some reverend priests, as I told you once before; that
they lost at their expulsion out of France three millions at the least. Adding
hereunto what large collections they make yearly here in England (which is the
least they have in any other Nation, unless Scotland, etc.) where they are
resident, little or nothing at all, sometimes coming to any afflicted
Catholic (so merciless hard and cruel hearts they have) of many 1000. l.
which some one of them has reeceiued, as before is touched in part, and more
at large in other books written of their connicatching devises to get money,
is to be found. Then I say none ever had fairer means or greater helps and
likelyhoods of prevailing in their ambitious aspires, and affecting of
sovereign dominion in an absolute monarchiall state, then they have.

Thirdly, that the Jesuits practice is as well against Spain, and by
consequent against the whole house of Austria, and the Empire, as against any
other Nation: it is apparent by that I told you of in part before concerning
Fa. Parsons, winding, twinding, doubling and boutgates, in intituling the Lady
Infanta to the English crown, meaning it directly for himself and his
society; as is manifest also by his said books of succession etc. which here
you may please to confirm, as well by general collections out of the same
books, as likewise by the common report given out by him and his faction: that
not only the said king catholic was privy to the setting forth of that
luckles labor, but also patronized it: as a special work and piece of
service done on his majesty's behalf, to the greatest prejudice that could ever
have been offered to the king catholic as well ancient as recent, and now
regnant in esse. For first he makes his majesty the author, (in a sort)
patron, and protector of all the conspiracies, treasons, and treacheries that
are or can be brought against himself, or any other sovereign prince built
upon the erroneous principles and grounds there laid down, by the many wide
open gaps, made through his popular doctrine. For all rebellious multitudes in
every province, court or country living under the Spanish government or else
where: to enter and claim authority over him, if in any thing they take
pepper in the nose, by least conceited dislike: and all this under pretense of
glorious styles and titles of common wealths and states. Then he insinuates as
though the right and title as well to the crown of England as also of France
(and by consequent to the crown and kingdom of all Europe, there being not
one but his title to it, is as good if not better, then it is to England) were
wholly in his highness gift and free for him to bestow where he pleases. And
out of this gross conceit he brings for an assured assertion, for
concatenation of the catholic religion and king catholic together: as bellum
sacrum has been ever since made odious even to a Christian catholics ears:
and the Spaniard had in suspicion of all other Christian princes, that he
aspireth to a sole absolute monarchical government, despition, whereas it is
this said father and his society that aim at it in very deed. Which no
indifferent, valorous or wise man hearing of, but will think that all princes
in christendom have just cause to look hereafter to their stand, and to have
a jealous, watchful restlesst eye, as well upon the Jesuits, (and never to
trust a word they speak in commendation of the Spaniard, and discommendation
of other people or nations compared with them) as also upon the said kings,
Queens and Archduke, and Duchess, etc. When they pretend any thing either on
the catholic church or the Jesuits behalf: and by consequent shall do an
act of high merit, justice, prudence, and policy if they (I mean all other
christian princes and states) expel these seditious factions, and turbulent
irreligious persons out of all their territories, seigniories, regalties and
dominions, that have pesterd the Church of God with such wicked doctrine as the
project of that book imports. As none will judge otherwise of them, but as of
most conscienceles, careless, and bloody minded men, when they shall hear first
of one book set out (as Greenecote is) wherein the Author does manifestly
demonstrate that no different religion (be it heresy or whatsoever) ought to
deprive a lawful heir in fee simple of his fathers inheritance, being but a
subject and a forraigner; then in princes rights and titles to kingdoms, it
must and ought to hold says father Parsons in that place; bringing in sundry
examples, how that neither in England, catholics by that name were debard of
their lawful inheritance under her Majesty since the change of religion here,
neither the Puritanes in Scotland under the Queen Regent a catholic there:
neither in France, Germany, or else where, was it ever heard of, that any were
disinherited for religious causes, etc. and then again of an other (as Parsons
Doleman is together with his Appendix, Philopater and others) that quite
discard all heretics as he terms them) from all interest, pretend or title to
any crown. Noe not if in case hereafter they should be catholic at the
attempting of such an exploit, or when they should see there were no remedy.
This last conceit with these hot spirited Puritanian, Jesuitical faction is
holden so far wide and contrary to the former, as if the parties be not
catholics, ever at the instant when their fatherhoods would have them (be you
fully assured for no zeal of religion but of mere machiuilian policy, either
thereby to exasperate them against others, or others against them, and so to
bring all a flote in fire and sword, which is the only thing they long for)
they must be censured, judged, and condemned presently for reprobates,
atheists, impostors to be converted, and men (be they Princes or whosoever)
utterly of God forsaken.

This doctrine when princes and other men of learning, judgment, and
experience in such pragmatical platformes do perspicuously look into: and
withal perceive that religion is abused, and Gods holy name blasphemed (as
being not his honor but their own, under a mask of catholic zeal they wish
for) they enter further into a deep detestation of their Pharisaicall
proiects, iealously had of their own natural subjects and princely fear, of
their royal estates. When they hear a man pretend (as father Parsons does on
Spaniardes behalf) and make a claim never heard of in any age, to another
man's lands, in whose actual, quiet, and apparently rightful possession, by
lineall descent from the father to the son for many hundred years space,
times and ages past, it having continued: is now diuoluted to the present
incumbent, or prince regnant from his auncesters, whose state, title, and
regal honor he has, possesses, and peaceably enjoys: that so ancient
renowned, indubitate a right should now be called in question, and that upon
the bare word of a claymorous claim, exceeding al mean, modesty and measure
made by an arrant traitor, to God, his Prince, his country, and to all laws
of God, of nature, of nations, or of man: and generally misliked of by all
grave, discreet, prudent, learned, wise, religious, true hearted catholics,
especially for this his sudden camelion, unexpected, undeserved, ungrounded,
exorbitant, passionate apostrophall change, of a foisted in pretend;
audaciously presuming (without bulls, breue, billet, ticket, word or warrant of
any authority) to charge all men to allow, admit, ratify and confirm without
all gainesay, controlment, or contradiction; such a Sovereign as he the said
father Parsons will appoint them: otherwise to be noted for Atheistes, fools,
rebels, malicious politikes, and adverse to his catholic Majesty, and
(forsooth) the common cause: this, this is that most odious, scandalous,
irreligious, treacherous, and erroneous doctrine, which is so prejudicial to
the king catholic and his pretended cause: as whiles Spain is Spain,
England, England, France, France, and Rome, Rome, will it never be forgotten
nor forgiven, nor the jealousy thereof put out of all princes hearts. So as
justly father Parsons may be pointed at for worse then a fabling libeller: and
were worthy were he not a priest, to be set upon the pillorie, and that even
by his catholic Majesty; for bearing the world in hand that he was set on, to
write those libels by warrant and priuitie of the said surmised pretendor:
whereas all circumstances both in the same books and scheduls, together with
those plotcasters speeches in secret to their friends, and the many dangers,
damages, indignities and discommodities accrewing to the king and his royal
estate: do argue quite contrary. This is that venomous law, will pearce the
king catholic to the very naked heart, if his Majesty permit it to pass
current without due punishment inflicted upon the presumant scribe: and speedy
abolishment of so polypragmaticall a platform; no less dangerously cast, then
traitorously laid to entrap all princes in Christendom in a Templars snare:
and as prejudicial (if not more) in chief to the crown and safety of his
royal person, to his family in esse, and to his successors for ever hereafter;
as to any other prince or monarch whosoever. For let his Highness wink at this
doctrine and seem to authorize it: and then what better warrant or more
plausible can be devised (when minds of people in all nations as ruefull
experience does tell us, are now a days so quickly exulcerated with grievous
sores of gustes and discontent easily corrupted with maladies of contention,
and hastily set on horseback with superfluous humors of novelties,
innouations, ambition, disdain, revenge, thirsting after blood, desirous of
liberty, and greedily affecting sovereignty:) then thus to authorize all and
every Province under his government to rebel against him at their pleasure:
and auouche, maintain, and defend for lawful, all their outrageous
insurrections, malepert mutinies, and contagious crimes, against his highness
and soundest part of his nobles and subjects every where, but especially in the
Low countries under this counterfeited conference holden at Amsterdam amongst
the States there.

Yea by this colorable doctrine of Fa. Parsons hotch potch, prodigious common
wealths authority, when it comes to reasoning (standing the premises without
the kings controlment:) they may lawfully auerre al their practices,
proceedings and deeds past: they may admit his majesty peacebly to govern and
reign over them with this condition that he shall mantaine the course by them
begun for government, and allow of all their profane and irreligious orders
set down for succession, as to be let in and put out at their pleasure. And
thus under a cloak of a most shamfull heathnish Turkish and ridiculous common
wealths authority (never seen, nor heard, nor liked, nor allowed of by God or
man) the king regnant should be as the term goes to day a man to morrow none.
Now a king crowned at twelve a clock at noonetyde, and presently disinuested of
all his roabes of estate and uncrowned again by prime if it so pleased the
mock majesty of the multitude: at the kings royal approach to the imperial
throne of regalitie, he shall have the title in words of a king monarchiall
with viuat rex in aeternum, but like a king of clowts ere ever he take regal
state upon him, he shall hear a proclamation from a Democracy, with penes nos
respublica regimen and imperium: if the said state popular be strong enough to
bear away the style and title of a colorable weal public. And thus per
circulum, one king displaced after an other, none being sure of his state, but
remoueable by law at the good will and pleasure of the mobile vulgus, as
mutable as the weathercocke: the Spanish majesty, and Archgrace of Austria
(being once in possession of the English, French, and Scots crowns) must
depend upon the exorbitant, inconstant, passionate wills of their own unruly
vassals to be expeld the next day after: if either he displease, or an other
better conceit them in their rusticke, rude, ruffling humors. And so one
after an other must be placed, or displaced, as these common wealths humorists
fancy best. To whom (as Master Charles Paget has well noted) king Philip must
obey like a poor lacky in a French Ioupe, to run and turn, sit, and stand,
reign, and render, accept and abjure his crown and kingdom, regality and
all, as a subject, servant, and poor vassal at their appointment, and right
served by his own acceptance and allowance of a Law and legifer so
contemptible, disgraceful, and prejudicial to the sacred majesty of a King.

But questionless, if either his late majesty, or present king regnant, had
understood our English idiome or been truly informed of the contents of those
his worthless works, or had known what absurdities, contradictions, and
spiteful preiudices, had lien close cowched betwixt the bark and tree, the
root, and the rind, the superficial show in words, and real proceedings in
acts, of father Parsons and his confederates bewitching both his and our
Sovereigns loyal subjects (together with all the populars of every Prince in
Christendom) with this his most dangerous, irreligious, wretched, and
rebellious doctrine, made for his own purpose, under a flattering dissimulate
pretense, of aduauncing his majesty's title to that he has no right unto: and
thereby to bring both him and all other Princes in subjection to these popular
state conspirators, for their own ancient, just, and lawful inheritance: he
would sure have rejected him with heue, and ho, in a strappado: unless that
his priesthood might happily have saved him at a pinch of extremity. But yet
his majesty may perhaps cast him into the Inquisition, and cause him to be
degraded, eraced, and burnt for an heretic, if he obstinately maintain what
he has begun: but that is the spite of it, a Jesuit will stand to nothing,
though there be a thousand witnesses of it) when his books and libels shall
come in print for these matters, translated into Latin or Spanish, with
perfect annotations of that corrupt text of his, taken out of his own, and his
confederates works against himself, for better information of his highness,
and the sacred Inquisition of many blasphemies, foul abuses, and gross
errors. As first affirming as erst I told you: how that all succession
government, and governors or whatsoever is included or depends upon the law
divine and of nature, is all one without possibility of alteration or change:
as God and nature (says he) are common and one to all alike, etc. He thereby
covertly by a fallacy denies free will in man, putting no difference betwixt
the laws of nature general, and specificall: or that law which is common to
man, together with brute beasts, and that other which is proper to man alone.
Which latter (as that whereupon only this government depends) he must grant
to be naturally subject to alteration and change, as the former is tied to
immutability and permanent continuance in one and the self same state. Then
hereupon follows an other absurdity scil. a king says he in plain terms
holds his crown, regality, and kingdom, by the goodwill of the common
wealth his vassals where he reigns. Again, an other absurdity or grosser
error may be this: that he affirms this common wealth (which he avouches to
control regal majesty in form above recited to place, and displace, kings
and subjects at their pleasure) has to challendge this privilege unto it:
that it is commanded by the holy Ghost in such sort as that in sentence
judicial it cannot err. And by consequent I infer first; that he means
absolutely of a Jesuitical common wealth squared, agreeing to the high
Counsel of Reformation. (For never could I hear any other state, court, or
association that they would honor so much as to give out they could not err,
save only themselves and their society, etc.) And then again: that this
supposed of a Iesuitical common wealth scil. Quod respublica non potest errare:
it follows that rebles and traitors may hereupon build what the list, and
bring in the great Turk, or Came, of Catay, to rule over us without
controlement. And this brings in an other contradiction. For whereas in one
place he holds that titles to kingdoms of Princes once settled are not to be
examined, but absolutely obeyed, by private men: in an other place quite
contrary, he presumes upon his own head to examine titles of the greatest
monarchs on earth, and to determine them by way of consultation in a public
conference of a wine tavern authority. And because vno absurdo dato plura
sequuntur: therefore to make show that this conference was by authority not of
private but of public persons: therefore must every wayfaring man and
traveler, tinker and pedlar, rogue and runnagate, tag and rag that is a member
of father Parsons common wealth, more exorbitant then his former (called of
many the Earl of Leicesters common wealth or Greencote) must be a public
person, and not daily and howerly carried away in private from his own opinion:
nor yet examine the matter privately, before or after he come to confer
thereof with this grave father, we may be sure and the rest of the Jesuits
appointed for that purpose: Just like to this legifers law given to his
vicegerent the Archpriest, to cut off all meetings or conferences to be had
amongst secular priests about his authority. And a very like law or rather
abuse of all law and order, is his tyrannical course taken amongst the
English students at Rome, that they may not have their mutual meetings,
congratulations, recreations, and other solaces and comforts of one chamber,
class, and company with another, as erst they have had, and is every where
else to be found, where any humanity, religious piety, or charitable wish or
desire of either spiritual welfare, or corporal health, progress and
practice of study, virtue and learning is resident in the Rector, Principal
or chief. But Jesuits must needs smell of innouations and singularity in all
things: otherwise how should we know their rare indowments, illuminations, and
familiar acquaintance with their maker etc.

And to this absurdity a blasphemy of his may be added, wherein he makes
this opposition against the sacred state of regal dignity and throne
triumphant of imperial majesty: to wit, that the title, honor, and regal
dignity of a crown, is of all other things so irregular and extraordinary,
as not only an usurper, disseizer, intruder, and impious tyrant, but also even
a very infidel, a traitor, a butcherly murderer, or a most base Assismistial
crew; if once he may attain it by the rules of father Parsons common wealth:
then his title is never after to be examined by any (except a Jesuit, you must
always understand) but every one is bound (as is above said) in conscience to
obey the same.

Lo here noble princes and you dear catholics, what you are to learn out of
the Jesuitical doctrine. Certainly therein is nothing else but fallacy upon
fallacy, error upon error, one contradiction encountering another, and all
nothing but treacheries, treasons and conspiracies. The state of a monarchy is
of all other governments the most perfect and excellent: and yet forsooth the
tenure of a crown is imperfect, infamous, as out of all rule and order. The
actual possession of a kingdom or state at the first usurpation of it, must
only guide the right as the most material point to lead the inheritance and
succession of a crown which way it likes best. The common wealth is the only
judge of the possessionar or king regnant to control him at the pleasure of
the people. A king was made to rule a common wealth, and a common wealth to
obey a king: and yet carts must lead carthorses, scholars guide
schoolemasters, people teach preachers, children rule parents, and an unruly
irregular disordered, multitude witkout head, or of many heads, (none good)
like a monster, cloaked by a fallacy to abuse simple people under the name of
a common wealth, must govern the most irregular and extraordinary crown. And
so laws must be construed conformable to the sensual appetite of a multitude:
and not the multitude reformed agreeable to Gods laws. Sovereigns must
accommodate themselves to the manners and conditions of their subjects, be they
good or bad: and not subjects apply themselves to the arbitrament of their
sovereigns be they never so good and gracious, longer then they list to obey
them. Sovereigns must reign upon sufferance only de facto ad beneplacitum
populi, in a bare possession of a crown: but not de iure to continue the same
by order of law in his own right, longer or otherwise then the varieties of
humors altering the dispositions in men, may move the people to interpret the
law from time to time unto them.

Thus shall neither the king catholic, nor the emperor, nor any other
sovereign have assurance of safety for their person or state one minute of an
hour; and all by this unchristian directorie of father Parsons: which makes
all their actions good and allowable to displace princes at their pleasure. And
yet still vice must be virtue, violence made law, wrongs judged rights, hangmen
made judges, and traitors crowned kings: but deposible always and actually
oftentimes must be deposed, be there cause or no cause; be they capable or
incapable; be it in the field of war, or in the land of peace. Because
(forsooth) Fa. Parsons public state or statisticall doctrine of runnagates
(called here a Common wealth) does hold it necessary to be so: and is the only
judge peramount in all state cases and commissions for a crown, king, and
kingdom without appeal to any higher judge whosoever. And further every
Precopite Tartarian multitude, thus incorporated getting once the style and
title of a public state, in their own opinion, may brook the name of a
Geneuian, or an Heluetian, or a Switherly common wealth: and alter, change,
and innouate the course of inheritance and succession, not only to crowns and
kingdoms, but also to every private persons heritage holden in Fee simple. So
as they may bear away the right and true title cast upon any from the king to
the Freeholder by the laws of Fa. Parsons new common wealth; and give it to
whom they list though the party be neither member of that state, nor subject
thereunto by nature, submission, infranchisment or other ordinary and lawful
means. For if the only lawful and good tenure of a kingdom, diadem, and
crown be holden by the king himself of the goodwill only of the common
wealth, that is as much to say as a Tenant at will of the people: then
follows it by this hyperbolical fiction against the state of inheritance in
regal majesty, that a fortiori, all a sovereigns subjects also which have
any lands of ancient demaine or other inheritance must be subject to the like
laws. And so by good or at least necessary sequel is inferd, that this they
do to confront the king of Spain in chief points of regal state: and to
harden the Hollanders, Zelanders and others, there to mantaine wars in open
action against him: as also to minister new matter of rebellion in Arragon, in
Portugal, and in all other of his own dominions, for a seditious route to
thrust him quite out of his whole monarchiall estate of Spain, and to deprive
him of kingdom, crown, and life at their pleasure. To all this Fa. Parsons
has prepared a ready way to serve his own turn and his societies, not the
king nor any of his royal issues therewith* for his admittance to the
Spaniards (much more to any other) kingdom, being only by his common wealth
and popular applauses never so well settled: yet holding his crown but as
Tenant at will of the said common wealth, who may revoke their admittance when
they list to quarrel: it follows that he has no estate of, nor assurance at
all in him, for any thing he holds.

Thus has this great Statist discovered at unawares his own, and his
confederates ambitious aspires, treacherous intent, Atheall expectation,
pragmaticall practice, and Matchiuilian platform to make the world believe he
pleads only for the Spaniards, and that simply and plainly for religions
sake: when his drift directly is (immediately by means of conquest intended
for England) to bring all Christendom into an uproar for common soldiers to
examine their sovereigns what title they hold by: and thereupon themselves by
craft, money, and multitudes gathered together through their Atheall policy,
bring Spain and all the rest under their subjection. Which apparent intendment
plots and practices with other like weighty considerations, if the late king
had lived: would have been a sufficient warning to him for ever, being abused
by any Jesuit again. And happily when this king regnant, and his sister the
Lady Infanta shall know thus much, and much more then here is said: it will
breed the same effect in their princely heads, as a fit mean to cut off these
turbulent state tamperers, and no less ambitious aspirers, then ungrateful
maligners of those princes, that have backed, advanced, and defended them most.
And either hereafter force them in Spain and in all other countries to avoid
princes courts, and medlings with nobles or the state where they live: and so
retire themselves to their cloisters as religious men should do, and as all do
but they only who despise all order; or else set them packing out of this
Christian world amongst the Antipodes, Indians, and other people to us here
unknown. For so long as they stay uncontrolled as they are, the church of God
will never be in quiet nor suffered to live vnuexed by them.

THE VIII. ARTICLE.
Whether then (seeing it seems the Jesuits aspire to the whole and absolute
monarchy of the world) have they any intent or meaning to put in for a
supremacy, and so to thrust out the Popes holiness; or have they no such
intended practices amongst them?

THE ANSWER.
IF the question had been whether ever any possibility or intendment were by
them to get a Jesuit to be Pope or no: the answer had been more ready then
it is to the former interrogatory. For that the general jealousy which most
of that sacred consistory have of the Jesuits pride, ambition, and greedy
affectation of a supremacy: has been cause that of late (as some do say) there
is an order taken that no Jesuits shall ever be admitted hereafter to be Card at
least not in that authority as some of them have been in, least they work some
crafty means to get to that worthy dignity as in tract of time they may bring
it about to have him Pope by that means: and then questionless have at all
Christendom for both states ecclesiastical and temporal. Which to make
apparent, that they aim at no less (and by consequent that, as there was but
one only Jesus who was high priest and king in the Hebrews Monarchiall Empire
or kingdom of the Jews with his twelve Apostles and the rest of his disciples
substituted under him: so in their intended platform but one Jesuit Pope and
prince Monarchiall (like a presbyter John) in the kingdom and monarchy of the
whole Christian world, with the fathers and lay brothers of his society
substituted in every country, region and province under him. Although by
relection of what has been already said there may enough be gathered
sufficient to confirm and demonstrate it against them: especially if we
confer our English Jesuitical practices and proceedings, with others of
other nations: yet in my opinion there is no one thing that discouers their
ambitious aspire more herein, then father Parsons Doleman in his peremptory
censure of all impugners of his Jesuitical or popular title (for call it no
more his Spanish title hereafter, seeing he fisheth wholly for his own
society, in as high prejudice to the Spaniards Majesty as to any other) to
the English crown. For having as I have said before authorized his subject
Master Blackwell with so ample immunities, privileges, preheminences, and
substitutiue jurisdiction, as neither pope nor prince, nor any power or
authority (unless Jesuitical) on earth may (as it seems by shrewd
suspicion had of their speech and insinuation given by their actions) have to
do with him, nor any in England, Scotland or Wales appeal from him: now by
perusing that Quodlibet of plots by authority, and conferring the same with
this of succession, you shall find here the doctrinal decrees intended of that
which there is set down to have already begun to be in practice. Thus then, he
(I mean father Parsons) teaches in his said book of titles and other
manuscripts: First, that all men living under the Spanish allegiance are bound
to take notice of their kings rightful title, interest and claim to the
English crown etc.

Secondly, that the English our countrymen, though of another nation and no way
subject to Spain at any time since the world began, were obliged to
acknowledge and subscribe (and as some have informed us, to swear) unto the
rightful succession of the Lady Infanta.

Thirdly, every one (be he foreign or home borne subject) are prohibited in
express words, by the king there (says this good father) and by an inhibition
sent from the Archpriest here to show their reasonable censure, or to deliver
their opinion and conceit touching the contents of the foresaid books and
writings, under pain of incurring the churches curse and his majesty's high
displeasure etc.

In these three positions (that I may omit sundry others, whereof he rankly
smells of heretical and rebellious doctrine to the Sea apostolic) you may
please to note what he takes upon him, and then compare, confer, and quote the
places in the first part of his Doleman making for this purpose: and you shall
find that he arrogates to himself more then Apostolical power, so as what to
make of him for my part I know not, unless an Antesignane or immediate
forerunner of Antichrist: for he taking upon him authority above the Pope in
this point of succession, so far as he would seem to make his bloody
proiects for performance thereof in a settled conceit, as infringible (if not
more) as if they were matters of faith desined by a sacred aecumenicall synod:
what this his doctrine and threats in compelling to believe and embrace it will
breed in time, or what it is, that he thereby shootes at vos iudicate. Only
two things I will say: first, that a great many and those (some of them at
least) no fools nor babies are mightily mistaken in their censure, judgment,
and opinion had of his intended platform therein: another is, that whatsoever
his intent or meaning is or was for that matter: yet has he by that book and
others very suspitiously prejudiced the Sea apostolic, and the popes holiness
in chief: whose office he having peremptorily forestalled, usurped, and
preoccupated herein, he is to be noted of high ambition, great presumption,
saucy disobedience, and what else you may guess besides) to the Roman See as
his chief superior: without whose warrant, grant and authority, he has
audaciously presumed to overthrow states, to make new kings, to form common
wealths, and to frame laws out of his own brainesicke fancy: as though he
were Monos, supreme, sovereign and superior in chief under God (if not equal)
upon whom, Pope, prince, peer and all persons of what degree, calling, or
quality soever they be, are to depend: and from whom al officers, magistrates,
powers and dominations are to receive, take and accept of for their practice
and directions in all causes martial, monastical, spiritual and temporal.

This gross error of father Parsons, and his no less great absurdity then
rash, foolish, presumptuous, and most dangerous course, where unto his proiects
do tend by this his pretense for the Lady Infanta, to color his own and his
societies traitorous aspires: do argue his insolency and pride to be, so
great as they blind his judgment, sense and censure from discerning that these
his plots, drifts and devises, will be not only condemned and laughed at by a
general applause; but he also utterly rejected and cast off, out of all
indifferent men's conceits (be they of what religion soever) that bear any
love to their country: or that wish a preservation of their ancient nobility
and gentry, freed by laws, customs, and privileges from that tyranny and
spoil which this hard natured and most cruel hearted man seems most to
desire for his own private respects and commodities.

And surely when I remember the words of some of his proctors, apparators,
somners, pursiuants, attorneys, advocates, soliciters, and serieants here in
England that neither could neither can yet endure to here that the Popes
holiness should have any dealing or meddling in this matter (as a gust which
gauleth them to the very guts to hear and see some already of a more gracious,
sweet and mild incline to mercy in her Majesty toward the innocent on that
behalf then heretofore has been, or then they can hope for to themselves or
any way (indeed) do desire to any others, father Parsons and the rest of his
state compartners urging nothing more then to have persecution of catholics
increased not diminished at all) further then to grant out bulls of
excommunication against all those that should impugn the spanish title: and
withal to send out pardons and grains of indulgence, to all those that should
fight on the Spaniards side against their native country (both which
unnatural practices, seeing the Jesuits have sought for to be put in execution
to the uttermost thereby to torment us on every side, and by consequent incense
the so oppressed with rage, against their sovereign and the state: tell me
dear catholics what moves you to fawn upon those that thus do labor for
your heavy destruction) I cannot but muse with my self, how ever this
disguised unfortunate stepfather father Parsons (being filius terrae by birth,
an Englishman, by education a catholic by external profession, a priest by
charecter, a religious man by vow and order: and taking upon him by function
and calling wholly to advance Gods cause, yea with hallowes and how-hubs, with
whowbes, whowes, and outcries against all that taste not on the froth of his
zeal) has hitherto refused to take his holiness for an example and his
sacred predecessors (the successors of Saint Peter upon whom he ought chiefly
to have relied as a special note of so sound a catholic and perfect religious
person as he, and his, would make the simple people believe they are) for a
pattern to imitate, who have ever held most mild, modest, and moderate courses
toward all: but especially toward the kings of great Britain: (were they
Scots or English) not half so severe against any; as oftentimes by
surreptitiall suggestions of some evil and factious persons they were urged to
have been. As well appeered in the bull of Pius the fifth, which though we wish
had never come out; and much more that the other two since that time denounced
against her Majesty, had never been seen or heard of in this world: yet to
speak Gods truth when the Pope his holiness perceived what bloody tragedies
and massacres on all sides, were like to ensue thereupon by command of
withdrawing our natural allegiance, from our native sovereign upon wrong
information given (as before we have touched at large) the said Bull was called
in again and all catholics throughout England left as free to obey her
Majesty in all things due to her princely regalitie as they were before. But
letting that and other excommunications pass (as spoken of before with hearty
wish they had never been) amongst many examples of the dear love and fatherly
compassion of the Popes holiness toward the inhabitants and princes of this
land in times of eminent common welthes dangers: the chief since the Norman
conquest was showed in the days and reigns of king Henry the second surnamed
Fitzempresse and of his son king John the third Monarche of England of a
Plantagenets royal race. Against whom having used his fatherly correction (as
pastor universal over the whole flock of Christ) for their great tyranny and
cruelty used toward their natural subjects: yet upon their repentance
mercifully receiving them into grace and favor of Gods church again; his
holiness on the behalf of the second, did not only accurse and excommunicate
prince Lewis of France with all his adherents: forcing him to yield up all the
interest right and title, that he or his posterity had or ever should have to
the English crown: but also surrendered up the said crown of England frank and
free to king John and his heirs and successors from of the head of Cardinal
Pandulphus (having sit enthronized three days therewith in the Popes right of
purpose to abate and end the strife) for ever to enjoy the same in as full
absolute and ample manner as any prince or monarche ever enjoyed, or possessed
a crown. And thousands there are in England that desire as much: and I verily
think more unfeignedly and with a better, more sincere, true and catholic
religious mind then any of the Jesuitical or spanish faction do desire the
conversion of our country: who yet will be ready to lay their lives to pledge
for it, that if (as God forbid and I hope it shall never happen, that any
Lancastrian forraigner should get possession of this land: with as many oaths,
homages, and fealties made and done unto him or her whosoever, as prince Lewis
had: whom father Parsons brings in for an example in confirmation of the Lady
Infantaes title by that house, blood and line of king Lewis of France, be like
of purpose to urge the English as he has to make the like protestation on the
said Infantaes behalf) yet would even this Pope Clement the eight according to
his predecessors example revoke, recall, repeal and force him or her to
retire: and withal would of his mere mercy (a gift appropriated to Saint
Peter's chair in special manner) grant to our nation, the election, and choice
and set up a king of our own native soil, bred and borne within the confines
of great Britains Ocean upon the like repentance and submission of former
princes in this and all other Christian kingdoms, maugre all the Jesuits
Spaniards and huff muffes in the world.

These important considerations should have touched father Parsons heart with
deep remorse to remember: how mightily he has resisted, impugned, and
violated all laws, divine, and humane whatsoever: how injuriously he has
dealt against his native Prince, country catholic, and all his friends: and
how prejudicial he has been in his proiects, principles, and practices,
against the Sea Apostolic, and S. Peter, by his audacious refusal, to take
his holiness for a pattern and sampler to imitate, in these his so weighty,
eminent, difficult, and dangerous proceedings: He being but a poor silly
impotent private man, forbibden latenter even by his order, by his function, by
his priesthood, by his profession, by his religion, by his calling: to urge or
use any passionate, violent, exasperating, furious course against his Prince
and country: quite contrary to his holiness direction, mind, and commission
given unto him. Who most agreeable to the practice of the tressacred
Apostolical catholic Roman Church, as most wise, sweet, and truly
compassionate loving mother, has ever esteemed it the best, safest, and
readiest way to draw and gain such Princes, and common wealths, as are gone
astray, to the right and true religion, by sacrifice, prayer, teaching,
preaching, good example giving, and that above all, of obedience to their
sovereigns and civil magistrates in points of due right belonging to them in
such cases: yea and patiently to suffer their own blood to be shed, agreeing
to the Apostolical rule, for conversion of countries, rather then once to lift
up their eyes with discontent, or set down their pen to paper in their
passions, to suffer a flying thought of revenge, to take repose upon the
buttresse of their breast, or once to go about to tamper with state and
temporize with Princes in temporal affairs. Which seeing he and his society
have not only plunged themselves in over head and ears: but also he (this
father Parsons) winding himself out of the dangers, has set all in an uproar,
by his seditious courses: and not content therewith, has labored by his
preposterous agents to cast all the whole load, burden, and bundell on our
backs, with most extreme obloquie, diffamation, and disgraces, that would not
yield a free consent to his turbulent factions, and dangerous stepe eminent
down falls in conspiracies: Neither thinking this enough, but as a lunatike,
or one raging in his affectate sovereignty, laying about him like Will Summers
on all sides, opposing himself together with his confederates against Pope,
Prelate, and priest: against Prince, peer, and subject: and against all that
are not Jesuits, without al respect had of any that crosses his designments
in the way: this then being so (as too too true it is) can any man that has
either true charity, or other virtue, learning, religion, wit, worship, worth,
or valor of spirit in him, but see what it is he aymeth at, detest him as an
egregious hypocrite, dissembling Pharisie, sly soul murdering parasite: In
pugna vi and armis dentibus, and ensibus, and vsque ad aras, all his false
positions, forgeries, and foysted in authorities, and make it known to all the
world, that he, and his society do most greedily affect sovereignty, most
traitorously aspire to an absolute monarchy: most ambitiously aim at a
supremacy, and most treacherously delude both Pope, Prince, and people, with a
seeming kind of zeal, religion, and holiness, to bring all in subjection
under them.

THE IX. ARTICLE.
Whether: seeing the Jesuits aim not (as it seems) at a sole temporal
monarchy such as Nabuchodonozer, as Cyrus, as Alexander, as Caesar atchiued
and attained unto: but such a monarchy as Adam by creation, as Noe by
preservation: as Christ himself by reparation or restoring of mankind to his
first right, obtained, possessed, and enjoyed, joining in one person that the
two chief divine attributes mercy and justice: the former, proper to a priest:
the latter, to a prince: and so by consequent their intended government
including in it (as these three, Adams, Noes, and Jesus Christ did) the whole
and absolute jurisdiction, power and authority monarchiall of priesthood and
princedome over the whole world: Is there then any intent in the Jesuits
platform of any such government, as may bear the name and title of a
monarchy indeed? or intend they a Democracy, nor an Aristocracy, or an
Ologarcy? or what kind of government is intended by them?

THE ANSWER.
I Am of opinion that no man on earth can tell what government it is, they
intend to establish, ratify and confirm: when they come to their preconceited
monarchy: No not any of their plotcasters, be it the exlegall legifer Fa.
Parsons can tell before hand what government he will have and continue withal.
For considering that he intends to alter and change all laws, customs and
orders (which make me often remember some men's strange conceits, that he should
either beget, or immediately procure Antichrist) it cannot be; but that the
popularity he now so greatly in covert wise commends, will break out upon
one occasion or other (ere ever he be settled or well warmed in his kingdom)
into some open rebellion against him, otherwise should such a rabble loose the
name of Mobile vulgus. And further admit that his providence, fore cast and
foresight were such, as even in the establishing of the Jesuitical state,
there should be such governors (as lay brothers of the society) appointed at
the sack of every city, winning of every hold, fort or sluice, and conquest of
every kingdom, country or province, as by their marshiall prowes combinde
with civil policy might keep them all in order subordinately one under
another: and all under their Generall-Pope-monarchiall-sole Emperor over the
whole world: yet considering the extreme ambition of that kind of people, as
before has been passantly touched here and there (especially noted in the
brabling contentions betwixt the two great emperors Fa. Parsons and Fa.
Heywood) this order whatsoever it shall be, or how orderly soever observed for
the whole, until they have gotten that into their hands, they all do gape
after. No question but it will break off in short time, and that they shall be
forced to alter, change, and make new laws again. And this being fitly
agreeing to a principle of their own, set down by M. Paget as he has
observed in them, scil. Omnia pro tempore, nihil pro veritate: no question of
it, but their government shall be as uncertain as their new conceited
monarchy, their monarchy as mutable as their reign, and their reign as
variable as the weathercocke in the wind: or Protheus in his Complements: or
the sea Euripus in his cross tide ebbes and flows, who for his in constancy
has not of old been holden for more infamous then Fa. Parsons for the like
offense is justly judged and accounted as most monstrous in our days.

But to answer directy to the Article proposed, no question is to be made of
it, but that the government they do directly intend at this present, is a most
absolute sovereignty, dominion and state clearly exempted from subordination
to any law or legifer divine or humane: and therefore it is rightly called
Despoticon in the highest degree of exemption, immunitie, imperialtie, and
absolute reign, rule, and authority, as containing in it all three sorts of
government, scil. Monarchical, Aristocraticall, Democraticall in matters of
counsel and managing of common wealths causes, but not in points of regaltie,
honor, and inheritance. For there shall be neither title, nor name, nor honor
given taken or done to any Prince, Duke, Marquess, Earl, Vicount, Lord,
Baron, or the like (all the Jesuitical governors being puritan like, seniours,
elders, prouincials, rectors, ministers, etc.) neither shall there be any
succession by birth or blood, to any honor office or magistracy from the
monarch Pater General to the minor Pater minister, but all shall go by
election and choice: neither shall any title, claim or right of inheritance be
made, challenged, pretended, intended or diuolued from the father to to son:
but all shall rest in this Presbyter John or Pope-Monarchiall-Generals gift. No
noble, knight, Esquier, or swayne possessing more then the monarch shall bestow
upon him, as tenant at will for the time, nor for term of life, just like to
the Turks distribution of lands and honors. And if any think that this is but
a surmise, let them reperuse what here passantly is written in these
Quodlibets, and confer (if possibly they can get them) Fa. Parsons books of
titles together with his high counsel of Reformation, and other passages in
manuscripts, and then doubtless they will be of my mind.

THE X. ARTICLE.
Whether then (seeing their intended government is most Antichristian,
Tartarian, Turcicall and Tyrannical) do they maintain this their paradoxall,
pragmaticall, and stratagemicall doctrine by any law, revelation or other
authority, save only their own bare word, will and command to have it so? or
what is the ground of all these their strange courses?

THE ANSWER.
STabat pro ratione voluntas: was the chief ground of the disciplinary law:
why poor Todde was beaten in Rome until his bones aked: knowing no cause in
the world for the Jesuits to have used him so. And if any seem so peremptory
as to ask a Jesuit what authority he has either concerning these or any
other exorbitant, extrauagant, exlegall, and extra ordinary laws, rules,
customs or orders set down, observed and kept amongst them: let him look for
none other but a thunderbolt of excommunication, or sharp censure irremissibly
to be thrown against him: they being such Lords, lawless Sirs, and legifers,
as cannot err in any act, word or thought of a matter, of fact to be formed,
framed and fashioned by them: and therefore high blasphemy to contradict these
Demigods in any thing. But if you ask them why such a law, doctrine or order
is set down by way of submission, admiration, or humble acknowledgement of
their powerable dignity and woorthines above all other persons living on
earth: then to breed a greater reverence, dutiful regard, and respective
fear in you toward them: they may happily tell you, that they have it by
revelation: that as by special commandment from God their order or society
was miraculously instituted for this end; so father Parsons was and is the
prophet appointed to prophecy unto us a dismal change: that the time is come
wherein all laws, customs and orders must be altered, and all things turned
vpside down: and that they being the only men that have the name, office and
authority of Jesus: by them it is that this marvelous change and alteration
shall be wrought, in such sort as from the beginning of the world was the like
never heard of before to this present, of the Jesuits precedencie. Mary yet if
you ask other men dispassionate, impartial and not speaking of affection, by
what law or authority they do attempt and teach these things; they will tell
you, they have neither law divine nor humane so to do, but a law irregular
made by an exlegall legifer father Parsons by name, who has prejudiced,
iniuried, and wronged by his infamous libels, all laws and lawyers customs,
states and orders. For first he has prejudiced the laws, common, pontifical,
of nations, of nature, and of God himself: as in the premises of sundry
precedent Quodlibets may appear. Then he has prejudiced the laws municipiall
of this noble Isle, laboring to foist in, to outward show the laws civil
Roman, of Caesar abolished above a thousand years ago, by authority of the Sea apostolic at the instant suit of king Lucius with the general consent of
all his noble Lords, the worthy Britains then peers of these two realms. He
has abused the law, custom, and order observed in humanity, in fawning upon
the Austrian line, under pretense to bring in the imperial laws of Caesar
into this land: but intending in very deed to thrust a law upon us never heard
of before throughout the universal world, nor I think ever shall be put in
execution until the coming of Antichrist, that all run upon wheels with
alteration and change. He has prejudiced the law of property in instituting
government, governors, and hereditarie princes to be ad beneplacitum populi,
and all other private possessiants ad beneplacitum suum. He has prejudiced the
laws civil and imperial of Caesar bringing them in falsely alleged; and one
thing for another as a comment for a corpse, a code for a digest, a gloss for a
text, a memorial for a principle, and a note of some allegation upon a suit
past on the behalf of a client, for a maxim in the laws, either
vnauthentically defined, or remaining litigious, pliable to any opinion, or
else interpreted as father Parsons pleases, to the most disgrace he can devise
to all Ciuilians, applied by him against proximitie of blood, to breed a
divorce of friendship and kindred, by disturbing the lawful course of
succession by birth and consanguinitie provided by laws, for passage of lands
and inheritance after the law of property began in all nations. Which violent
intrusion of Caesar's laws thus abused and bolsterd out, to the utter ruin of
many noble families irreuocably: he has no shift to ratify and get it allowed
of, but to delude simple people, to confirm it by sundry examples of banckrupt
common wealths or rather disordered multitudes. He has abused and prejudiced
all states, common wealths, nobles and gentiles, of this and all other
Christian nations, by a temporized popularitie, thrust in upon them:
accomodating himself (as he says) to the conditions, manners, and minds of
the common people, which ever do delight in novelty and change. Otherwise (as
he seriously noted) had the Jesuits never been so admired at, in England as
they are at this day. But omnia rara sunt preclara amongst the mobile vulgus
who seizing quickly upon this popular doctrine: it presently imprinted a
favorable opinion and liking both of the man and the matter in their wavering
hearts: as all the world sees it: and perceiving they might by this popular
doctrine of father Parsons, control, disthronize, and overthrow their
sovereign, the state, their landlords, and all other nobles and gentiles as
they listed and liked best: hereupon then they inferd very peremptorily that
when they list they might pick a quarrel at their lawful king, cast him down
out of his throne and call for an election of a new king again. Because
(forsooth) this good father has authorized them so to do, and tells them that
as his, so their pleasure must stand for a law, and vox populi. vox Dei. And
for any other law warrant or authority the Jesuits have none to take upon
them as they do in these state cases and succession to princes crowns.

THE GENERAL ARGUMENT OF THE TENTH AND LAST QVODLIBET.
IN the argument of the ninth general Quodlibet we noted unto you how that the
same together with this, had their dependency upon the seventh, and eight
precedent, and so one depending upon an other in this disputatiue pursuit,
having reuersed, retriued, and firrited these religious statesmen out of all
catholic, Christian, moral, honest men's good conceits, by demonstrating to
the world: how all their religious piety in show, is but a rainebow cloud, of
atheall policy in action, drawn up in vaporous, dewes of cold congealed
devotions interchangeably mixed with exhalated smokes of sparkling, hot,
inflamed, dispersed, sublimed aspires: It rests only in this tenth and last
Quodlibet of the Jesuits variable plots, and devises; to show unto you, what
their hope is, or rather what the grounds are of that broken hope they have of
attaining at length unto an absolute monarchy over all the world. And this
being the great mark they shoot at, Vt ad causam finalem vel effectum, As to
the primary, principal, and final effect whereunto caetera agentia, all their
acts, intents, drifts, and devises are directed to produce by actual form the
government (...) aforesaid: Now the hopes, causes, or motives moving them to
these desperate attemps, strange courses, and rarest practices premised that in
a world can be found or ever hitherto was heard of amongst mortal men are
built upon presages, prophecies, and prediction of things to come. And
therefore shall this last be termed a Quodlibet of plots by presages,
containing ten articles as the rest have a piece. But for as much as it is a
discourse of great, dangerous and weighty consequent, as a discovery of many
mysteries (yet to the utter disgrace of the Jesuits, and Spanish faction for
ever) as also for that the time, place, and other occasions, do hasten me to
make an end. I will therefore crave pardon at this time from proceeding any
further therein, as minded (God willing) to set out a whole Book of this last
Quodlibet, a second part by it self at time convenient. In steed whereof, I
have thought good to exhibit unto you this Appendix following.

AN APPENDIX TO THE QVODLIBETS.
AFter I had compiled this Quodlibeticall discourse into a brief method before
it came to the press, I was informed of the variable opinion had of my
writings by occasion of an Epistle to a little pamphlet entitled Important
considerations, etc. Which because I own it as mine own: and for that the
Jesuits, and their fautors according to their common custom and practice in
the Art of Calumniation, have driven sundry weak, (but otherwise devout) men
and women, into a quotidian fever, or shaking palsy, in assaulting them with
an erroneous misconceite of that subject: I must therefore in all humble wise
as an obedient child of the catholic Roman Church, and in all charitable
manner, as wishing no worse to any, then to mine own soul, crave patience of
the catholic Reader in this peruse.

First then (dear catholics) be pleased to hear thus much from me, Note by
this insinuation a notable trick of a Machiauilian, which is this, that if an
act or actor of any action by deed, word, or writing, be for a Jesuits purpose:
then before ever the person book, or other practice by him, be discovered, or
known abroad in the world: there shall a speech go in secret, as thus: do you
not hear of such a man, or book, or attempts etc. o the worthiest man, the
rarest book, etc. and so extolling of every thing to the skies (though
unworthy the naming) this speech passing current over all, the next that
follows (when the men or matters are tried, and found ridiculous with the
wiser sort) shall never possibly be able to overtake this passage, or to
persuade the mobile vulgus to the contrary. And again, if the said persons, or
book, be opposite to the Jesuits, then they knowing thereof by their spials
ere ever it be known abroad, a speech carried over all by fame of a most
infamous person, book etc. is past ouertaking with a true re^ort, when the
truth is known. And even so just is the case concerning the late books so
mightily (but most falsely) disgraced by the Jesuits, ere ever they came to
open view that even the innocent, have been in danger to applaude unto their
guilty fears, and many ignorantly refused at all to read them as too too
credulous: and not considering the Jesuits drift therein.

A notable policy of the Jesuits to get some Neuters to spread abroad a
detraction, or what they would have odious, knowing that fame is irreuocable,
and a word once spoken, can not be recalled.


that I expected no less before ever I set pen to paper, then to hear the
matter to be made seem so odious by a trick of Machiauell as now it is come
to pass. Yea, they that knew how some of my brethren of a tender, soft, and
mild nature did fear before hand, I would be too sharp if once the Northern
blood were up, they (the Jesuits) had never been worthy the name of
Matchiauelians, Politicians, or masters of their crafty, sly, deceitful
occupation, if they would not have fished so far before the net (knowing by
their spials that the said book was come out: I promise you ere ever I knew it
my self) as to preoccupate by anticipation, devout minds of men and women,
with a conceit of monsters, of prodigies, of wonders in a sense detestable to
be contained in that pamphlet: as well because by W. W. it seemed to be mine,
and therefore conceited straight to be bitter as gall: as also for that the
title of mild, and merciful, by a wrangling sophistical Jesuits
interpretation, imported a condemnation of all catholics in general: and
these with other perticulars (applied in very deed, and meant only, wholly and
absolutely of the Jesuits, and their followers of the Spaniardes faction, but
wrested by them to the secular and seminary priests, together with all other
catholics in general) gave such light to that watchful crewe how to frame a
cogging argument to make both the work, and Author seem odious, as the
simpler sort, yea and some in other respects wise enough though they dearly
affected the seculars and their cause, and deeply detested the Jesuits and
their faction: yet were they amazed, appald, and greatly affrighted with the
sudden fear these Polypragmons had put into their heads by a company of
neuters or impersonals, in terra viuentium. And fame being the swiftest bird of
wing that ever seized on pray, no sooner had these neuters (set on thus by the
Jesuits) cast off that haggard hawke from a false fist, but presently taking
her irreuocable gate in a gadding mount she flew a foul flight in windings,
twindings, and girdings over all, making many a sweet bird to tremble and
quake when they heard that a catholic priest should have written such vild
matters against all conscience, religion, sense, or reason, as to them at first
it seemed. But I build so much upon the equity of our common cause, and mine
own innocence and sincere intent, therein, as were that Epistle to write
again, I would write verbatim as it is, and nothing doubt but that their
impiety, plots, and sly devises, will turn at length to their shame, and my
credit for the same.

Secondly, the most I do wonder at in these strange conceits of you (dear
catholics) is your simplicity and extreme folly (pardon me for God sake if I
speak home, for deep is the wound that pearceth to the heart, and dead is the
stroke that cuts life and soul a sunder) in that you think it a hinderance to
our cause, to have such books set out in painting forth the Jesuits in their
proper colors. Which conceit of yours (by your leave dear catholics) may
perhaps in it self have (and I doubt not but it has in your charitable devout
hearts and intentions) some sparks of piety, but certainly not at all of
policy, as manifesting that to be true which they report of you and us all for
this point: in declaring your judgment to be very weak, your wits shallow,
your apprehe^sion mean, your reach short, and your selves fitter for a
cloister then in very deed the Jesuits are: but withal they more fit to manage
a matter in a civil, political, secular, temporal common wealth: yea, or in the
field of war then any of you are that have such pusillanimous spirits, as they
affirm we have all: and therefore ride us like fools, lead us which way they
list, and make us believe what they please to serve their own turn withal.
For if you were of judgment and discourse, you would not but conceive and see
what here I mean (God willing, and if in nature it be possible) to drive into
your heads, to wit that the chief and original cause and occasion given of
temptation on our part, to the Jesuits has been our serupulous remissnes,
childish nicenes, and womanlike tenderness in speaking, writing or uttering of
our griefs and wrongs put up at the Jesuits hands, which made them so bold to
attempt, and peremptory to control: so that accounting of us all to be but
silly bodies and sorry fellows of no talent, gift or ability, like Storkish
kings they came upon us poor frogs with minaces of death to him that first
should leap out of the puddle from under their tyranny. And thus the erroneous
conceit you had of their worth, and our and your own unworthiness puffed them
up in pride, pulled us all down in miseserie, and blew the coal of their
perdition through your indiscreet humility, renuntiation and silence.

Note the Jesuits immitate Lucifer in pride; for he cannot endure to be
despised, or to have any creature accounted of for rare indowments of nature
but himself: and the Jesuits cannot abide to be counted of, as good, devout,
simple, religious men, but must be holden for the rarest politicians, the
wisest sages, the perfectest statesmen, etc. (fit phrases be they not for
religious persons to boast of?) and the secular clergy disgraced to the
uttermost, else cannot that Luciferian spirit of theirs be quiet? By this shall
you know a Jesuits spirit in that having presumed to have their brokers revile
priests and princes in the vilest manner as an act of zeal, yet are they and
theirs ready to fly in his or her face that shall but seem to dislike of a
Jesuit.
Thirdly, to enlarge my speech a little with your folly, you should have
considered that the chief vice noted in the Jesuits, is ambition and pride,
which being a stately sin, sitter for feinds, then for beggars to boast of,
as nothing torments the devil more then to be contemned, abased, and not
feared or regarded: so questionless the Jesuits having gotten an admiration of
rare esteem to be had of themselves above all priests (who are to be had in
contempt in respect of them and their followers:) there is no torture in the
world like this unto them, scil. to be made known what lewd mock religious
persons they are: and that those who are the best of them, yet if they fall
into comparisons, they are the meanest, inferior, and last of al other
religious orders. And now because these books do touch them to the quick,
and make them both know themselves and all others to look into them, therefore
should they want wit, or else have more grace then most of them seem to have,
if they should let these discoueries of their trecheries and impieties pass
uncontrolled or spoken against in hucker mucker, and not hinder what they can
possibly that none of these pamphlets come abroad to be seen, nor (and much
less) believed of any. And this you (dear Catholics) do not see into:
neither how that all these commisserations and hypocritical pity taken, had
their origin, sourze and spring from a Jesuits sconce, and issued out in arms
of maines from them amongst us to help themselves, and drown us in the ditch
they have made for us.

Fourthly, I desire you all (dear Catholics) search out the corners of your
hearts, and tell me of your conscience which of you all (be you priests or lay
persons) have suffered a sorer persecution of a Jesuits tongue, since these
books were written then you did suffer, before any of our company set pen to
paper, or who that has not written (but rather spoken against all writings of
a kind of scruple, as I said before) has been more spared or freed from
their cruel bitings (always supposed he be no current of their course) then
if he had written with the most, and as bitterly as any. Which being so, It is
most strange to see the Jesuits surfeit in persecution of their opposites, for
long ere ever any book or letter was written or intended, did the Jesuits so
mightily prevail in seeking the priests overthrow as it was a wonder that one
priests was left on live in England to make known their bad dealings and
extreme cruelty. But more strange it is that Cathol kes, knowing how the
priests have been and are brought, into an intolerable contempt and disgrace
by them. Will not yet look into them, nor acknowledge that the Jesuits are men
(at most) and therefore may sin as others may. Certainly I think their
followers (being otherwise good Catholics) are al bewitched, for else they
would never be so sottish, senseless and irreligigious in contempt of priests,
to believe none but Jesuits.
it must needs follow that silence has mightily disaduantaged our cause: it is
the only point the Jesuits do (and must if they will be holden for politikes)
stand upon, to suppress all writings to death: and seeing they cannot show
their extreme hatred (never merited by any of us at their hands) toward us
more then they have already showed it, be we silent or speak we out: then
conceive (dear Catholics) of our cause and case directly as it is, that these
books do only the Jesuits, not us (nor any of you) the harm if any be in
publishing them abroad: and it proceeds of great simplicity in you to conceive
otherwise, yea or not to see that it rises of a Jesuitical devise, to put
such a conceit into your heads. But be you fully assured, when we are all dead
and gone, these books will work good in your posterity to the extirpation of
al Iesuitisme and puritanismout of England for ever, they are so thoroughly
discovered therein.

Fifthly, admit all were true that their brokers have set a broache concerning
that book and those matters: and that it were such odious stuff as they would
bear you in hand: yet will you be so simple (dear catholics) as to believe
them in this, that they have gotten any advantage thereby against us, or that
they laugh in their sleeue to see us at varience amongst our selves about it
(as they say, but falsely as shall be showed anon.) For what advantage shall they
get by it when they are detected for seditious, turbulent, factious persons,
ambitious aspirers and traitors: and the secular and seminary priests cleared
of their conspiracies? Will this bring good men to be hated to have irreligious
persons made known: or if they say the word, will all others run riot with
them and so to hell for company? No, no (dear catholics) I will tell you what
the mystery and meaning is of all that blazon. Nothing does more torment an
envious man then to have others live and prosper by him. And so when the
Jesuits saw that the priests found more favor at the civil magistrates
hands, then they could find, because they had cleared themselves of all state
meddles which the Jesuits to death can not do: then envy burst out as all the
world may see it in them. Again nothing is more duly observed in Machiauels
school the^ always to cast plots by co^traries. As for example if you would
have any thing done or said by your enemy for your advantage: then put on a
cowardly face of fear least such a thing should happen, and that seeming kind
of trembling and unwillingness showed in you, will make him more eager in despite
to prosecute it. But if you fear such words, writings or other acts indeed:
and that it be so as possibly you cannot stop nor hinder it: then laugh at it,
make it seem odious or ridiculous: and in disgrace of the actor or author,
seem to make small or no account of it: and retort it, if it be possible by
hook or crook, upon your adversary: or at least band it out with outward show
of advantage on your part against him, to as many as you can come or send unto:
and especially those such as are or may be thought to side on his side against
you. And this is just the Jesuits crafty drift, and your ignorance in not
seeing into their policy. For whether any thing make for us or not, it is not
the question: but would they trow you be so careful and diligent by their
neuters to have us know before hand, how mightily we are disaduantaged by our
writings if it were so? No, no, we never yet could find that charity in them:
and so letting it pass for an ordinary cog amongst them: a half witted man
may see there is nothing makes for them nor their advantage.

Sixthly, you (dear Catholics) by this your childish compassion and womanlike
lenity go against the principles, grounds and rules of all arts, sciences,
laws, customs, and orders: you go against that General maxim in the laws,
which is that, fiat iustitia and ruant coeli. For wherein (dear Catholics)
should justice take place in the case proposed, if we keep silence in
concealing the Jesuits great impiety, together with their and the rest of the
Spanish faction (their fautors and followers) unjust calumniation, irreligious
abuses, and high contempt of priests and all ecclesiastical jurisdiction and
state, together with their unnatural attempts, practices, and confederacies
against our Prince and country, and us all that are not of their faction. You
go against all custom and order. For what is more innouate preposterous, and
beyond all gods forbid, then this new fanglenes in you to prefer a company of
Jesuits (whose society began but yesterday in respect of many other religious
orders) not only before all other monastical persons, but also even before
all secular priests and the state ecclesiastical, whereupon they, and all
others do and must depend in soul points: and not only so, but you forestall
us in judgment, you condemn us, you justify them, you take upon you to be
paramount to censure of us both before you hear our case and cause: nay you
will not hear, nor read, nor understand what points we stand upon, but as
blind affection leads you, so wilful ignorance eggeth you forward to censure
us at your pleasure. And this (deer catholics) is out of all order, far from
all ancient catholic custom, void of all reason, conscience or religion in
you, running headlong upon your ruins through your simplicity, wilfulnes and
folly. You go against the divine rules and principles of charity, wherein
per legem Talionis oculus pro oculo, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a
tongue for a tongue, a hand for an hand is given on the one side to defend (for
you know vim vi repellere licet) and on the other to make satisfaction. To
perswad a Jesuit to make satisfaction were as hard a matter, as to wreest the
club out of Hercules fist; to wring water out of a flint, or to drink up the
Thames at a haust. To put them to silence by our silence, it were a thing
impossible: for the more silent we were, the more fiercely (like false hearted
cowards) they insulted over us. To live disgraced, defamed, and contemned for
atheists, apostataes and reprobates as they accounted us, was a crueller death
then to have been torn in pieces and eaten up alive amongst Anthropophagies.
What should we do then? To escape their tongue torments (yea and hand
tortures) we could not: and yet again common charity commands us, our legifer
preached it, his apostle affirmed it, that he who is careless of his good name
is worse then an infidel: and careless should we be, as hitherto we have
been (as too too scrupulous in these points, God forgive us for it) if we
should still sleep with a broken head, with a wounded heart, with a mangled
conscience torn in pieces by them, and never seek redress, nor for amends at
their hands. Which redress and amends let any (whosoever that think
themselves most politic, most prudent, most wise) set me down and approve it
(the premises and circumstances of the case and our cause considered) the way
and means, how ever to have wrought or brought it to pass, otherwise then by
making the Jesuits known what wicked men they are, and I will be his bondsman
for evermore. And this (dear catholics) was another gross error in the
indiscreet zeal of your devout folly, quite contrary to the rules and precept
of charity: which I greatly wonder at, in that you seeing us condemned,
contemned and rejected for the vilest creatures on earth: our company and
presence shunned and avoided: our speech, names, and persons holden for most
odious: our sacrifices, sacraments and poor devotions accounted of as
schismatic, profane and damnable: damnable (oh damnable) not only in
secular priests to offer any, but also in the laity to come at any offered by
us: our dear brethren reverend priests, your true ancient catholic, loving
ghostly fathers, ready to shed their best blood for your souls behalf, Was
it not monstrous in a Jesuit broker in Fetter lane, hearing that Master Clarke
a reverend priest was very sick in prison, and could through the Jesuitical
cruelty get no relief, to say he is well enough served: let him die and
starve for his disobedience etc. what think you (dear catholics) would these
Jesuits and their seditious faction do if they had the sword in their hands,
that are thus cruel hearted toward afflicted catholic priests. Questionless
should once a Jesuit and Spaniard bear sway in England, there is not one of
you that now run not with them should be left on live: yea think (as true it
is) that many of their brokers should then be cut off as unprofitable members
in their atheall common wealth, etc.
lying some of them in prison ready to perish for want of food, others
tormented with slanders well nigh to death: many forced to yield against their
conscience to a Jesuits cursed will and proud mind, and all brought into
obloquie, shame and disgrace, that would not run when a Jesuit gave a nod to
bid them go. And yet you (dear catholics) seeing all this, will you or can
you in your conscience wish us to keep silence? If you say you could wish it,
then you go flat against the rules of charity, Charitas enim incipit a
seipso. If needs we must die, all laws allow it to kill before we be killed
in our own defense: to suffer the infamy, reproach and shame to fall upon the
guilty, rather then the innocent to be condemned: and to let every ass bear
his own burden rather, then to lay al upon the weakest. If you think we have
just cause to speak and write in our own defense, but yet not in detecting
them: then tell me which way the one can be without the other, and I will cry
peccaui. If you admit it necessary to have them detected and made known, but
yet not in such bitter terms: then tell me what terms (dear catholics) do
I use not agreeing to their deserts, yea or half so bitter or exorbitant as
theirs are against the innocent? Do I call them apostataes, or heretics, or
schismatikes, or southsaiers, or reprobates, with many such like, as odious to
the ear, though none more detestable to the soul possessed with them, which
they not only have imposed upon us, but also made you (dear catholics) under
that pretense to refuse, to despise, to detest us for such. But what do I call
them? Mary I call them seditious, because no company, nor society, nor order
in any of the three states ecclesiastical, temporal, or monastical can live
quiet by them: I call them factious, because they band out all their doings by
making of parties, drawing of companies to side with them, threatening of
opposites, promising of great matters to their fautors and followers: and
setting all in an uproar with jealousy, suspicion, and backbiting one an
other: I call them traitors, because of their many conspiracies, attempts, and
practices against Pope, Prince, Church, common wealth, state and all: I call
them by many such like names, but yet by none save only such as best do
symbolize with their qualities and lewd devises. And therefore you (dear
catholics) in this your partial doom set on by Neuters, go against the
laws and preceps both of God and man: which as you do it of a scrupulous
conscience, so does your scruple rise of simplicity, and folly, in not seeing
(it being as plain as the nose on a man's face) that it is the epicine Jesuits
which living in show masculine, in effect faeminine, in esse neuters, put such
buzzes into your heads, and when they have done, they ride you like fools. In
few (dear catholics) you go against the rules and principles of all Arts
and sciences, in conceiting these discoueries of the Jesuits treacheries, to be
a hinderance to our common cause, or any way to have hurt or harmed us. First,
Of all wonders so the world, it is the greatest in my conceit, that any
English catholic should so dote upon a Jesuit, and rage against all priests
that side not with them as to think it lawful, and to practice it as
meritorious in them to leave nothing undone, unsaid, unthought of to bring
priesthood in contempt, and Jesuits to be holden for sanceperes and yet cry out
of priests, if they do but clear themselves and shun the danger both of body
and soul wrack that the layty does stand and live in, by following of them
and their traitorous designements. But it is a right smacke of a Puritan
spirit in them, and of a more dangerous infection then a Puritanes wit is able
to invent, etc.
for that if you demand of politics which way to vanquish an enemy with most
advantage, they will tell you, by turning his own weapon upon him, in that
part wherein his strength is most. Now to the seminary and secular priests
(omitting others) I do speak it before God, and his holy Angels, and Saints,
I think there are not more infest nor deadly enemies this day on live, then
Parsons and some other of the Jesuits, and the Spaniardes faction are: their
weapons have been calumnies, infamies, and slanders: their strength consists
in vaineglory, vaunting, boasting, ambition, lying, falsehood, cosenage, and a
thousand such impious sleights, and devises. Therefore is there no way in the
world left to encounter them with advantage, but to retort and return all
back upon them to their shame and confusion. If you ask of the Mathematician,
how to pass betwixt two periods, he will tell you that ab extremo ad extremum
non transitur nisi per medium. Now that the Jesuits and we are in extremes,
they too lofty, and we too lowly? thty to ambitious, and we to submissiue: they
to stirring, and we to quiet: they too seditious, and we too peaceable: they
too clamorous, and we too silent, etc. it is manifest by demonstration in it
self: yet because many can not, and most will not see into it, therefore is it
of necessity, that the way, means, and occasions of the one and the other,
should be set forth to the view of the ignorant multitude, that are led away
through misconceite into error. If you ask of the Philosopher, or Naturian,
how to make the very quintessence and natural quality of any thing best made
known: he will say that contraria iuxta se posita magis elucescunt. Now what
can be more contrary then the Jesuits, and secular priests proceedings,
therefore by consequent, there is no other course to be taken for clearing of
the innocents, then to have both their dealings, intents, and purposes made
known in opposition set one against the other, as in these books they are at
large. If you ask a Physician how to cure a desperate disease, Doctor Atslewe,
if he were a live, would give you a desperate, yet a sound answer, but any and
all agree in this, that as Calida frigidis, humida siccis: sic contraria
contrarijs curantur: And always the more dangerous the disease is, the more
desperare is the cure: sharp corasiues are to be used, and few or no lenitiues
will serve for the purpose. Now I report me to you, whither a more dangerous,
desperate, and infectious a plague could ever have light amongst you and us all
(dear catholics) or not, then this Jesuitical poison is: which makes you
run riot after them: and so infatuates your Galathian minds as some of you
have fared like infernal furies, when you had heard or read of any fault in a
Jesuit, or of any defense of a secular priest: therefore maugre the devil,
and a Jesuits malice corasiues shall they have as fast as this hand can trot,
and shall be lanced into the quick spite of spite it self, without ever
giving over, unto you (dear catholics) be freed from further infection, by
them the innocent cured of the deadly wounds which they wilfully, and you
witlesly have given them. And these friendly admonitions given with hearty
desire of an upright conceit of things as they are in themselves, not as you,
or I, or any other sound catholic and right English nature could wish them to
be: I will now enlarge my self a little in more particulers (wherein my credit
is touched, and lies engaged by the Jesuitical faction, in censuring, and
putting into your heads (dear catholics) a deformed censure of my uniform
and upright meaning in the foresaid pamphlet.

The Jesuits and their fautors do object against me, or rather suggest to you
(dear catholics) many odious points of great importance and no less
scandalous; then irreligious at least (if not heretical) to be contained in my
writings, and by name in that book entitled Important considerations, etc.
The epistle whereunto they (and many of you dear catholics) say still deluded
by them through your too too scrupulous, credulous, devout simplicity) have
rashly preiudicated to smell of an heretical spirit: which they urge as
maliciously, injuriously, and uncharitably: as falsely, senselesly and
irreligiously, upon such frivolous wrangling grounds, calumniations and
surmises, as in particular shall be here laid down with the answers unto them:
making this humble confession in general before hand in form following: I
W.W. from the bottom of my heart plainly and sincerely without all
equivocation or doubling, in the presence of the divine Majesty and all his
holy Angels and Saints, in all dutiful and obedient manner, offer and
acknowledge by these presents, an humble submission of my poor self and of
all my worthless works and writings to the censure of our holy mother the
catholic Roman church, to correct and amend by her sacred wisdom whatsoever
has been, is, or shall be found amiss in me. And I wish no longer to draw
breath on earth then I have the least auersion of mind from her holy censure
and decrees in any one word, syllable, tittle or title, by her defined,
deposed, or decreed: humbly acknowledging that if any thing in that book or
else where in any other of my words or writings be fault worthy, it is mine:
and not our holy mother to be stained therewith: but if any quintessence of
grace or other good gift be in me, it flows from her, and is not mine but as
a wretched poor miserable (yet a lively) member of that body mystical, from
whence it is derived and given unto me to use to her spouses and her own
honor and glory. And if I knew but one drop of my dearest heart blood, or the
swiftest turn of a thought in my brains, or a word falling from my lips, or
but a leter dropping from my pen in prejudice of Saint Peter's chair, the Sea
apostolic, the catholic Roman church, faith and religion, our mother city
to be harbored, fostered or favored by me as such I wish (and attest it in
verbo Sacerdotis) unfeignedly from my naked heart both the one and the other,
heart, head, hand and all burnt into ashes and consumed in open sight. In regard
whereof I charge and challenge the purest and prowdest spirited Jesuit (or
whosoever shall dare so maliciously to call my name in question) on Gods
behalf and in defense of that body (whereof how unworthy soever yet a visible
member I am) I have resolved to remain and hope by Gods special grace
concurring with my good will to die, and wish not otherwise to live) to name
the least point or title for trial of toutch, taste or smell of heresy, wherein
they as appellants and I defendant may be first be found creant. And hoping
this in general may suffice for your satisfaction (dear catholics) on my
behalf and not to believe these false hearted Jesuits calumniations and
slanders raised on me hereafter, until you find by proof, toutch and trial
made of my works and writings, whether they be such or no, as they term them.
I will now go to the particulers thereby to make known their Matchiuilian
spite more apparent, and to lay down here more plain your ignorance
simplicity and folly. Patience dear Catholics, for I am angry at the devil,
and malice; which two have so mightily possessed your hearts with error, as I
know not with whom first to chide, whether with them in suggesting, or with you
in consenting, etc.

They say (and many of you dear Catholics confirm it in a doubtful speech)
that I have written against the Pope his holiness, and in prejudice of the Sea
Apostolic, because I affirm that the bulls and excommunications past against
her Majesty were wrongfully procured, and therefore of no validity: and again
for that I say, that if the Popes holiness should charge us to obey the
Archpriest and the Jesuits, yet we would not yield to it. In which two
cauilling objections they play the right puritans or other heretics, that
stand wrangling about the text, and leaving the common sense and spirit of the
church, they follow each one of them their own private foul spirits of deceit
and error, and so quot homines tot sententiae, So many men so many minds. But
to the purpose, I say, if they or you dear Catholics will not be smattered
with any smacke or smell of heresy, then do not wrest the text otherwise then
the letter imports: nor do not mince nor mangle it in leaving out the
principal part which gives light and life unto it. For wheresoever I talk of
the non validity of bulls, etc. or the wrong done to her Majesty in procuring
of them. I therewithal do show the case and cause why they were so sorry: for
that they were procured either merrily by subreption, or wrong and false
information and erroneous grounds: as that of Pius Quintus, whose holiness was
made believe that the Duke of Norfolk was a Catholic, and yet he died a
professed enemy to the Catholic church and religion; also that the Spaniards
pretense was wholly, merely and absolutely for restoring of religion: and yet
both by books, words and actions it has and does prove to the contrary, scil.
that he pretends a conquest of the land, if by Parsons proiects he cannot
otherwise have it by compremise and composition given him. And for our
disobedience to the Popes command in subiecting our selves to the Jesuits or
Archpriest, the very words following, (to wit, to advance an enemy to the
English crown) together with the whole context and tenure of my speech in that
place, and throughout the whole book does make it manifest that it is
absolutely meant in causes mere temporal; yea, marshiall, nay bloody,
inhumane, unnatural hostility in betraying our Prince or country, or both,
and all our posterity into aliens and strangers hands, by the Jesuits urging
and procuring an invasion and conquest of this land; and setting up an
Archpriest principally for that intent (as an ignorant plain man God wot)
fittest for their purpose to work withal. And this being not only a clearing
of the Pope of Rome for sending forth bulls, etc. (as most irreligiously
abused by the Jesuitical and Spanish faction, making many sacrilegious lies to
incense his holiness against our country, Sovereign and state: and against us
all that be native subjects of the English blood, under pretense (forsooth) of
religion, when the very ground was ambition and greedy affectation of English
Sovereignty) but withal a plain manifestation of high prejudice offered by
that unnatural Jesuitical faction to the Sea Apostolic. I know not whether to
inueigh more against their malice, or your folly in storming against me for
that book as you do. For considering that the whole contents, tenure, scope,
and drift of that book is to lay open the Jesuitical conspiracies to set
before your eyes the plain intent and meaning of the Spanish faction, for
invasion: to show the danger wherein you stand, that sway with those alien
Princes and their procurators, the Jesuits: who labor for nothing more then to
sway the scepter royal of this Imperial Isle: and to manifest unto you our
great dislikes of such unnatural practices: our intent to draw you if it be
possible from applauding unto them hereafter: our deep desire to take away all
occasion on our side of the argument, and augment of our miseries, and our
public confession of our own and hearty wish of your continuance in the
Catholic Roman church, and faith constant to death. These things well
weighed, and withal that there is few or none of you but will acknowledge as
much if you come before any civil magistrate: yea, some of your hot spurs
have already confessed and acknowledged more (and that by virtue of your
solemn oath) then I have written concerning this kind of disobedience to the Sea Apostolic, who notwithstanding having rayled and scolded against me since,
and in the fury of your zeal thrown the said book into the fire: I cannot see
what equivocation can excuse you from (at least a mental) perjury. This it
that which makes me amassed to see your great simplicity in murdering your
selves with your own weapons at a Jesuits crafty persuasion in finding fault
you cannot tell with what, or at most with that whereof when you are examined
from point to point: not one of you all but will acknowledge as much, and even
the Jesuits (though with a false heart in all or most part of them) in their
Apologies and other writings and examens have and will confess as much as I
have written concerning that mattter.

They say I use certain rolling phrases and Rhetorical words which smell of
heresy as in affectation of speech by often repetition of one thing (vz.
Disobedient we are, etc. and never shall etc.) and these words, Romish,
Jesuitical, and the devil, etc. To which I answer (as to the last first)
that if some words be placed or printed amiss as Romish for Roman, alas for
pure need what beggarly quarrelling objections are these: but yet to make a
direct response (dear catholics) I was not present at the printing to be a
corrector: nor had I the sight of one proof until the whole book was out in
print, and sold, and then too late to set down errata which in that word
Romish and in sundry others I found. A reason whereof as well to confirm my
sound conceit, as also to excuse the Printer in some sort may be this, that
where I had written Roman out at length there they printed so, which you may
find both in the beginning and ending of the Epistle, and thereby judge of me
aright: and where they found I had written short (Rom.) there they printing it
out at length added ishe, and so made it Romish, thinking it to be so as
English, Scottish, Irish, Flemish, etc. To the next to wit Jesuitical I cannot
maruael though they cauil about it: for some 3. years agone I remember a
reverend, grave, and virtuous priest, yea, and as sound, resolute, and constant
a catholic as the purest Jesuit among them all (that I go no further) having
written a very learned, religious, and priestlike apology or reioynder to the
Jesuitical calumniation about the Archpriest: and other matters because he
used this word Jesuit very often, and did not (forsooth) call every puny or
nouice of theirs by the name of a father of the society, or breefly the
fathers therefore was he censured then to smell of heresy: and only for that
word and none other. But to answer these carping Cynickes directly: I use that
word Jesuitical not in contempt of their society, nor of themselves in
general: for I always esteemed of it, as of a holy, good, and religious
institution as well in the intent of their founder Ignatius, as also in the
form and manner prescribed for observations of the rules set down by him: and
the more holy, because confirmed by the Pope his holiness, and for that sundry
good devout religious men have been of it (though no sance peers.) Neither do
I call them Jesuitical by way of analogy as the worthiest, perfectest, and
supreme servants of our Savior Christ Jesus or as we use the word
Apostolical. For I neither take them to be such Illuminates as to have any
extraordinary familiarity with God, or that they sit nerer his knee, or
footestoole, then other penitent sinners do and have heretofore sit
continually in this vale of tears: neither can I ever account of them for such
Rabbis as to excel all, or almost any other ordinary catholic in any degree
of perfection belonging to a true and faithful servant of Jesus. But I call
them Iesuicall (that is the faction of Jesuits) by abbreuiation to avoid
circumloqution, in one word expressing them to be a factious, seditious,
ambitious, auaritious, treacherous, traitorous, turbulent, machiuilian, atheall
consort that abusing the rules of their society, and quite perverting the
course, cause, institution, and intent of their order, and Author, coming
under a glorious style of the fathers of the society of Jesus, and being
commonly called by the name of Jesuits, they most sacrilegiously abuse that
tressacred name, and dishonor by usurpation thereof our sweet Savior Jesus
Christ both God and man, together with his spouse the catholic Roman church
and Saint Peter's chair, and successor therein: And as for the devil, I have
not named that foul fiend but twice to my remembrance throughout all that
Epistle. But suppose I had named him oftener, as probably I should if occasion
of speech had offered it (as never imagining such poor shifts to bring me or
my writings into obloquie, though I was told (and did expect no less) that
whatsoever I writ, would be more narrowly looked into, then any other of my
brethrens writings of a long conceited jealousy the Jesuits (good fathers)
have ever had of me. Yet what: was not this a simple reason to infer
thereupon, a smell of heresy in me? Yes questionless in any man's judgment of
common sense or but ordinary capacity. For so might they or you (dear
catholics) as well have said that as holy a man as lived in his days had
smeld of heresy for saying in a sole passage to an heretic Scio te esse
primogenitum Sathanae. Of like sort you might say all the four Evangelists
together with the Apostles so many of them as writ Epistles did smell of
heresy, because they named often that foul spirit, as I have named him: yea
(see what blasphemy you dear Catholics incur by this assertion) if this
were so, then what smeld our Savior Christ of, when he said to the proud
Scribes and Pharasies (such Rabbis as the Jesuits are) Vos expatre vestro
diabolo estis: and in another place when he said to his elect disciple,
successor, and prince of all the rest of his Apostles, Vade post me Sathanas,
etc. No dear Catholics) these be arguments fitter for children and women,
then for men of any quality to use or speak of, and in truth not worth the
answering, but to show unto you your own simplicity, and these patches policy,
that will play so small and base a game ere they play quite out; or that it
shall be said, they have nothing to lay, play, or say, to what is said, played,
and laid to their charge.

Well now to the first part of this objection concerning my Rhetorical phrases
and often repetition of words: I say that if the style, tenure and method seem
too too affectate; do you (dear catholics) me that favor as to impute that
fault (if it be one) to natures gifts not to smell of heresies, I ever
detesting the latter as much as who can detest it most, yea even from my cradle
or time of knowing sin, having an inclination and desire by Gods special
grace and favor (though wretched and sinful I, did not prosecute those sweet
motions so speedily as I should, but fell from my faith (received by baptism)
my maker and redeemer: until it pleased him Secundum multitudinem miserationum
suarum to look back upon a poor servant of his own, his blessed mothers, and
Peter's: and to call me home again) to be a catholic, etc. And no way
embracing the former of any nice affectation or premeditate intent of fluent
eloquence or settled study, how to be finicall in my speech, or seeking for
invention of exquisite phrases, or using the art or help of any Rhetorical
figure (all which yet in some sense might be tolerable, lawful and
commendable without all suspicion of heresy) but even as in preaching so in
writing as God and nature has given me a little mean, memory and poor and
plain facility in speech for delivery of my mind: so naturally such
passages do pass from me by inward motion (not affectation) ex abundantia
cordis writing as fast as my hand can trot quicquid in bucca venit; and never
to this hour could I have the patience to pen sermon or prick out a pamphlet
otherwise then (after I had laid my wits together for a three hours or a days
space at most, I had contrived the matter in my head; never writing any one
thing twice over to this present: as witnesses enough I have of all these books
and writings (so many of them as are done by me either in part or in all).
Which I speak not for my own praise: for that no doubt through want of
reuising and perusing of my writings many things are amiss, or not so well as
otherwise they might be if patience, space and place would permit me: But that
which moves me thus to write is this slander of affectation and by consequent
the smell of an heretical spirit, both which as I do detest to death, so
hope I this may suffice as a sufficient testimony to abate (if not abolish)
and take away all such rash, if not malicious iealousies had of me for the same.

They say further that not only I, but the rest of our company that are
opposite against them, are greatly to be suspected that we smell of heresy by
reason that we never writ of these things before we saw our selves in danger
of the halter, and were become very inward (for bad offices) with some in
special authority under her Majesty. Which to confirm and make seem more
probable, they incense you (dear Catholics) against us to keep you in; that
you slide not, nor wind your selves out from them: they allege first the
extraordinary favors which some of us have and do receive at the civil
magistrates hands over and above the rest of our brethren: Ergo we are naught
say they: then they reband this surmised assertion with the speeches which some
great persons should use: yea, and those such as are said most in show to
favor us, affirming (as the Jesuits faction report) that we were all bad,
lewd, seditious persons, and carried base and dishonest minds; that they would
make one of us cut another throat: that we had given the state advantage
enough by our informations and writings one against another, to hang us up all
when they pleased: that the Council did but use us for the time, until they
had gotten out of us what they could: and then meant to pay us home agreeing to
our deserts: and all such of the laytie as sided with us: that they (the
Jesuits) had as great and more honorable friends in Court then we had or have:
and all this for their resolute minds, and our inconstant dealings: which has
won to them honor and favor, and to us shame and hatred. And last of all they
allege the open sermons which have been made against us at Paul's cross and
other places, condemning us to be as dangerous to the present state and common
wealth, as the Jesuits are, and that which we write is but for a color to
save our selves, etc. To all which false surmises I answer in as brief a
manner as such groundless forgeries do require.

First, then it is most false that any one has written of these matters, for
riddance of themselves out of danger from under our adversaries hands: Nay it
is well known, that all those who have written, were freest from danger, and
furthest off from all likelihood or probability of troubles, or incombrance of
any whosoever that lived in England, or out of it of our afflicted condition of
life, and frownd of state: as by articulating the particulers is apparent. And
for my self in special witnesses enough I have of it, that these sixteen
years space was I never (to speak morally) in less danger nor more security
of keeping out of our common adversaries hands then I was at what time I first
received any token of extraordinary favor. Nay letters are yet extant to be
seen, which show that I stood so much upon mine own innocence to hazard my
apprehension, as knowing assuredly that (my function and profession,
priesthood, and religion set aside) no creature living could touch me with the
least disloyal act, word, or thought: I rested indifferent whether I were
taken or not, had not other motives byasde my will to acceptance of such
honorable favors as then were offered, and since I have found which were and
are lawful, honest, and commendable, as well in the donor as the donee. And
yet not to give any Jesuit account of the one or the other. But leaving them
and their puritanean fautors in their guilty iealousies had of innocents. to be
in their own predicament of corruption; I say now more, that before ever
book, letter, or any speech past from any of us of these matters and before
ever any extraordinary favor was showed more to one then to an other, or any
difference put or known to any civil magistrate, to be betwixt the secular
priests, and Jesuits, in points of statization and meddling of matters not
belonging to our professions: I for my part had written as much in effect as
since has come forth in any book, letter, or pamphlet, against that Spanish
or Jesuitical faction. Which writings being afterward taken in others of my
brethrens custody to whom I had sent them, make the case as clear as day light
at noone tide, that this is no new conceit had of the Jesuits, by any of our
company, and by my self least of all: neither done, nor set in hand withal;
nor yet intended of any mind, or the least thought of preventing our own
dangers (being in none at all) or yet of purpose to come in favor with the
civil magistrate by this means; the Jesuits and their faction, being the
first brothers thereof; and it having been our conceit from the beginning,
that their course was naught: and therefore our direct intent ab initio to stop
the impotent violence of their heady attempts, and unnatural practices so much
as we could possibly. And the only fault and offense (if any were) which we
committed therein, was our too too long silence, often writing, often speaking,
often entreating from time to time (but were rejected of that proud, insolent,
factious company and of you (dear catholics) seduced by them) for peace,
quiet, and unity with the Jesuits; and to have a surcease from all state
medles, libellings, or other proceedings, that might exasperate the state
against us, and you (dear catholics) that now so hotely are bent on the
Jesuits behalf, as in recompense of our good wills and tender care had over
you, you are ready to fly in our faces, and requite us with all infamous,
disdainful, and reproachful speeches. To the second point for our intercourse
with the civil magistrate, I have handled it sufficiently enough in these
Quodlibets, only I add in this place, that it declares a marvelous malignant
spirit in the Jesuitical faction, who being by their misusage brought out of
grace and favor, and therewithal having sought to entangle us and you all
(dear catholics) in their own dangers, their envy at our good fortunes to
clear our selves (and so many of you as will not wilfully be smattred with
their treasons and treacheries) is so extreme as they care not what they do or
say either to prevent our good or hinder your safety, or obscure our sincere
intents, or keep you back from inclining to us, and our course taken for your
quiet. Wherein they show themselves in this point to be right Origens opinion
that the devils hoped to be saved by reason that so many souls were damned, as
in way of justice and compassion taken, God could not, neither would suffer
them all to be lost for ever. So the Jesuits hope for pardon, yea and
permission to live in England, by reason of so many that are drawn to be of
their faction, as they can not be cut off without indangering the whole state
and common wealth, and therefore labor they so mightily to gain if but a
conuinence or esteem to be had of them that all catholics favor their
faction, their cause or themselus: or if but to speak against the secular
priest, or only seem to murmur or show dislike of them, and of their words,
writings, and other actions, it is enough. But let not catholics be therewith
deluded, nor protestants incensed by puritanes against us, by such statistiall
devises, for the devil will be deceived, and so will they in the end for all
their shifts and policies. And come dog, come devil, come war, come peace,
come torment, come ease, come truth, come error, come false witness, come true
testator, come what come will, well may we be discomforted, and serve our
Prince and country more fayntly, coldly, and not with that alacrity of mind,
nor agilily of body, as it were agreeing to our innocence we should. Yet shall
not all the art that either the devil, or the puritanes, or Jesuits have, bring
us within the compass of a treasonable or treacherous thought, against God or
his church, our Sovereign, or the common wealth of this land: but in life and
in death catholic (by Gods grace) will we be, and as loyal subjects as an
English soil affoords then the which none more loyal to their Prince in any
nation to be found.
Origenists, hoping that the more they have to side with them against us, the
greater fear they will put the state in, and make it more ready and willing to
pardon and accept of them upon any condition at their pleasure. For to that
sense does tend their banding it out with friends, their threatening of
opposites, their vaunt made of more honorable and great persons in cour^ and
country that favor their Spanish faction and cause: then we have that labor to
withdraw all English hearts from such unnatural intents, attempts and
proceedings. To the third objection of our common adversaries disgraceful
speeches given out against us more then against the Jesuits, it is a senseless
forgerie, and smells of a Jesuitical spirit, whose Luciferian pride is such as
it delights to be counted famous in mischief, extraordinary in suffering of
torments, and to have none to equal him in impiety, but all base and meanly
esteemed of, compared with himself in villainy. Which proud conceit seeing
the Jesuits have it, much good or mischief (whether they more delight in) may
it do them. I will promise them we will never compare with them, mary to say
that any honorable person should have us in contempt and them in grace and
favor for our opposite courses taken, that is as far from sense to think it,
as near to sottishnes to believe it, unless they could make us believe that all
the state, or those honors they mean of, are thoroughly spanified and entered
into a traiterous league and confederacy against their Prince and country.
And the like answer may serve to the fourth objection of making one of us cut
one an others throat, etc. which are childish arguments, and but bugges,
bulbeggers, or hobgoblins, fit to fear babies withal (as these patches by
their cogging, foysting, and devises, make you all (dear catholics) none
other, and yet you will not see into it. For what can the council, or state,
get out of us more then is in our hearts, and inward intents, and meanings; and
what is inwardly in us, which outwardly we do not profess and make known to
all the world? to wit, a catholic resolve for our Roman faith, church, and
religion: an English resolution for our native Prince, state, and country: and
a resolute intent (ever God before assisting us with his grace) in well, and in
woe, to remain constant, loyal, serviceable, and faithful to both to death.
And more then this, neither Angel, man, woman, nor devil, can get out of us,
because more then this we have not in us: and if this will cut our throts, or
make one of us undo an other, or urge the state against us, or cause us to be
evil thought of, and in the end cut off, when they (the said state) have gotten
out of us what may steed them, and the like vos iudicate. Of this I am sure we
shall dye for religion, and not for treason, and this is also morally certain,
that the state will never in policy (if we would like Jesuits conceit them
full of all impiety) seek the secular priests destruction, who labor wholly
for the preservation of our Country, and in excuse of their law made (so far
as is possible to excuse them) against us all in general, for some private
persons offenses: and on the other side leave them scotfree, whom they know for
professed enemies against them, and all the world sees how unnaturally they
have sought the destruction of our country. This also is probable that (if the
Jesuits have so many great persons in Court of the Spanish faction, and their
fautors as they make boast of) they may under hand prevail so far as to get
us all cut off together with them, without daigning us any notice to be taken
of our loyalty more then theirs; but if such an extremity should happen (as
questionless no one thing that craft of devil, or wit of man, or weight of
Mammon can afford, shall be left untried to effect it) yet, what then? shall we
for that, consent to the desolation of our country, and utter extripation of
all your (dear catholics) posterity, only to revenge our selves of so
inhumane cruelty, and extreme wrong offered us? no certainly, we will all
rather dye in misery, one after an other: and leave our innocent blood, to
cry for vengeance to him who both can and will take vengeance on those should
so afflict us, knowing as they do our intent and harmeles hearts. And last of
all, for the preachments of some at Paul's cross, and other places against us
equally as against the Jesuits, that first does manifest that we are accounted
of as opposite to our adversaries in points of Religion, and therefore no such
yield, as the Jesuitical faction report we have made. Secondly, it is no
marvel though they preach against us, seeing those who are most noted to have
done so, are known to be Puritanes by common report, and also by their
inueighing against sundry great persons in authority who are thought nothing to
favor their Allobrogicall government. And no doubt the more earnest and
outrageous they are against us, by reason that they hear already of these
Quodlibets wherein they and the Jesuits are coupled together in matters of
state medles, sedition, faction and treachery. Thirdly, who so looks into the
ticklish state of things as by these turbulent persons means they now do
stand, every one being already brought into such jealousy and suspicion of one
another, as hard to tell whether more dangerous to speak or keep silence in
these national contentions and factions, it is easy to be seen from what
spirit such preachme^ts do proceed, even none other questionles then from the
like blown abroad in the Court to the same effect, scil. that these books
have done the secular priests great harm, hindered our common cause, given
great advantage to be taken against us, and that it makes the Jesuits laugh in
their sleeue, etc. which is nothing else but an old stale principle of
Machiauel or a new Atheall canuasse of Iesuitisme (which you please) and in
very deed but a ridiculous jest to see what poor shifts these politicians are
driven unto, to pack and sack up sackes of money to bring and bind men's
toongs therewith to preach and prate in Court, country and pulpilt what they
will have them to keep themselves in; that they be not banished the land, or
put to exquisite deaths. And if any hurt come to us or hinderance to our cause
by these books it is this, No marvel though the Jesuits faction stop all
ways and means of making known their impiety, being forced by this
discovery to pay and lay out their evil gotten gold (whiles many a catholic
starued for want) to keep in, that they be not utterly cast out on all sides,
as well amongst catholics as Protestants and schismatikes. None (unless it be
puritanes, and such like factious statisers that begin already to discover
themselves by storming against these books, and the authors in open pulpit)
but do begin, and will daily more and more look as well into their perverse
hypocrisy, and irreligious policy; as also into the secular priests sincere
loyalty, and catholics innocence: howsoever for the time present, both Jesuits
and puritanes seem covertly to applaude the one to the other, in excla^ming
against her Majesty's more joy all catholics subjects then themselves are. But
a wonder lasts but nine days, and when passionate clouds are vanished, then
will all true English hearts, of whatsoever religion give thee thanks, etc.
to wit, that whereas before the Jesuits had us all upon the hip for god a
mercy, and threatened us with all disgrace, bondage, and staruing, which they
brought to pass for nothing whiles we kept silence. Now by our writing they
are and shall be forced to let corrupt Angels fly and pay sweetly for it, as
well to prevent their just deserved expulsion out of the land, as also to bring
us into the former obloquie. For what is it that god Mammon cannot work
amongst mortal men: and they whose hearts were hardened to see our great wants
whiles they wallowed in worlds wealth (given of devout catholics at the first,
for all our reliefes) it were contrary to Gods justice, and the Jesuits
deserts, if they should not find some cross encounters to make them spend all
again, contrary to their wretched intents and minds: for the saying is not
more old then true, that one evil gotten penny sets away a pound: and that
which passes over the devils back, must needs repasse over his belly again:
and so it is of the Jesuits evil gotten riches whiles many a soul mean while
does perish.

They say moreover that in the said book of Important considerations I do
condemn all priests (and by consequent then my self if that were true) in
general that are or have come into England, to be equally traitors as well as
the Jesuits and their confederates. Good Lord how these cogging mates belabour
themselves in sophistication and wrangling without any proof, sense or reason.
Well let it go as a false lie, calumniation and slander, as I both there, and
more expressly in these Quodlibets have manifested it to the contrary, setting
down, conceptis verbis, what a reverend conceit I ever had and have of all
priests that are not Jesuits in re or in spe, and directly acknowledging all
the seminary and secular priests (as in my very heart I do believe it, and
esteem of them with all respective reverence for no less then so) to have
died glorious martyrs, as suffering only and wholly on their parts, and in their
devout, holy, and catholic intents for religion and conscience sake. And all
that I said to the seeming contrary was that our adversaries said, and say
still they died for treason, but not any of us ever said or thought so, and my
self (without prejudice to any other of my brethren be it spoken) least of
all, because most of all and in plainest terms I have named above thirty
twice told of our company most injuriously defamed, slaundered, and detracted,
by the Jesuitical faction, all which (said I in that same place) are now
glorious martyrs in heaven. And further, I yielded a reason of our adversaries
opinion, why they account them for traitors to be this, scil. for that they
knowing directly by books, letters, and their own hand writings, together
with many witnesses, and testimonies, that the Jesuits had dipped their hands
too deep in plotting, practicing, and contriuing the means how to shed their
native Prince, and natural country men, women and childrens blood, the state
judging of us all promiscually, Any man that reads those books set out with
the Epistles before them, may easily discern them al to be different from one
another: and neither the style of and in all the said books to be out; neither
yet the Epistles to be of the same authors that the books themselves are of.
Only the question is whether the said books were set out by any secular
priests or other catholics of the laytie, or else by some Bishop or other
person of the English religion: the latter is utterly denied: as well by reason
that there is nothing in these books of any material point, but all those in
the appeal, yea and the rest of priests and catholics (or so many as are not
Iesuited or puritanized) do agree in, and allow, ratify and confirm the
same: And for the former, the speech, the phrase, the whole term is such as
any may discern it to be of a catholic recusants work: no Bishop nor other
Protestant in England this day, that will or would by word, or (and much less)
by writing, have given so many pretogatiues, or spoken so much in defense of
the catholic Roman church and secular seminary priests, as in these books
are delivered at large. But it spites the Jesuits and Puritanes to be compared
together, and therefore the one does preach, the other speaks, and both of
them fret^ so much against the secular priests, and Englands present state, as
they do.
not conceiting at that time any difference in points of hostile invasion to be
amongst us, nor, and much less knowing who were guilty and who were free: and
having withal just cause (standing the Queen and state oppositely affected to
us all in general for religion) to suspect us all alike; as coming all from
those places where these conspiracies were set abroch, and professing all one
kind of doctrine in all these matters to outward show. I therefore said, and
so say still, that as on the one side our single hearts did, and do justify
our cause before God, and in the face of the catholic Roman church, that we
suffered directly for our conscience and religions sake: so on the other side
the Jesuits prouocations, exasperations, and incentiues did justify the state
here in their dealings and sharp laws made against us. And thereupon I said
that (caeteris paribus) her Majesty's proceedings had been both mild and
merciful: and that we are not so much to exclame against the cruelty of the
persecution, as to admire how that any of us are left on live to talk of
religion, the premises considered of the contrary affectation of religion in
the state one way, and the occasion given another way forcibly in all humane
policy moving our adversaries to have left nothing undone for securing of
themselves from those dangers they saw hang eminent over their heads.

They say besides this, that I have renounced or denied the said book to be
mine: that we are at contention amongst our selves about it: and that all the
secular and seminary priests, do dislike and condemn it, as much as the
Jesuits do, if not more. Which notable Jesuitical devise (setting neuters a
work for this and the like blazons, as I said before) I answer at one bare
word: that all this is most false. For neither did I, neither do I, neither
will I, ever deny whatsoever I have written concerning that matter. And again
neither did, neither do, neither will any of our brethren whom we account of
as ours, to wit those in the appeal, ever dislike or condemn it in that sense
as the Jesuits do. Some others in deed there are, who favor our part, and
heartily wish a good success to our brethren that are gone to Rome (I say to
Rome if the Jesuits murder them not in the way thither, and then give out they
are run away: as some of the Puritanes give out they will never come there, and
the like do the Jesuits faction (right Puritanes in all these statizations): and
as the said Spanish faction did before give out of the former we sent to the
mother city, though by good hap their lives were saved) yet as their timorous,
scrupulous, and weak minds in judging of things has made them (I mean the
fautors of our cause) hitherto stand aloof of from intermedling up or down in
these matters: so also the like fear, scruple, and inconsiderate censure may,
and very probably has moved them to dislike, and condemn it: partly of their
own frailty, and rashness in precipitating sentence before they had read it
exactly throughout; partly also of a niceness, or curiosity (it being a fault
incident to many, to pick quarrels at whatsoever is not of their own doings;
or at least before seen, and allowed of by them;) but most especially of a
servile applause to the Jesuits humor, which diverse do use: who otherwise
would be ready with the first, to cast all the Jesuits in England over hatches,
if they once could catch them on the starboord side. And as well those as
sundry others (some whereof perhaps are in the appeal) that have as hard a
conceit of the Jesuits as I have (witness both their words and writings)
although they did at the first dislike it (and perhaps condemn it ere they
knew it, upon some neuters misinformation, given unto them out of it) yet was
their dislike, and condemnation of it, ever limited to the method and style,
not to the matter, treatise and tenure it self: and both the one and the other
dislike and condemnation, did rise of a provident fear, least the Jesuitical
faction, might, and would lay it to our brethrens charge that are gone; as
though they had been of counsel and consent thereunto (as very like they
would though yet it were a most wicked, unjust, and vile part in their
opposites the Jesuits, to charge the innocent therewith being now gone, and a
mere calumniation as the case now stands) and all this because that it is set
out in all the priests names: which in very deed is so, in respect of the
matter whereupon all our company do agree and confirm it as true: (and the
rather because in effect others have written of as much, both in Latin and
English before that book of important considerations ever came to light) but
not in regard of the accidental form and outward phrase of speech which is
directly mine in the said Epistles; and therefore neither all, nor any other of
my brethren to be blamed (if blame worthy it be) but only my self for the
same: neither (and much less) do you (dear catholics) think our common
cause hindered, or our brethren to be thought the worse of in general, for my
bitter, sharp, or exorbitant writing, in special; for that were greater wrong
then to beat an Oliver for a Rowland. And lastly, howsoever the Jesuitical
faction give out of me in this, as in other things: making (if it be but the
wagging of a straw) a monstrous matter, of whatsoever comes from my hands: and
enough it were to cause it to be holden for odious and damnable by their
censure, if it be but once given out that I did, said, or writ it (as a great
facility they have to coin lies by equivocation; to make any thing liked or
disliked of, as they list: and to give out by Neuters, what they please) yet
do you (dear catholics) daigne me, of your charirity, so much favor: that
seeing the only fault can be found with that book, in an upright censure and
sound conceit, is the sharpnes of the style: and this all, and only fault
being mine; and my will mine own, in the kingdom of my mind: and by
consequent then, no scandal, or offense given by any other; or justly to be
taken against any: and much less against all my brethren for my sake: let me
beg thus much at your hands, as to impute my fault, if not to a grant of
grace, yet to a gift of nature: I mean if not to an action of zeal (which I
hope it proceeds from;) yet to a passion of anger at the uttermost: and that of
such anger, as is, as far from malice, as free from gall; as ready to forgive,
as resolute to resist a Jesuits proceeding to death.

And because this is the only one fault that can be justly objected against me
(for as for all the rest, you see they have no ground and are but childish
reasons to infer so dangerous and odious sequells upon them, as that faction
does) give me leave therefore (dear catholics) to purge choler a little with
enlargement of my speech: to clear me of that crime: to put you out of doubt
of me: and to satisfy all infirm, and weak minds: for none of sound
judgment, learning or staid conceit, will err so far from all sense, in
their censure, of my well meant endeavors toward you, as you do.

You know (dear catholics) that zeal, charity, and love divine, Love,
properly respects man, charity the church, and zeal God himself: as their
immediate, principal, and proper object.
are three words of a different signification, in regard of their objects: and
yet may be, and often are all one, in respect of the subject wherein they are
inhere^t: as al three, being poprer acts of the will, are inserted in man, by
the benefit of creation: so are they perfected by grace divine, in the work of
our redemption, by application of the merits of Christ unto us, in the
sacraments of his church, as in the vessels of our salvation. And this
difference of affections, or distinction betwixt love, charity, and zeal, is
to be found here, and there, in sundry parts of Scripture; as well by the
words, as actions, and practice of our Savior, and his servants here on earth.
As when our merciful redeemer would sound his servant, and successor S. Peter,
his affections toward him, as he was man: amor and dilectio (both love in
English) were the words most, and all wholly in request: as Simon Ioannes amas
me, and diligis me plus his, etc. Again when he spoke in the person of his
sweet spouse; and what affection those had or ought to have that labor on her
behalf, and in his name to reconcile souls, and bring all into his fold, that
they might be made all vnum ouile and vnus pastor then charitas (charity) was
the word of that worth, as none could be worthier: and thereupon he said that
maiorem charitatem nemo habet quam vt animam suam ponat quis pro amicis suis,
etc. But when it came to an act, wherein Gods honor (as God) was principally,
immediately, and absolutely to be respected: and the honor of his spouse,
and sacred humanity only (as a man might say) per concomitantiam, as by
relation to his deity: then zelus (zeal) and none other, was the word of that
sufficient significancie, to express what kind of love, and ardent desire,
was, or ought to be in that subject, wherein it was inherent: and so said our
Savior zelo zelatus sum, and desiderio desideraui hoc pascha manducare
vobiscum priusquam moriar, etc. Neither amor nor dilectio nor charitas being
able, at full, to express with what an ecstasy of mind, and vehemency of
affection, our most mild, sweet, and merciful Jesus, did thirst after the
saving health of our poor souls, that the devil should not triumph for ever
over man, to the high dishonor of his heavenly father: but as well in regard
of satisfaction to the divine majesty, in rigor of his justice: as also in
respect of a redress for man's miseries, which could not be helped, but by the
full extent of his mercies toward him: that all parties should be satisfied,
the act to effect this withal, must in his proper essence, be an act of
obedience, in a willing mind, to undergo, for that end and purpose,
whatsoever should be laid upon our lord and master his tender body for to
carry; and that same act, we call zeal, in the highest degree of ardent
desire, of mercy and truth, justice and peace to kiss together, and make
atonement betwixt God and man.

And as we find this difference betwixt love, charity and zeal, to be
oracled from those divine lips that knew best how to term them: so although
the same three may be and often are taken in an evil sense, and therefore
properly said to be, some times in bad men, who do things of indiscreete
zeal, feigned charity, and unlawful or mundane love and affection: yet letting
these pass, and taking all three, in a good sense: although again, we are not
to imagine them to be, as they were in our Savior, in any mortal wight,
without some imperfection, more or less: yet do we find them all, in as
perfect a manner, as mortal state can afford, in sundry of Gods servants
during their pilgrimage in this vale of tears: as all histories, canonical,
apocriphall, sacred and profane, bear witness. For to omit the first tow gifts
of grace, to wit Love and Charity: because I must be brief: and for that the
third is the only one, which I am touched withal: for using inconsiderate
speech of indiscreet zeal, as an act of the will, wherein passion, choler,
or anger may be said most to abound. Was not the act of Phynees done of mere
zeal, when he thrust the Israelite and Madianite quite through together for
adultery? Was it not an act above ordinary charity in perfection (as a special
virtue of another kind) when the Prophet said, Zelus domus Dei, comedit me. In
which feruor of ardent desire, to have God glorified, in punishing of the
wicked: Did he not ( Elias the Thesbite I mean) wish for fire to descend down
from heaven to consume (and so it did) the two Quinquagenarian Captains, with
their bands of soldiers, for their malignant scoffing and contempt of Gods
servants? Was not Saint Peter's words to Ananias and Saphyra of like sort
denounced of mere zeal on Gods behalf, when for making but of a lie, or (in
good faith in a plain Jesuitical sense) a right equivocation, and that in a
more lawful and tolerable manner then the Jesuits and Puritans use: he
stricke them both dead at his foot with a word: taking the quarrel upon him
(because a priest and an Apostle) on gods behalf, as he plainly expressed when
he said; Why have you lied to the holy Ghost, etc? With what face could the
princely prophet, good king David have said, Memento domine David and omnis
mansuetudinis eius, after he had caused those that had slain king Saul,
Isboseth, and others, (in way of justice, and by the law of arms, would a
Jesuit have said) to be slain presently before his eyes: yea and to his son
Solomon gave a charge, that even Ioab, the general of his army, and as
faithful, serviceable, gallant, and stout a captain, as was in his days,
should not die in peace, nor bring his hoary locks to his grave, in quiet, by
natural death? or how could he have justified all his bloody acts, if zeal of
Gods honor had not been his guide. In few, when Moses the meekest man on
earth, gave one while charge for every one to kill his next neighbor, father,
mother, sister, brother, or whosouer, without difference or exception of
persons: And an other while bewailed so the sins of his people, that he
prayed unto God, either to take away their offenses, or else to take himself
out of the book of life: it was an act of justice directly in the first; and a
point above ordinary charity in the second; and both the one and the other
proceeded of a true zeal of Gods honor; which the meek Moses would not have
touched, no not though himself were utterly cast out of favor with the divine
majesty etc. For such ought to be all faithful peoples resolution, that
though they knew they should be damned to hell without redemption; yet should
they not for that, the less labor, to set forth Gods honor here on earth,
as created to do Gods will in all things, and their own in nothing contrary
to the will divine. And the like was of Saint Paul his ardent desire, to be
anathema pro fratribus secundum carnem, rather then to have them wallow in
sin, so as God should be dishonored thereby; as being forced to frustrate his
divine promises through the Jews offenses.

Conformablie to the premises (dear catholics) give me leave to enlarge my
self a little in this act of zeal. I neither dare, neither do assume unto my
self a perfection of my inte^tions, words and acts, in any sort to equal the
least or lowest of Gods servants, and saints above mentioned: humbly
acknowledging that as in respect of the inward man, I am a sinful wretch, and
conceit my self as unworthy as any Jesuit can conceit me: so also in regard
of any outward prerogative, I am Minimus fratrum meorum and indignissimus
omnium sacerdotum. But well said Saint Ambrose, that though we can not equal
Gods saints in their perfections, yet may we imitate them in their virtues: and
even so I, looking after the worthy memories and acts of others, have
labored to follow a far of such examples as those have left behind them,
whose natural inclination drew nearest in resemblance to mine own
disposition, helped forward with grace divine: whereof I will always humbly
pray to be partaker. And howsoever I am unfit to imitate them in virtue and
gifts of graces: yet may I presume without offense to any, to challenge a
childs portion amongst the holiest men (as they once were or are mortal
creatures) in humane inclinations, and in the gifts of nature, agreeing to the
three foresaid effects of affections proceeding from love, charity and zeal;
and that even in a sense commendable, honest, and lawful, abstracted from
indiscretion, folly, and lightness in me. And this free delivery of my mind,
humble confession of mine own choleric humor, and utter detestation of all
partiality, singularity, or what else soever may prejudice Gods honor, my
countries weal, or common cause, or mine own innocence, as acting all mine
actions in simplicitate cordis, of mere zeal (vtcunque) will I hope suffice
to take away all rash, if not peremptory, preposterous and malignant iealousies
had of me, for smelling of that I will auerre with my dearest blood, to detest
as much (if not more) as any such precise censurers of my thoughts do, or
shall be possibly able to give testimony of for their disgusting of the same.
And here a little further to explane my mind (if still you will turn zeal
into choler in me, and revenge into zeal in the Jesuitical faction: be
pleased (dear catholics) to remember that though all men came of one moulde,
yet are they not all of one metal, by reason of some aspect, star, or
planet shrouded in the sky, or of the clime, constellation, and influence, of
the bodies celestial, or other calculation, or natural incline, taking after
their parents, their site of birth, place of education, etc. To all which,
though will be free to yield or resist for astra mouent sed non cogunt (say
the sound divines) yet do those motions work, in some thus, in others so, and
in all diversely; as the diversity of natures does incline them, in acts,
either of chiefest zeal, or of moral, and natural motion. And that as well
in words, and writings, as in deeds and actions. As amongst the poets
laureate, Virgill has a grave and lofty: Ovid a light and pleasant; Horace a
hearsh, biting and satiricall style. Amongst Orators we have a sententious
Salust: a fluent Cicero: a thundering Demosthenes: and although all eloquent,
yet the last a full sumd or consumate Orator, terrified so the reader, in the
only peruse of his books, as the perplexed with his parlee, well perceiving
it, said, viua voce with a deep sigh fetched from an half dead heart: What are
you afraid to read? Yea but then, quid si audiuisses illam bestiam loquentem?
As much to say, if you had seen and heard, as I have the acts, gestures,
voice, words, and motion of the beast bent against you: how then would it have
moved you: viua vox having quandam energian in it, as Saint Jerome notes in
that place. Amongst Philosophers Aristotle was wise, profound; Plato humane,
divine; Pythagoras hot, precise; and all sound exquisite naturians. Amongst
Divines, Saint Augustine plain; Saint Gregory mild; Saint Jerome sharp, and
all profound, learned, virtuous, and the last most eloquent. Amongst scholemen,
Petrus Lumbardus pithie; Thomas Aquinas angelical: Dunsus Scotus, quipping and
yet Doctor Subtilis. Amongst the most famous preachers in Rome of later years,
three were rare, and all superlatiues in a different kind: whereupon the
adages, went thus on their behalfs. Tolletus docet, Lupus mouet, Panecrollus
delectat. In few amongst the Apostles Saint Peter was the only vterine, and
germane brother to Saint Andrew; and therefore by birth, blood, and education,
nearest linckt unto him, of any other: but yet in Gods concurrence with
secondarie causes, none did sympathize so well nor came so near together in
nature of all the disciples, as did the said supreme Apostle, with the vessel
of choice election. Of which two it is song in the church agreeing to the
purpose that gloriosi principes terrae, quomodo in vita sua dilexeru^t se; ita
and in morte non sint separati. For the later of which his own epistles make
it manifest how chollerick (nay how exorbitant and furious, if not heretical,
would a Jesuit have said) he was. And howsoever it seemed that the first of
these, had his emulators; even of those that were most modest, mild, humble,
and charitable, fulre pleate with love divine as was the chaste paranimph Saint
John, our Saviors love, and our Ladies darling, yet does Saint Peter's acts set
forth a greater zeal in him, then in Saint John: and that he had an
inclination to be of a practique or of an active life as a gift required in an
ecclesiastical or secular person even of nature. And therefore was it, that,
noting well how quick, hot, and hasty he was, full of valor, actiuitie, and
stoutnes, (as the soden motion showed, in cutting of Malchus his ear, and
after asking the question, Domine si percutimus in gladio:) although it pleased
our Savior to give him a gentle check, by his fall, to make him know him
self, and to consider that non in carneo brachio corroborabitur, vir. yet did
he never, after he was risen, and reconciled to his maker, and most merciful
redeemer again; stoop, yield, or give back one foot, in prosecuting Gods
quarrel, and the churches cause; in defense of both their honors, remaining
resolute, constant, and inuicted of mind, therein to death; even with the same
valorous heart, he had before. The old saying being truly verified in him, that
naturam expellas furca licet vsque recurret: the Ethiopian can not change his
skin: and caelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt: And be it in good,
or bad sense taken, yet is the definitive sentence in humane actions true, that
nature has her inclinations to this or that, according to the humor of the
subject: which though it may be altered, changed, and turned to good, or evil;
to virtue or vice, to well or woe: by reason of free will, and grace divine,
relinquishing, or assisting the internal acts, in acting of their external
actions, to produce the effects intended: yet nature always must, and will
have her swinge, in the progress, and manner of proceeding, thus or so, as
course of kind inclines her. And even so is it with me, in this bitter kind of
writing: which my sharp censurers might have pleased of their charity, to
have interpreted, as proceeding if not from an absolute perfect zeal, yet from
an act of zeal (vtcumque) conjoined with choler, or anger at their impiety:
but never to smell of heresy, as I will auerre it at a stake, against the
purest proud spirited Jesuit among them, that will or dare undertake the
quarrel for discerning of spirits (whereof they boast) to try who smells, or
stincks most vilely of heresy; they in pernicious vsurpate censure of me: or
I, in defense of whatsoever I have written always with, in, and under
submission to our holy mother the catholic Roman church, in all humble wise.
What should I say more (dear catholics) there are three internal parts or
portions mixed of flesh and spirit, and naturally inserted in every man, to wit,
pars irascibilis, pars concupiscibilis, pars rationabilis: and yet are they not
all, nor any of them, predominant in all men equally and alike: not all alike
witty; not all alike affectionate; not all alike angry, or easy to be
moved, and again appeased: and even all this by reason of natures gifts
(abstracted from grace divine, in corpore organizato) disposed in one thus, in
an other so, in a third otherwise. All mortal wights consist of four
elements, qualities, or humors, which reigning in man, make al men and women
upright humorists (less or more) in their proper kind; agreeing to the humor
or element predominant: and yet it is neither a fit consequent, to infer all
Spaniards to be chollerike, because borne under the hot fiery clime: nor all
Scots melancholy, because bred and brought up in the cold Orchadiam Isles, or
betwixt Cheneal hills, and Feynd felles, in the bateable grounds, wastes, or
borders. And for me (dear catholics) borne far in the north (and yet neither
of a white liver, nor melancholy complexion) give me leave in this one thing to
follow the motion of grace divine (I hope) or the instinct of proper kind at
least. Note that every one has some word, or phrase of speech to know the
author by, as more usual with him or her then with any other: So father
Parsons his books and writings is known by this phrase and method, and
especially by using much this speech (as all the world knows) which is to be
seen in his Greenecote in his Doleman, etc.


Many other childish, weak, and witles objections are made against me: some in
scoffing manner; others in malicious wise; and all simply (God wot) and for
want of matter. As, because I use this word (scilicet) very often: which none
that is a scholar, or has any wit or learning, would except against; seeing
none other word is more common amongst schoolmen for breuities sake, then
scilicet, videlicet, exempli causa, verbi gratia, etc. also for that I have
many parenthesis, whereof two reasons may be given: one for that the sentences,
being often times very long, are thereby made more intelligible, and the sense
easier to conceive aright: an other, for that I neither had time, neither ever
used to write one thing twice, but contriuing the whole matter first in my
head, I set down the particulars in the method you find it in, written raptim
as it came to my mind, which occasionated so many the more parentheses, by how
much the more as many occurrents offered themselves headlong one upon another,
each one striving to thrust forth his fellow to tell his own tale first, and
yet all to the purpose. Many the like poor shifts they have, to make these
books seem odious to the ignorant for want of better matter to work upon;
but how vain and slender stuff vos iudicate. Mean while pardon me for Gods
love, if I have offended any but a Jesuit or a Puritan, which two (though I
would not offend willingly) yet will I never crave pardon of for any thing I
have written on the catholic Roman Churches behalf: to whose censure I
William Watson secular priest do humbly submit my self and this work, with
the other ten volumes which I have ready for the press concerning these
matters. For I must needs be I, that is, a vowed enemy to a Jesuits and
Puritanes course in all true catholic zeal and English loyalty, so long as
they remain they, that is, the most infest enemies to the catholic church and
Christian commonwealth: both which good Lord deliver from their snares.
