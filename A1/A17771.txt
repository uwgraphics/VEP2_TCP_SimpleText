several offenders herein, by the Laws of this Land, and other Orders and
Compositions heretofore in such cases made and agreed upon.
I THat the high Constables and petty Constables within this Town, and the
Liberties of the same, do presently warn and set a sufficient Watch and Ward in
the usual places of this Town, and the Liberties of the same, to be kept by
all persons, as well privileged as others, in their courses; and by such able

Ward from five in the morning until eight of the clock in the evening: And
that the Constable give this charge to the Watchers and Warders, and that the
Watchers and Warders do duly observe the same, upon pain of imprisonment: and
not to depart until others be set in their place.

II That all such Watchers and Warders do apprehend and take all idle and
wandering people, and all other suspected persons which are repaired, or which
shall and will repair to this Town, and the Liberties of the same; and deliver
them to the Constables, to be sent away and punished according to the Laws of
this Land. And that they keep out of this Town all wandering Pedlers, Tinkers,
Aquavitae-men, and such like; and all strangers, and all carriages and goods,
that may be suspected to bring infection or danger to this Universitie or Town,
until they be allowed to be entertained or received by the said
Vicechancellour, or Major, or some other Justice of Peace of either Body: and
that they keep a true book of the name of every person, and his goods thus
allowed, and by whom.

III That the Churchwardens, Constables, and Overseers of every parish, do
every day (and oftener, if there be cause) make inquiry and search in all
Innes, Alehouses, and other houses within their parish, for all passengers and
strangers, that are or shall be lodged or received in any of them: and if they
find, fear, or suspect any of them did come from any part of London, or other
place visited; that presently they discharge them, and give notice of the Host
or receiver of them, to Mr. Vicechancellour or Mr. Major, or some Justice of
Peace, that they may undergo such punishment as shall be thought fit by the
foresaid Vicechancellour and Major.

IIII That if in such search, or at any other time the said Churchwardens,
Constables, or Overseers, or any of them, do observe and see, or shall be
credibly informed of any drunken persons, swearers, or blasphemers; or find,
or be informed that any persons do remain idle, misspending their time in
drinking, gaming, or otherwise, within any Tavern, Inn, Alehouse, or other
place within this Town, or Liberties of the same; that without favor, or any
partiality, they see them presently punished, according to the Statute in such
cases provided; or make present complaint of them and their receivers, to the
Vicechancellour and Major.

V That no person do carry, or recarrie any passengers, goods, wares, or
merchandise by land or water, from this Town to London, or from London to or

Glenton, who only is allowed to carry and recarry Letters, and nothing else,
to and from London.

VI That the aforesaid Churchwardens, Constables, and Overseers, do from time
to time take care, that all inhabitants and other persons within their several
parishes, do pave, gravel, water, sweep, and cleanse their doors, chanells,
streets, and lanes which belong unto them, every Tuesday and Saturday: and to
suffer no muckhills to remain in any pent-houses or yards, nor any hogs to be
kept in any houses, or pent-yards in the Town, nor to come in the streets or
lanes of this Town: nor any Butchers to kill any beasts at their doors, or in
their shops: nor Farriers to bleed any beast at their shops, or doors, nor in
the streets, except they receive the blood, garbage, and other filth into some
vessel, and the same presently convay to the common muckhill on the backside
of the Town, and that all carrion and dead beasts be buried in the ground, and
not suffered to ly in the streets or lanes in or about this Town.

VII That no person buy any goods brought into this Town by any strangers; or
carried about the Town to be sold by them, or any others of this Town, upon
pain of imprisonment.

VIII That all persons take heed, that they spend not their time in plays,
pastimes, idleness, haunting of Taverns, Innes, or Alehouses, lascivious
wantonness, surfeting, or drunkenness, which are the proper sins of this
Nation, for which the heavy displeasure and wrath of God is fallen upon us.

IX And further, the said Vicechancellour and Major do in his Majesty's name
straightly charge and command all Constables, Churchwardens, and Overseers of
every Parish in this Town, to take especial care, that all persons do observe
and keep the said Orders and Directions: and that they present the names of all
offenders herein, that they may undergo the severest punishment that may be
inflicted upon offenders in this kind.

X And lastly, it is ordered, that if any person shall refuse to obey these
Orders, or any of them; or to be ordered by the said Churchwardens, Constables
and Overseers, Watchers and Warders, or any of them, in any matter hereby given
them in charge; or shall resist them, or any of them; or maintain, or rescue
any offender herein, that then the said Constables shall commit such offenders
to the Gaol, there to remain until they be released by their competent Judge,
and be bound with sufficient Sureties to their good behavior.

God save the King.
