The Exhortatioun to the Lordis
O Lusty lords, and barrounis yat been bauld
That for good cause ar now asse^blit heir
Pluk up our hearts, lat not our curage cauld
And prise ye lord our capitane in weir.
Will e him serve e neid nocht for to feir,
The craft, the wit, nor policy of man
For quhy the Lord will it our Baner beir,
As he hes done sen first this cause began.
Have e foret how that he did us luif,
That time at leith quhe^ strangers did persew
Our enemeis hearts e saw that he did muif
To cum ouir Tweid us to help and reskew.
Quhair we and they our enemeis ouirthrew
Making us fre that lang in thrall had been.
Syne in this Realm plantit his gospel true
but scheding blud, quhilk hes not eir been seen
Fra e began from blude to purge this land
They murtherars they never durst ow bide
He gaif hit anis, and put hit in our hand
But any blude, upon Carbarrie side.
Syne after that, quhen lymmers loust ye bryde
He faucht for ow upon the Langsyde hill

Su^ chaist, sum slane, sum taken into our will.
He send Moses to govern ow and gyde
our commoun weill to reule and als redres
quhairthrow yis realm but rest did tin and tide
Go bring the same, to rest and quyetnes.
His diligence my tongue can not expres
Planting Justice both in Burgh and land
Da^ting rebels, quhilk proudly did transgres,
His maik ra^g not, gif yat his dayis had stand.
Richt prudently the Lord he did provide
For ow from time, he saw yat he was slane,
And wald not thoill, ow be without a gyde
Bot after Moses he raist Joshua agane.

Mair Fortunat nor Moses was befoir
In faitis of weir ane worthy Capitane
The Gentiles lands to you for to restoir.
Their Parliament of Linlithgow he did stay
Syne Breichen gat it, baid him not ane blast
Down was geuin ouir, for feir of weir assay
Paslay he wan, and now Dunbartane last
His Capitanis maid all his fais aghast,
Sum taken, sum slane, sum chaist into the se
Their deids should not, with silence be ouir past,
Bot worthy ar Eternal Memory.
our Godly cause hes now taken good succes
In Ingland lait, I neid it not declair,
Quhair my lord Chancelar tuik greit besines
With your good friend the Clerk of Registair
Their travel, wit nor gudis yai did not spair
For to vphald the Kings Authority,
In presence of they strangers that were their
Working for him in his Minority.

our enemeis they dar ow not ganestand,
Quhat e do schaip, ye Lord him self dois sew
Quhat e deuyse, he wirkis it with his hand.
Thairfoir make haist, lat nane be in this land,
To leif like Lords, syne proudly to rebel
Gat them both sweir and subscriue ye band
Or fail and this, do with their leuings mell.
And gif e dreid, yat sum will ait his ouirhaill,
And will not keip, nor it observe their bands
For startling hald the Kow fast be the taill
Appoint nane sic but pledgis in our hands.
And keip them sure, sen e se as it stands
For cum that time that all yat sort desyris,
They will but dout send ow in uncouth lands
To feicthe and feik, our meit into the myris.
Sen their Intent, to ow was never good
As be their deids richt cleirly may be seen
Gif them na leif to play with you buk heid,
As they haif done, ay waitand on yair queen.
Bot puneis all the quhilk ye know unclean
Of outher blude, and quyte yame for yair meids
And spair all sic will serve his grace serene,
And had na wit of nouther of their deids.
I wald ye did sum mair at this Conuentiou^,
Nor did your fais at thairs they held at Pace
Quhat yai did yair, I neid not to make me^tiou^
Bot weill I wait, su^ of yame rewis yat race.

This commoun well had stand in better case
Had it fallin in his tongue fell in his feit.
Sen God hes put the sword into your hand
Justice to do alyke to rich and pure,
Tak heid yairfoir and na wise brek command
Be circumspect of this your charge and cure
Gif ye neglect, than God I you assure
Will from pat rowme thoill you to be detrusit
Planting vthers into that charge ye bure
And gif yat sword to yame can rychtly vsit.
Be bent yair foir, and bide not this in blu^der,
Both the word of God and co^moun well aua^ce
e neid na ma bot Gedioms three hunder
To quhip your fais or yai get help of France
Make to like me^ sen ye half ordinance,
Ding draffen dou^ yat hald quhairm yai pride yame
Bring in ye nor^h with b^^^art bow and Lance,
Gif they rebel with tire and sword ouir ride yame
how and quhat way ye should appoi^t your bordour
Maddeis counsall is verray excellent
Scho did prescriue ane good and godly ordour
That to perform, had ye been diligent:
Hard ye the pure, I wait ye wald lament
Sa cruelty they Tyranis dois oppres them,
Slaying yame selfis, yair gudis reit and rent
For feir of God, I pray you to redres them.
Quhat man did hoip of gra^ge now dois appeir
His clothit craft of malice dois outspring,
As in his Proclamatiouns ye may heir
He dois Rebel and will not serve the King,
Tratours yai ar, agane you to maling,
He being Crownit in lauchfull Parliament,
Quha daures fastest with him into yat Ring,
To his Crowning both sweir and gaif consent.
Quhen the Regent gaif him that hauld ye saw
He was the Kingis, and sweir thairfoir to stand,
Albeit yat now, his grace he will nocht know,
Nor it Lennox for Regent of this land.
it Robert Hepburne being in his hand
And saifly entrit within that place,
He said he was reset by his command
And send Robert to my Lord Regents grace.
Quhill yat he gat yat hauld and house in hand,
Into this cause he was both bent and bauld
Bot fra thine forth than he gaif ouir yat band
And in this cause he leit his curage cauld.
This is the treuth as true men to me tauld,
That samin time his master was on live
He wald not lat him enter in that hauld
with na seruands bot outher four or five.
He hes not only sueruit fra our actioun
Bot dowbill murder he dois fo^tifie
Desyring bargane of any of our factioun,
Of his degree, estait, and quality.
We have nane sic, ye know in cumpanie,
Him for to match quhilk playit ye do whil knaif
For first he slew ane Master cruelly,
And syne betraist the last ye may percaif.
Bot it I know yair is ane hundredth heir
Of gentill men, and cum of Royal Race
On horse or fute, with quhinger sword or speir,
Dar weill him match, and meit him face for face
And preif him falls and Tratour in this case
He dar not fecht for this is his refuge,
He wald compeit at every time and place
Gif that he had ane vnspectit Judge.
And als ye se, he planely dois accuse,
The Regents grace of cruel Tyranny
Aganis his fais quhilk he doie schaw and use
In casting down both place and policy,
Sen they misknaw their Just Authority,
And will not serve, nor t^ obey commands
e may be Law subvert tha^r places hie,
Syne tak fra them yair lyuis geit and lands.
I know their letters ye sand into Dunbartane
Quhilk dois declair his dowbil deids Inding
Is only cause, I am both sure and certane
Quhilk gartis him make yis boist and manassing.
Bot it ye know it is ane commoun thing
For weill I wait ye have seen money fle,
Tuiche anis the gaw, and yan the horse will fling
Fra time ye spur and hit him on the quik.
It is your house that maks him b^ sa bauld,
Agane both God and King for to disdane
Except the Lord be watchman of the hauld,
The Psalmist sayis their watching is in vane
As ye have seen within their monethis twane,
Ane greiter strenth ye gat as I record,
Swa will ye one, to God gif ye b^ bane
And swa commits your wisdomis to the Lord
FINIS.
