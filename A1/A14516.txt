By the Counsel of Virginea.
SEeing it has pleased God, after such hard success, and the manifold
impediments known to the world, that now by the wisdom and industry of the
Lord Governor settled in Virginea, the state and business of the English
Plantation there succeeds with hope of a most prosperous event, and that
therefore it is resolved and almost in a readiness, for the further benefit
and better settling of the said Plantation, to make a new supply of men, and all
necessary provisions, in a Fleet of good Ships, under the conduct of Sir
Thomas Gates and Sir Thomas Dale Knights, and for that it is not intended any
more to burden the action with vagrant and unnecessary persons: this is to
give notice to so many honest and industrious men, as Carpenters, Smiths,
Coopers, Fishermen, Tanners, Shoomakers, Shipwrights, Brickmen, Gardeners,
Husbandmen, and laboring men of all sorts, that if they repair to the house
of Sir Thomas Smith in Philpotlane in London, before the end of this present
month of January, the number not full, they shall be entertained for the
Voyage, upon such terms as their quality and fitness shall deserve.

Jmprinted at London for William Welby, 1611.
