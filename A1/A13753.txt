A discovery of the treasons practiced and attempted against the Queens
Majesty and the Realm, by Francis Throckmorton, who was for the same
arraigned and condemned in Guyld Hall, in the City of London, the one and
twenty day of May last past.

1584.

To the Reader.
THere is in this short discourse delivered unto thee (gentle reader) a true
report of the treasons and practices of Francis Throckmorton, and his co^plices
against the Queens Majesty and the Realm: which coming to my hands by
chance from a gentleman, to whom it was sent into the Country, I have presumed
to commit the same to the print, to the end that such as in opinion and
conceit are not satisfied, touching the matters proved against him, and the
course of proceeding held with him, might by the sight thereof (if truth and
reason may persuade them) be resolved of all such doubts and scruple as have
risen by the variable reports made of the quality of his offenses, and the
manner of dealing used toward him: for the better knowledge whereof, I refer
thee to the declaration following, and so commit thee to God.

A letter sent from a gentleman of Lions Inn to his friend, concerning Francis
Throckmorton, who was arraigned and condemned of high Treason.
Sir, with my last letters of the first of June, I sent unto you in writing the
arraigneme^t of Francis Throckmorton penned by a ge^tleman of good skill and
credit, being present at the same and because it has seemed unto me that
there is some scruple in your conceit touching the sufficiency of the euidece
produced against him, I have for your better satisfaction endeavored to attain
to more particular knowledge thereof, and by the means of a secret friend,
there is come unto my hands, a verse perfect declaration, of the whole
proceedings held by such as were in commission for the examining of him before
his trial coutalning the material points of the treasons by him confessed,
where unto there is annexed a submission written by Francis Throckmorton to the
Queens Majesty, the fourth of June, whereby he acknowledges that he has
untruly and vnduetifully denied his former confessions, and under his hand
writing has eftsoons repeated and confessed the same confessions to be true
(some few things only detracted, but of no moment:) which may in mine opinion
remove all matter of doubt or scruple conceived by you or by any other of his
just condemnation. You know how well I have always loved the man, and
delighted to converse with him in respect of the good parts wherewith he was
endued, and of the pleasant humor that for the most part did possess him when
he came in company of friends, yielding at no time (to my seeing) any show
or suspision, to have been a dealer in matters of that qualitte: and therefore
I cannot but pity his misfortune the more, wishing all men to make profit of
his fall, and to note, that misery and calamity of this kind, does for the
most part follow such as forget God, to whose protection I commit you. From
Lions Inn, the 15 of June. 1584.

Your assured friend. Q.Z.

A true and perfect declaration of the Treasons practiced and attempted by
Francis Throckemorton, late of London, against the Queens Majesty and the
Reaime.
WHereas there have been very lewd and slanderous bruites and reports given
out, of the due and orderly proceedings held with Francis Throckmorton lately
anaigned and condenmed of high treason at the Guildhall in London the xxi. day
of May last, whereby such as are evil affected toward her Malestie, and the
present gonernement, have indeuo^^ed falsely and injuriously to charge her
Majesty and her faithful ministers with cruelty and injustice used against
the said Throckemerton by extorting from him by torture, such confessions as he
hathmade against himself, and by insorcing the same to make thom lawful
evidence to conflict him of the treasons therein specified. Albeit her
Majesty's subieuts in general walling to mind ye mild and temperace course
she has held all the time of her most happy Reign, might rather impute her
clemency and lenity used to wards all fortes of offenders to a kind of
fault, then tax her in the contrary: yet such as allow of practice and
treasons against her Majesty, de awayes interpaexe both of the one and of the
other, according to the partiouias affections that docopossesse them, that is,
to the worst. And forasmuch as the case of Throckemorton at this time has been
subject to their sinister constructions, and considering that lies and false
bruites cast abroad are most commonly beleeuch until they be ontrossed by the
truth: it has been thought expedient in this short discourse to deliver unto
your view and consideration, a true and perfect declaration of the treasons
practiced and attempted by the said Throckemorton against her Majesty and the
Realm, by him confessed before his arraignement, whereby her Majesty was
justly and in reason persuaded to put him to his trial. You shall likewise
perceive what course has been held with him by her Commissioners to bring him
to confess the truth: with what impudency and how falsely he has denied his
sayings and confessions: And lastly, how by a new submission and confession of
his said treasons since his condemnation, he endeavors to satissie her
Majesty, and to show the reasons thea moved him to deny the first, which he
affirms and confirms by the last: which may in reason satisfy, though not
all, yet such as are not forestalled, or rather forepoysoned and infected with
the lies and untruths already spread and delivered, in favor of the traitor
and his treasons. You shall therefore understand, that the cause of his
apprehension grew first upon secret intelligence given to the Queens
Majesty, that he was a privy conueiour and receiuour of letters to and from
the Scottish Queen, upon which information nevertheless diverse months were
suffered to pass on, before he was called to answer the matter, to the end
there might some proof more apparent be had to charge him there with directly:
which shortly after fell out, and thereupon there weresent unto his houses in
London, and at Leusham in Kent to search and apprehoud him, certain gentlemen
of no me anc credice and reputation of whom, two were sent to his house by
Poules wharfe, where he was apprehended, and so by one of them conuayed
presemly away, the other remaining in the chamber to make search for papers,
writings, etc. which might give proof of his fuspected practices.

In that searth, there were found the two papers contarning the names of
certain Catholic Noblemen and gentlemen, expressing the Havens for landing
of foreign forces, with other particularities in the said papers mentioned,
the one written in the Secretary hand, (which he at the Bar confessed to be
his own hand writing) and the other in the Roman hand, which he denied to be
his, and would not show how the same came unto his hands: howbeit in his
examinatio^s he has confessed them both to be his own hand writing, and so
they are in truth. There were also found among other of his papers, twelve
petidegrees of the descent of the Crown of England, printed and published by
the Blshop of Rosse, in the desence of the pretended title of the Scottish
Queen his Mistress, with certain infamous libelles against her Majesty
printed and published beyond the seas: which being found in the hands of a man
so cuill affected, comparing the same with his doings and practices against her
Majesty, you will judge the purpose wherefore he kept them.

Shortly after his apprehension, he was examined by some of her Majesty's
privy counsel, how he came by the said two papers of the Havens, and he most
impudently denied with many protestations that he never saw them, affirming
they were none of his, but were foisted in (as he termed it) among his papers
by the gentlemen that searched his house: Notwithstanding being more earnestly
pressed to confess the truth, he said they had been left (he knew not how) in
his chamber by a man of his, who not long before was departed out of the
Realm, named Edward Rogers, alias Nuttebie, by whom they were written. And to
make this device to carry some color of truth, after his committing to the
Tower, he found the means to get three Cards, on the backeside of which
Cards he wrote to his brother George Throckmerton to this effect: I have been
examined by whom the two papers, containing the names of certain Noblemen and
gentlemen, and of Havens etc. were written: and I have alleged them to have
been written by Edward Nutteby my man, of whose hand writing you know them to
be: Meaning by this device to have had his brother confirm his falsehode.
These Cards were intercepted, and thereby the suspicion before conceived of
his practices increased, whereupon, as upon other just cause and matter against
him, having bin sundry tunes brought before some of the principal personages
of her Majesty's most honorable privy counsel, and by them with all industry
examined, and persuaded in very mild and charitable manner, to confess the
truth, promising to procure pardon for him, in case he would bewray the depth
of his practices: but no persuasion prevailing, her Majesty thought it
agreeable with good policy, and the safety of her Royal person and state, to
commit him over to the hands of some of her learned counsel and others her
faithful servants and ministers, with commission to them, to assay by torture
to draw from him the truth of the matters appearing so weighty as to
concern the inuading of the Realm, etc. These men by virtue of that
commission, proceeded with him, first as the counsel had formerly done by way
of persuasion, to induce him to confess: but finding that course not to
prevail, they were constrained to commit him to such as are usually appointed
in the Tower to handle the Rack, by whom he was laid upon the same, and
somewhat pinched, although not much: for at the end of three days following,
he had recovered himself, and was in as good plight as before the time of his
racking, which if it had then or any other time been ministered unto him with
that violence that he and his favorers have endeavored slanderously to give
out, the signs thereof would have appeared upon his limbs for many years.
At this first time of torture, he would confess nothing, but continued in his
former obstinacy and denial of the truth. The second time that be was put
to the Rack, before he was strayned up to any purpose, he yielded to
confess any thing he knew, in the matters objected against him: whereupon he
was loosed, and then the Commissioners proceeded with him according to such
Interrogatories as had been delivered unto them, which for the more brevity
shall here be omitted, the intent of this declaration, tending only to
discover unto you the treasons and treacherous dealings of the said Francis
Throckamorton as well before as since his imprisonment, for your better
knowledge of the man, and manifestation of the due and just proceedings held
with him by her Majesty's Commissioners appointed to that service. And here you
are to note, that when he was first pressed to discover by whom the plottes
of the Havens were set down, and to what purpose, he began (without any
further interrogation ministered) by way of an historical narration, to declare
that at his being at Spaw in the Country of Liege certain years past, he
entered into conference with one Ienney a notorious known Traitor, touching the
altering of the state of the Realm here, and how the same might be attempted
by foreign invasion, and to the like effect bad sundry conferences with Sir
Francis Englefield in the low Countries, who daily solicited the Spanish king
in Spain, and his Governors in the said Countries, to attempt the inuading
of the Realm, continued a course of practicing against her Majesty and the
state, by letters between Sir Francis Englefielde and himself, until within
these two years last past, and that he did from time to time acquaint Sir John
Throckemorton his late father with his traitorous practices, who (as he said)
seeing no probability of sucoesse in them, dissuaded himfro^ any further
meddling with those practices.

He has further confessed, ye he used his Fathers advise and opinion in
setting down the names of the Catholic Noblemen and Gentlemen, and did
acquaint him with the description of the Havens for the landing of forces,
which he conceived and put in writing only by view of the Map, and not by
particular sight or survey of the said Havens.

Item, he has also confessed, that upon the intermission of writing of
letters, and the accustomed intelligences passed between Sir Francis
Englefield and him, he was made acquainted by his brother Thomas Throckemorton,
by letters and conference, and by Thomas Morgan by letters (two o^f the
principal confederates and workers of these treasons reslding in France) with
a resolute determination agreed on by the Scottish Queen and her confederats
in France and in other foreign parts, and also in England, for the inuading
of the Realm.

That the Duke of Guyse should be the principal leader and executer of that
invasion.

That the pretention (which should be publicly notified) should be to
deliver the Scottish Queen to liberty, and to procure even by force from the
Queens Majesty, a tolerance in religion for ye pretended Catholics: But the
intention, (the bottom whereof should not at ye first be made known to all
men) should be upon the Queens Majesty's resistance, to remove her Majesty
from her Crown and state.

That the Duke of Guyse had prepared the forces, but there wanted two things,
money, and the assistance of a convenient party in England, to join with the
foreign forces, and a third thing, how to set the Scottish Queen at liberty
without peril of her person.

For, ye first thing wanting, viz. money, messengers were sent from foreign
parts both to Rome and Spain, and their return daily expected to their
liking: And the Spanish Ambassador to encourage the English to join both in
purse and person, did gine out, that the King his Master would not only make
some notable attempt against England, but also would bear half the charge
of the enterprise. For the second thing, viz. the preparing of a sufficient
party in England, to receive and to join with the foreign forces, one
especial messenger was sent over into England in August last, under a
countersaite name from the confederates in France, to signify the platte and
preparation there, and to solicit the same here.

That Thomas Throckemerton his brother made him privy to his negotiation at
his last being here in England, and that thereupon Frauncis Throckmerton took
upon him to be a follower and mean for the effectuating thereof among the
confederats in England with the help of the Spanish Ambassador, whom he
instructed how and with whom to deal for the preparing of a convenient
party here within the Realm, for that himself would not be seen to be a
sounder of men, lest he might be discovered, and so endanger himself and the
enterprise, knowing that the Ambassador being a public person, might safely
deal therein without peril.

That the Duke of Guyse and other heads of the enterprise had refused some
landing places, and made special choice of Sussex, and about Arundel in
Sussex, both for the near cut from the parts of France, where the Duke did
or best could assemble his force, and for the opportunity of assured persons to
give assistance, etc.

That he, taking upon him the pursuit of this course, showed the whole plotte
and devise of the havens for landing to the Spanish Ambassador, who did
encourage him therein, he promising, that if he might have respite until the
next spring, the same should be done more exactly.

That at the time of Thomas Throckemertons being here, least the negotiation of
the enterprise, by some casualtie might fail in the only hand of one man
Thomas Throck, morton, there was also from the confederats sent over into
Sussex, Charles Paget, under the name of Mope, alias Spring, and thereof an
advertisement couettly sent to Thomas Throckmorten, both that Thomas might
understand it, and not be offended that another was joined with him in his
labor.

That the Spanish Ambassador by aduertisements from the confederates, was made
privy to this coming of Charles Paget under the name of Mope, and yet known
to him to be Charles Paget.

That the said Ambassador did according to his said aduertisements, know and
affirm that Charles Paget was come over to view the havens and Country for
landing of such foreign forces about Arundell, and specially to sound and
confer with certain prineipall persons for assistance.

The same Ambassador also knew and affirmed, that Charles Paget had
accordingly done his message, and had spoken with some principal persons
here, according to his commission, and was returned.

He moreover confessed that there was a device between the Spanish
Ambassador and him, how such principal Recusants here within the Realm as
were in the Commislion of the peace in sundry Counties, might upon the first
brute of the landing of forrame forces, under color and pre^rt of their
authority and the defense of her Majesty, (...) men, whom they might after
join to the foreign forces, and convert them against her Majesty.

In these few articles is briefly comprised the whole effect of his confessio
made at large without any Intert ogatonie particularly ministered, other then
upon that ^opapers before mentioned, containing the names of men o^ havens. And
here you are to note that at the time of his apprehension, there was no
knowledge or doubt had of these treasons, or of his priurtie unto the in, but
only an information and so pition delivered and conceived of some practese
between him and the Scottily Queen as to before mentioned. For the
discovering whereof, after he had been sundry times upon his alleagaunce
commended to declare his doings in conueying and receiving of letters to and
from her, he did voluntarily confess that he had written diverse letters unto
her, and had conveyed many to and fro, between her and Thomas Morgan in
France, by whose means he was first made known unto her, and that he had
received as many letters from her. He also declared the effect of his letters
to her, and of hers to him: which letters between them were always written in
Cipher, and the Cipher with the Nullities and marks for names of Princes and
Counsailors, he sent unto the Queens Majesty written with his own hand, He
also delivered the names of some, by whom he conveyed his letters to the
Scottish Queen, as by one Godfrey Fulgeam, who fled the Realm immediately upon
Throckemortons apprehension, and one other person, whom he described by his
stature, shape, and apparel, and the man since apprehended and examined,
has confessed the same: the man's name is William Ardington.

The sum and effect of the most part of these confessions, although they were
at the time of his arraignement opened and dilated by her Majesty's Sergeant,
Attorney, and Solicitor general at the bar, and therefore seem not
needful to be repeated here, yet because the purpose of this discourse is to
show sufficient proof, that the matters contained in his said confessions, are
neither false nor feigned (as Frauncis Throckmorton most impudently affirmed at
his trial, alleging that they were mere inventions of him self by policy
to avoid the torture) they have been here inserted, to the end you may the
better judge of the proofs, presumptions, and circumstances following, by
comparing the matters with their accidents, and consequently see the falsehoode
of the Traitor, the just and honorable proceedings of her Majesty, and the
honest and loyal endcuours of her Ministers employed in the discoucring of the
treasons.

First, it is true and not denied by himself, that he was at Spawe about the
time by him mentioned, and had conference with Ienney in that place, and with
Sir Francis Englefield in Flaunders, and that he has written letters to. Sir
Frauncis, and received letters from him: for if he should deny the same, he
were to be convinced by good proof: for it has bin noted in him by many of
his country men English subjects, that both in those parts and in France,
he did continually associate him self with English Rebels and Fugitives, If
then you consider with whom he has conuersed beyond the seas, and compare his
religion with theirs, you will judge of his conversation accordingly: and it is
to be supposed, that those men, known to be continual practisers against: the
Queens Majesty and this Realm, from whence for their Treasons and unnatural
demeanures they are worthily banished, will not in their conuenticles and
meetings forget to bethink them of their banishment, and how they might be
restored to their country, whereunto no desert in her Majesty's life time
(which God long continue) can well (without her Majesty's great mercy) restore
them. Then I pray you what conferences might M. Throckemorton have with Sir
Francis Englefield, with Ienney, with Liggons, with Owen, and with such like,
who were his daily companions in France and in the Iowe, countries? He has
written letters to Sir Frauncis Englefield: to what purposes? he haunted
continually two Ambassadors in London, by whose means he sent and received
letters to and from beyond the seas daily. To whom, and from whom? even to and
from Thomas Morgan, and Thomas Throckemorton at Paris, men known to her
Majesty and her Counsel, to be notorious practisers, very inward with the
Duke of Guyse, and contriuers of the Treasons and devises for the invasion
intended: and for very certain knowledge thereof, we need not be beholding to
Frauncis Throckemorton only, (although he has said much of them) but to
others of better credit then himself.

That the Duke of Guyse did undertake the enterprise to invade the Realm with
a foreign power, to be defrayed by the Pope and King of Spain (a part of M.
Throckemortons confession) and he in truth the first discouerer thereof to her
Majesty: if he will say that it was but invention, it will approve false. For
since he discovered the same, there have been diverse aducrtisements thereof
sent to her Majesty from foreign Princes her Highness loving neighbors and
Allies, as also by other good means and intelligences from her Ambassadors
and servants residing in other Countries.

If he deny (as he has done) that he never had knowledge of any such matter
when he confessed the same, it has no likelihood of truth for Throckmorton
was never known to be a Prophet to foretell things de futuro.

He resorted often to the Spanish Ambassador, at the least twice in a week
when he was in London: this often repair could not be to confer with the
Ambassador for the exchange of money for his brother, as he pretended at his
arraignement: there was some other cause. When he was apprehended, he had a
Casket covered with green velvet, very cunningly co^ueied out of his chamber
by a maid servant of the house, taken up under a beds side in his chamber (one
of the gentlemen who were sent to apprehend him then being in the chamber and
unknowing thereof) which Casket not long after his apprehension, was by one
John Meredith a follower of Frauncis Throckemorton, conveyed to the hands of
the Spanish Ambassador: and why to him? If the matters therein might well have
abidden the light, why should not the Casket have been kept still at home? and
if not there, why not sent to some other place of safety, as well as to the
Spanish Ambassador? It is to be conceived, that this Casket was not conveyed
thither without the direction of Frauncis Throckmorton, though carried by
Meredith, who did well know of what moment the matters were that were within
the Casket, and of what danger to Throckemorton if they had been disclosed, and
therefore meant to bestow them in a safe place where they could not readily be
had (as he thought) and with a person not unacquainted with the quality of
them. After the delivery of the Casket, Meredith fled: for in truth he was
privy to the sreasons, and a fellow practiser in them: to whom Frauncis
Throckemorton; being taken short at the time of his apprehension, and forced to
run up a staire to deface a letter which he was then in writing to the
Scottish Queen in Cipher (as he has confessed) being suddenly apprehended,
and so forced to depart away presently out of his house, delivered privily into
the hands of Meredith, either the Cipher by the which he was writing his letter
to the Scottish Queen, or a letter in Cipher by him written unto her:
therefore he trusted Meredith as a than privy to his doings. You are also to
understand, that Throckemorton was in very great fear of the discovering of
this Casket after his apprehension: for remaining two or three days prisoner
in the house of one of the gentlemen that were sent to apprehend him, before he
was committed to the Tower, he was permitted to talk with a Solicitor of his
Law cause, who brought him certain books drawn, or other like papers
written, which he made show to peruse, but that was not the matter why he
sent for his Solicitor: for in perusing ye books, he conveyed into them a
little piece of paper, upon ye which he had written wta cole, I would feign
know whither my Casket be safe, or to the like effect. The Solicitor
departing from him, and resorting to Throckemortons house not far distant
from the place where he remained prisoner, opening his papers, did shake out
this piece of paper, which he took up and delivered to one of Frauncis
Throckemortons men, but the Casket was already conveyed to the Spanish
Ambassador: whereby you will percelue what care he had of the Casket, and how
much it might import him to have the writings or matters within the same
coucealed. He being examined touching the Casket, and what was in the same, he
denied at the first, that ever he had any such Casket, but finding afterward
that the Casket was discovered, he confessed the Casket, and said there were
certain letters therein that came to his hands for the Scottish Queen from
Thomas Morgan at Paris, and other letters and Papers, but conselled not all, as
it is supposed.

That Charles Page^ came over into the Realm to evil purposea, as
Throckemorton does declare in his confession, could not be invented: for even
at the same time that he mentions. Paget came over, in secret and suspicious
manner stayed not above xv days, endeavored in a sort to find the disposition
of William Shallen Esquier, how he might stand, affected to give assistance to
the treasons, although Paget discovered not directly his traitorous intets to
Shelley: therefore all Throckemortons confessions were not forged or invented.

But because the two papers produced at his arraignement, containing the
description of the Havens for the commodious landing of forces, do most
apparently condemue him, and are a manifest argument of his priuity to the
whole treason, you may not forget ye he acknowledged one of the papers written
in the Secretary hand, to have been of his own doing, but denied the other
written in the Roman hand: In the which under the title of Cheshire etc. is
said, Upon the landing of foreign Supplies, Chester shall be taken: but what in
your opinions might be understood by that sentence, Chester shall be taken, when
you shall compare ye paper in Secretary hand with ye other written in the
Romanc hand, entitled, The Names of Noblemen and gentlemen in every County
fit to be dealt withal in this matter. (which in truth were both one,
although the Roman were somewhat more enlarged.) The question is to be asked,
What matter? The answer follows necessatilie, To assist the foreign forces
that shall come to invade the Realm: for that there is an other title in that
paper over the names of the havens, etc. Havens in every coast fit for the
sanding of forces. Now judge you, to what end these names of men and
descriptions of Havens, their entries, Capacities, what winds bring unto them
from Spain, France and Flanders, were written and set down by Throckemorton,
the papers are both of his own hand writing, and the Secretary but a project
or copy of the Roman.

Is it not likely think you, that he would acquaint the Spanith Ambassador
with these papers (as he has confessed) when he made him partaker of the rest
of his traitorous practices and deui^es is you have heard, and thought his
Casket of treasons to be most safely committed to his hands. It may be thought
that there is no man of so simple understanding, that will judge to the
contrary, unless he be partially affected to excuse the treasons.

And now to show unto you what mind this man has carried toward her Majesty,
you are to be informed that Francis Throckemorton, after he had discovered to
her Majesty his course of practicing, repenting himself of his plain dealing
in ye bewraying thereof, said to some of the Commissioners upon occasion of
speech, I would I had been hanged when I first opened my month to declare any
of the matters by me confessed. And being at other times sent unto by her
Majesty with offer of pardon, if he would disclose the whole pack and
accomplices of the treasons, he used this argument to persuade her Majesty that
he had confessed all, saying that since he had already brought himself by
his confessions within ye danger of the laws, to the utter ruin of his house
and family, he wondered why there should be any conceit in her Majesty,
that he had not declared all. But to persuade such as were sent unto him for
these purposes, the rather to believe that he could discover no more, at one
time he vied these speeches following with great vehemency: Now I have
disclosed the secrets of her who was the decrest thing unto me in the world
(meaning the Scottish Queen) and whom I thought no torment should have drawn
me so much to have prejudiced as I have done by my confessions, I see no cause
why, I should spare any one, if I could say ought against him and sub. I have
failed of my faith toward her, I care not if I were hanged. And when he began
first to confess his treasons, which he did most unwillingly, after he was
entered into the declaration of them, before all the Commissioners upon
aduisement, he desired he might deliver his knowledge but to one of them
only, whereunto they yielded, and thereupon removing asule from the place
where he sat by the Rack he used this proverb in Italian, Chia person la
feed a person l'honore, that is. He that has falsed his faith, has lost his
reputation: Meaning thereby (as it may be conceived) that he had given his
faith to be a Traitor, and not to reueile the treasons, and then began to
confess as you have heard.

By this discourse, containing the principal heads of his treasons, and the
proofs and circumstances of the same, you that are not transported with
undutiful minds and affections, will clearly perceive bow impudently and
untruly he denied at his arraignement the truth of his confessions, charging
her Majesty with cruelty, and her ministers with untruths in their
proceeding against him.

But the cause that moved him thereunto, was a vain conceito he had taken,
that his case was cleerein law by the intermission of the time between his
confession made and his arraigneme^t, grounding him self upon a Statute of the
13, year of her Majesty's Reign, in ye which there are certain treasons
specified and made of that nature, that no person shall be arraigned for any of
those offenses committed within any of the Queeues Majesty's dominious, unless
the offender be thereof indicted within six months next after the same
offense committed, and shall not be arraigned for ye same, unless the offense
be proved by the testimony and oath of two sufficient witnesses, or his
voluntary confession without violence: wherein he was greatly deceived: For it
was made manifest unto him by the L. chief Justice and other of the judges in
Commission at his trial, that his treasons were punishable by a Statute of xxv.
Edw. 3. which admitted no such limitation of time or proof.

Herein his skin failed him, and forgot the aduiee given unto him by some of
the Commissioners, who (pitying his misfortune for sundry good gifts of the
mind appearing in him) assured him that there was no way so ready for him to
redeem his life, as by submission and acknowledging of his offense, which for
a time after he had confessed his treasons, he was contented to follow, and
now eftsoons after his condemnation by a new submission to the Queens
Majesty the fourth of fune has resumed, that course. The submission verbatim
written with his own hand, follows.

To her most excellent Majesty, even to her own Royal hands.
MOst excellent Prince, and my most gracious Sovereign, since to me the most
miserable of all your Majesty's poor distressed subjects, being justly
condemned by the ordinary and orderly course of your Majesty's Laws, there
rests no further mean of defense but submission: vonchsafe, most excellent
Prince, graciously to accept the same, which prostrate in all hunmilitie, I
here present unto the hands of your most excellent Majesty, be seeching the
same, that as Justice bath been derived from your highness, as from the
fountain, to the trial of mine actions: so I may receine from the same (...)
some drop of grace and mercy for the great and grievous offense where of I
rest by your Majesty's Laws justly condemned: some part, I say, of that your
accustomed grations elemencie, whereof most your distressed subjects have
rasted, and few been deprived. And albeit the inconsiderate rashness of
unbridled youth has withdrawn me from that loyal respect, which nature and
duty bound me to owe unto your Majesty, as to my lawful and natural dread
sovereign, and that the natural care in me of the defense of my life mooned
me lately to the untrue and undutiful gainsaying of some such points as had
been before by me in most humble sort confessed: nevertheless, I most humbly
beseech your most excellent Majesty, that in imitation of God, whose image
(both in respect of the happy place you hold, as also in regard of your
singular wisdom and other the rare and singular virtues and perfections
wherewith God and nature has plentifully indewed you) you represent unto us
here in earth, it may please your Majesty to co^miserate the lamentable estate
of me now the most miserable of all your Majesty's subjects, and gratiousty to
grant unto me remission and forgiveness, that not only do most humbly
confess my self worthy of death, but also in show of my repentance and
sorrowful afflicted mind, do not crave at your Majesty's hands the
prolonging of my life, if the same shall not stand with your gracious good
pleasure, but rather desire the trebling of the torment justly by your
Majesty's laws imposed upon me, of the same may be any satisfaction to your
Majesty for the heinous crime whereof I remain by your Majesty's laws justly
condemned, or any mitigation of your Majesty's indignation worthily conceived
against me, that desire not to live without your favor, and dying will wish
from my heart, that my end may be the beginning of your Majesty's security,
and my death the preservation of your life, and the increase both to your
Majesty, and to this your most flourishing common wealth, of all the most
happy blessings of almighty God.

Your Majesty's most woeful subject in that he has offended you. Francis
Throckemorton.


HE sent unto her Majesty together with the said submission, a declaration
written likewise with his own hand, containing the effects of the most
principal points of his treasons formerly confessed: retracting only the
accusation of his father, and some other particularities of no moment to clear
him of his treasons, the effect whereof follows in his own words, as he set
them down. The declaration.


THe only cause why I coined the practice first by me confessed, and unjustly
touched my father, was, for that partly I conceived that the paper written so
long since, could not now by law have touched me: but principally, for that
I was willing thereby to color the setting down of those names and havens in
Roman hand, which were written long after the time by me confessed upon
occasion of conference between the Spanish Ambassador and me of this later
practice.

Mine intelligence with the Scortish Queen began a little before Christmas was
two years: the Cipher I had from Thomas Morgan in France: the first letter I
received by Godfray Fulgeam, by whom also came all such others as I after
received for the most part, unless it were such as came to me by F. A. his
hands, who as he told me, William Ardington.
received them of the fellow by me spoken of in my former confessions, whose
name, I protest before God, I know not, nor whence he is. And for such letters
as came unto me in the absence of Fulgeam, they were enclosed under a
couerture from Fulgeam, and were delivered me by the hands of Robert Tunstead
his brother in Law, to whom I delivered such as I had for the Scottish Queen,
covered with a direction to Fulgeam, and once I remember or twice I sent by one
of my men called Butler, letters for the Scottish Queen to the house of the
said Tunstead, near Buckstones, covered with a direction to Tunstead, and
under a letter to Fulgea^. In such letters as came to me from the Scottish Q.
were enclosed letters to F. A. many times, and most times some for Thomas
Morgan. Her letters to me contained, etc. But before I returned mine answer
to her, I understood of the death of the Duke of Lenox, and withal heard from
Morgan, with whom all mine intelligence was (for with my brother I never had
any, other then that the matters by me written to Morgan, were by him imparted
to my brother most times) that by the persuasion of the Pope and the King of
Spain, the Duke of Guyse had yielded to perform the journey in person: and
that it was thought that the next way to attain liberty for the Scottish
Queen, and to reform Scotland, was to begin here in England; and therefore
he desired to know from me, whether in mine opinior. Catholics would not
back any such force as should be sent, considering a demand of tolerance in
religion for them, should ensue the well performing of the said enterprise, and
what I thought the force would amount unto, both of horse and footmen, and
where I thought to be the fittest landing. Mine answer was, that as then, I
saw no great probability of the good success of such an enterprise, for that
the Catholics were timorous, dispersed, the matter perilous to be
communicated to many, without which I saw not how any estimate could be made of
the forces: besides, that it was an eminent danger to the Scottish Queen,
whereof I saw no remedy.

I took notice of this matter in my next letters to the Scottish Queen, whose
answer was, that she lately heard of that determination, etc.

Upon my former answer to Morgan, he desired me, ye I would confer with the
Spanish Ambassador, to who^ I should be recommended from thence: hereupon the
said Ambassador sent for me, and brake with me in this matter, assuring me ye
in his opinion he found it very casie to make great alteration here with very
little force, considering the disuse in men to war, and troubles would so
amase them (as he thought) that they would be as soon overthrown as assailed,
and he could not think but in such a case Catholics would show themselves,
since the purpose tended to the obteyning for them liberty of conscience: and
therefore he desired me to acquaint him, what I thought men would do in such
a case, and where I thought the fittest landing, and what holds in these
parts were easiest to be surprised.

I answered him, that as it seemed, the enterprise stood upon great
incertainties, if it depended of the knowledge of a certain force to be found
here, which no man could assure him of, unless he had sounded all the
Catholics, which was not possible without manifest hazard of the discovery
of the purpose: for as for any great personage, I know no one to be drawn into
this action, that could carry any more then his ordinary retinew: the only
way in such a case was (I told him) for such as would be drawn into this
matter, and were of credit in their countries, to levy forces under color of
the Princes authority.

But for that these things depended upon uncertain grounds, which was not fit
to be used in so great an action, I said it was to be resolved, that the force
to be sent should be of that number, that what backing soever they should
find here, they might be able of themselves to encounter with any force that
might be provided to be sent against them, and therefore they could not be
less then 15000. men. For the place of their landing, I said it depended much
upon the force that should be sent: for if that were in great number, it
mattered not where they landed: if in a small company, then was it requisite
that it should be in the Countries best affected, and furthest from her
Majesty's principal forces, which I said to be in the Northren parts on either
side.

To the danger of the Scottish Queen by me objected, he said he knew no
remedy, unless she might be taken away by some 200. horse, which I told him
I saw not to be possible, for that I knew not any gentleman in those parts
(which were men, if any, to perform it) that I durst wish to be made
acquainted with the matter before hand.

Finally, our conclusion was, that I should inform him of the Havens as
particularly as I could: and within few days after, finding by him that the
force intended hither, was far inferior to that I spoke of, and that there
was some different between the Pope and the king of Spain for the charge, I
told him that the surest course and of least danger were, to send a supply
into Scotland, where a small force would breed a great alteration, and things
being there established by the good liking of the king, I thought it was in him
by a continual war, and by incursions so to anoy this state, as her Majesty
here should be forced to yield the liberty of the Scottish Queen, and what
should thereupon have been reasonably demanded for the benefit of Catholics
here. And herein I said it would be a great furtherance, if at the same time
some few were landed in Irelande, where, although they abid the same hazard
that the former forces sustained, yet would the charge be so great to her
Majesty, and so great an occasion of dispersing of her forces, as a much less
company then was spoken of first by me, would (being landed here in a
convenient place) shake the minds of men generally, and be of force (if any
thing) to draw them to show themselves, in the furtherance of the purpose.

He utterly rejected the purpose for Ireland, and disliked not the purpose for
Scotland: but still he was in mind to have forces landed here, and therefore
desired me very earnestly to inquire particularly of the Haue^s on the side of
Cumberland and Lancashire, and what men were dwelling there that were well
affected in religion, and what places easy to be taken, and what apt for
fortification.

The next time that I went to the Spanish Ambassador, he found himself a
grieved that he understood matters were determined in France without his
priuitie: and told me that Parsons the Jesuit was gone to Rome, sent as he
thought, to understand the Popes mind.

Soon after came over my brother Thomas, to make an end of our account, and
to persuade me to come over, assuring me that for ought he could see in
likelihood, the enterprise was never like to take effect. In the time of his
being here; and while I entertained intelligence with the Scottish Queen
concerning her liberty, the Spanish Ambassador sent for me, and told me of
the coming over of Mope to view Sussex and the Havens, and as he thought, to
taste the best of account there: whereat he seemed to be agrieued, for that
such matters had not been left to him, being one that they in France made
believe that they relied upon principally in this enterprise. Afterward, the
Ambassador told me, that it was Charles Paget, and that he was returned, but
where he had been he knew not, and at the same time I received a letter from
Morgan, that it was Paget: but assuring me, and so willed me to assure the
Ambassador, that his coming was not to move any man, but only to view the
country, for that the moving of any man was referred to him. I did so: and he
entreated me to remember him for those foresaid names and Havens, saying that
so it were done exactly by the Spring, it would suffice: for that sooner he saw
no likeliehoode of the execution of the enterprise.

My brother having made an end of his account with me, returned with this
resolution between us, (I protest before God,) ye if the enterprise succeeded
not between this and the next Spring now past, that I would fettle my things
here and go over. And for this cause, he being gone, I went down into the
country, both to fell and take order for my land in those parts, as also to
setch the draught of Gentlemen and Havens for the most part of England, which
had been set down by me above two years since, and left behind me at
Feckenham in my Study.

Not finding the draught at Feckenham, I returned to London, where I found the
note of names in Secretary hand, which I carried to the Spanish Ambassador,
and there drew that other in Roman hand in his Study, putting down Chester
to be taken, in respect of the eafinesse as I thought, and the rather to give
him encouragement in the matter. I left it with him, promising him that by the
next spring I would perfect it, if I tarried so long, making known unto him,
that I was had in suspicion, and my determination to be gone: but he pressed
the contrary of me, assuring me, that if the enterprise proceeded not, he
would then also depart.

Whether Sir Frauncis Englefielde were a dealer in this practice or no, I know
not: but sure I am (for so the Spanish Ambassador told me) that Sir Frauncis
had intelligence with the said Ambassador all the time of his being here.

The Spanish Ambassador told me that he heard the people of Northwales were
generally well affected, and therefore he desired to have the havens of that
country: I told him that hereafter I would help him thereunto, although no
good might be expected there, for the reasons by me set down in my first
confession; and hereupon the day before mine apprehension, the Ambassador sent
me back the said paper in Roman hand, desiring me to set down the same at my
leisure more exactly, which was the cause that it was not in my green velvet
Casket. The writings in my Casket were sireh as were by me confessed, and came
unto my hands as I have confessed.

I Most humbly beseech her most excellent Majesty, that the extremity which
I have already sustained, and the causes by me discovered, to the safety of
her Majesty and the state, not made known (as has appeared) by any other
mean then by my self, may crave at her hands, the extending of her gracious
commiseration toward the relieuing of the lamentable estate of me, her
Majesty's poor distressed subject, and mine, if God for mine offenses forbid
not the same.

Now judge all ye, that be not peruersly affected, whether Throckemorton be
justly condemned, and whether his confessions (though as he pretended,
extorted from him by violence) be of force in Law against him: he has
conspired to overthrow the state: to bring in strangers to invade the Realm:
to remove her Majesty from her lawful and natural right and inheritance to
the Crown of England, and to place a stranger in her seat: but this last
point, for placing of a stranger, will (perchance) be denied: then note, that
in the whole course of the practice, the greatest bar to the prosecution of
the enterprise, was, they found no way how to put the Scottish Queen in
safety. Then, if these dangerous treasons be discovered by torture, (the only
means left unto Princes to discover treasons and attemptes against their
States and Persons, where they find apparent matter to induce suspicion, as in
the case of Throckemorton, upon sight of the plottes of havens etc.) may the
Law touch the traitor or not? If any man hold this question negatiuely, hold
him for a friend to traitors and treasons, and an enemy to the Queens
Majesty, whom God long preserve, and confound her enemies.

FINIS.
