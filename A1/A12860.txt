or wyser. How know the superlatyf degree for he passes his posityf with this
aduerbe most / and his english ends in est / as most wise or wysest.

what nownes receive co^paryson / such nownes adiectyfes yt may be made more
or less / as fair fayrer fairest Of whom shall ye posytyf degree be fourmed /
he is not fourmed but all other degrees of co^paryson be^ fourmed of him. Of
whom shall the co^paratyfe degree be fourmed / of his posytyf: of what case /
sometime of ye genytyf and sometime of ye datyf. wha^ shall it be fourmed of the

The comparatyf degree shall be fourmed of the datyf case / evermore when his
posytyf degree is the third de clenson / by putting this termynacyon or / as
nominati uo hic et hec et hoc felix / gto^ felicis / dto^ felici / put thereto

this word dextero yt fourmeth the superlatyf degree in rimus / as nuperimus
veterimus maturimus and dexterimus.

with all cases that his posytyues may while theye be of one part of reason.

Quam vult structuram gradus offerri sibi primus
