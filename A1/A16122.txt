Academiae Cantabrigiensis Liber



Seeing that all persons can not read or understand all books / to the^tent
that every man may know whate is the foundacyon of all the scriptures / and
whate thing they do teach us. I have shortly compyled in this present book /
the foundacyon and the sum of the holy scripture of the which the head and
princypall is the faith ^from whom proceed hope and charity. To the intent that
every man may know / whate he shall beleve / whate he shall hope / and why he
shall love god / and how god is our father / and we his children / and how
that we be enheriters of the kingdom of god / as shewith unto us saint Paul in
all his epistles / in diverse chapters^ / which be many times alleged / and
recyted / in this present book. Also how that without our merits we be
justified to the intent that we should not put our trust in our good works / as
did the Iues. Nevertheless albeit that I write in this book that God
justifies us with out our good works and merits / it is not mine intent to
discounsell any man to do good works / but mine euient is to teache all
persons how they shall do the works / and that they shall not trust upon
their good works / nor in them to seek their hel^^^* but all only in the
feith of Jesus Christ / and in the grace of god.

This faith had Abraham / as writes saint Paul unto the Romans. To. 4.
For Abraham beleved against hope in hope. That is to say / that which by
man's nature and virtue was impossible he beleved always hit should come to
pass / evyn as god had promised them. So must every christen lyve ageinste
hope in hope / that is to sey / hit behooves that he repute all his good works
for sin / and think that if god would judge him according to his works he
might not be saved. For if I have done any good hit is of God / and not of me /
for. I have done it by the grace of God / and thereby I deserve no reward And if
I have done any thing of my silfe without the grace of god / hit is ypochrisye
and great sin / and thereby I deserve everlasting death / wherefore then shall
I trust in my good works / for I have no good works / all my goodness
belongs to god. So should a christian humble him silfe and repute all his good
works for sin as truly they be As shows unto us Esaye saying / all our
righteousness be as a clothe polluted with the flowers af a woman. Esa. 64*
And when the person so distrusteth of him silfe / and of his good works he
shall hope again against hope / and shall trust in the mercy of God / and shall
beleve forth on certainly that he shall be saved because of the word of God. For
god has promised to us his realm to all them / that trust in him / and god
is faithful and veritable in his words / wherefore seeing that god has
promised it unto us* let us beleve it stebfastly / and have ferme faith that we
shall be saved not by our deserving / but by the promyses of god. And so it
behooves that every christen dispere and hope (as did Abraham) dispeyre of him
silfe / and then a new to trust in the word of god. And these be the two
things which the law and the gospel does. The law makes us to dispeyre /
because that we never fulfill the commandments of god* These gospel (that
is to say the grace of the new testament / makes us again certeynly to hope
and to trust. And for to teach these two things be written all the cript^res.
The parson shall alweyes abide^^ humylyte and alweyes think that if god would
judge him according to his works he should never come unto health. As shows
unto us Jesus christ in. Lu. 17
S. Kuke sayng / when ye have done all the things which to you are commanded
say ye / we be vnprousitable servauntes / we have done but our duty. And this
is the verey Christen humylite / as in this present book shall be more pleynly
declared And if we can thus repute all our good works for sin / and in
them to have no manner of trust and then ageyn beleve that we shall be saved by
the promyses of god / we be the children of Abraham / of whom all the
scriptures bear witness that by his faith he was justified / and gat health.
And for that cause he is called the father of belevers and of the feithfull.
And this is the faith whereof I write here i^ this book to the intent that all
parsones might come to knowledge and know whate is the Christen says. Of the
which all the scriptures do speak / and namely the Gospel after S. John /
and the epistles of S. Paul / for heryn do these two apostles comprehend all
other scripture.

And for because that it behooves that the parson beleve that his faith
justifies him / and not his works I have shortly compyled here and declared
how the faith does justify us / and how we be the children of God / and how
we must serve our father by charity / and how that we shall nothing doubt of
our health because of the words of God. And when a parson gets this hope he
learneth to bear pacyenly all tribulacyon and adversite. For he knows that
this life is not his life / and has great desire aftrr the other life / and
holds not this life for his. And this makes the faith the which is always
affectuously attendaunte after Christ our espouse. But he that has not this
faith is all desolate when he has mysfortune / and if to him yt happon well he
gyveth him silfe to voluptuosite and sin. And for because he has no hope of
the everlasting life he thinks in him silf I will use this life as long as it
is le^t me / And that he does because he knows not whate our feith is / and
whate our hope is / and how that we be the children, of God.

To the intent therefore that none give him silfe to sin by desperacion I have
shortly compyled in this present book / how that we be justified with out our
merits. For when any parson has done his best with all his power / as I have
said / then let him say yet / that he is an vnproufitable servaunt. And the
humble her te whereby he knowlegith his imperfection makes that his sins /
his evell thoughts and the fragilite of his flesh to him be pardoned of god
and that little that he has / god gyveth it him of him silfe / and god is his
justice / that is to say / god makes him rightuous, for Jesus christ has
satisfied for us unto his heve^ly father / for to come in socoure to our
infirmite. And this describes saint Paul in his first.viij. chapters unto the
Romans / and in the first epistle unto the Corinthyans / and saint John in the
second chaptre of his first epistle. And of this matter treats this present
book.

The last part of this book shows how all estates should lyve / if they will
lyve according to the gospel. Mine intent is not to refourme all estates
as well espirituell as seculer. For of that I will not presume. But I show
alonely by the scriptures how we should lyve if we would lyve according to the
gospel / to thinte^t that every man may know / how far his life is
separate from the doctrine of Jesus christ / and that then with the grace of god
he may amend and refourme his life him silfe.

Nether teach I / that one should not obey unto the superiors (...) but I
teach them by whate mean they shall know how they should lyve / and when
they do not so lyve that then they knowledge their defautes / and do diligence
so to lyve. For else were better before god an humble publican then an holy
ypocrite for God regards not wh^te thing thou do outwardly / but how
thou art ordained and disposed inwardly. (...)

Of the foundation of Christendom and first whate thing the baptesme does
signifye
THe foundacio^ of Christendom is the faith which so few people have
perfectli And yet allweyes we think all that we have the verey true faith.
Saint Paul the worthy apostell does exhort us to no virtue so strongly as unto
the faith. And he in all his epistles ^^ayseth nothing so much as the faith.
Therefore it must needs be that it be a precious vertue^ / for he writes not
one epistle which is not full of faith. We take the faith for the beginnynge of
christen life: but truly he that has parfaith faith the same has not only
begone the christen life / but has fulfilled it. And this error comith
because we know not whate the faith is / nor whate thing a good christian ought
to beleve / for to be saved* we think that when we be baptized / and when we
beleve that god is god that the^ we shall be saved. Mar. 19
As writes. S. Mark sayi^g. He that shall beleve and shall be baptized shall be
saved. But he that beleveth not shall be co^de^pned. It is truth / but among a
thousand there is not one that knows whate thing the baptesme betokens nor
whate thing he shall beleve.

The water of baptesme takes not away our sin for then it were a precious
water* And then it beloved us daily to ^ass^e us the^i. Nether has the water
of the font any more virtue in her silf the^ the water that rynneth in the
river of Ryne. Act. 8
For we may as well baptyse in Ryne / as in the font. When saint Phillip
baptized Eunuchus the servaunt of Candace a queen of Ethyope (as writes saint
Luke in the acts of thappostles) there was then no hallowed water / nor candell
/ nor salt / nor cream nether white abite / but he baptized him in the first
water they came to upon the way. Hereby may thou perceyve that the virtue of
baptesme lies not ^n hallowed water or in other outward thiges that we have at
the font^ but in the faith (...) to sey when any parsone (...) he must beleve
steadfastly that his (...) to him ar pardoned and that he is made the child of
God and that god is become his father / and y^ made certain that he shall be
saved. And is made parttaker of the passion of Christ whereof the baptesme has
his virtue.

And when one is baptized he is borne again / and gets an other father / and
other brethren for God is made his father / and he is made the brother of
Jesus Christ: as writes Saint Paul unto the Romans where he calls. Christ
a son first begotten among other. To. 8.
And therefore is Christ called in the holy scripture the son first begotten /
for he is the first child of his father / and we all are begotten afterward
when we be baptized. And therefore is the baptesme called in the holy scripture
the second nati^^te. John. 3
As writes saint John in his gospel. without one be borne ageyn (says Christ
unto Nicodemus) he may not ^ntre into the kingdom of heven. For we be thereby
borne again / and they that were the children of the devell because of the
original sin are made the children of God by baptesme. As says Saint Paul
Christ has healed us by the bath of regeneracyon and renovacyon of the holy
ghost. Ephe. 2
And unto the Ephesyans* we were by nature the children of wrath: but when we
were deed Christ has viuified us again by his great love / And this shall
thou understand in this manner.

There were sumtyme.ij. Adams / as writes saint Paul. The first Ada^ was our
first father. The second and new Adam was Jesus Christ. For the sin of the
old Adam we were all children of the devell made his own and subjected unto
him by our sin. The second Adam (that is to sey Jesus Christ) has bought
us again / and has put us in liberty / and has made us of the children of
death / children of everlastynge life, and of the children of wrath children of
grace: For Jesus Christ has by his death foughe ageynste the devell has
vaynquysshed the devell / and death / and has taken away all their right they
had over us.

Now then when we be baptized we be made partakers of this grace / and so is
it come to our proufit that Jesus christ dyed for us. For (as I have now
said) the baptism has his virtue of the death of Jesus christ. Then when we be
baptized / we betoken that we will dye with Christ / we betoken / I say / that
we will dye as unto the life passed as touching our sins and evil
concupiscences: and that / as says. S. Paul / we must walk in a new life.
To. 6
And therefore be we plonged under the water: to the intent that by the manner of
spekinge / we should be here deed and buried / as writes saint Paul unto the
Romans To. 6.
Brethren / says he / Esteem ye that ye are deed as concerning sin but
alyde unto god: by Jesus christ our lord. And in the same place: Ye are buried
with Christ by baptesme into death. So that we shall not lyve after the life of
the world nor after the life of the flesh but we must lyve as the children of
god. And our life shall be hyd before the world and also hyd with Christ in god
/ as writes saint Paul saying: Col. 3
If ye be mortified and your life is hyd with Jesus christ i^ god in whate time
that Jesus christ our life shall show him silf then also shall ye be made
manifest with him in glory. Then when our lord shall come again at the last day
of judgment our life shall be made open: but as long as we lyve here we must
learn all to dye* For we shall not repute this life that we have here for a
life.

This life here is of the world and of worldly things that is to sey of them
/ that be estraungers to God that have no trust of the other life to come.
Nether do they look for it nor desire it. Such people joy of this world / for
the world with his vain desires and plesaunces belongs to them. John. 15.
and, 16.
And they them silves be also called the world in the holy scripture. As
says our lord Christ in saint John. You be not of the world / but I have
chosen you from the world. And again. The world shall be ioyons and you shall be
sorry: Now call we all them worldy which be not monks. Our lord made a
distinction between the world and his disciples before the monks came into the
world. Wherefore they be not called the world in holy scripture which be not
monks: but all those that lyve after the flesh which desire not here to dye
with Jesus christ / and to be hydden here after to lyve with God. All such
whatesoever they be are worldly be he monk or chanone / nun or Sister /
nobill or unnoble great or small. For (as I have said) the life of them
which apperteyn to God is here hyd / and they seem to be deed before the
world. For they lyve not comunely according to the life of the world. And
therefore they be hated of the world / for they be not of the world / as says
the Gospel in this manner. They be not of the world / for if they were of the
world / the world surely would love them as his own. John. 15.
But for as much as they (according to their promise made at the font of
baptesme) do apply them silves to renounce the pleasures of the world and to
dye with christ in killing of the desires of the flesh / and also are
strongly against the appetites of the flesh in other by ensaumple of their
good lyving therefore be they persecuted of the world.

And hereby may we alweyes know the disciples and children of God: if they
love to gyther the one the other. And y^ they lyve not here after the life of
the world nor after the pleasure of the flesh / and if they do not repute
this life for a life / but abide with a joyful heart the coming of our lord
Jesus christ. Then shall their life be made open / and shall appear before God.

So should we all lyve here / as though this life were not our life. For we
must abide our life before God / and we may do none other thing in this life
but fight. Against our evell desires / and learn to dye (for as the prophet
Job says) the life of man is a battle upon earth / that is to say a battle
in a goostly death. Job. 2
And this do we promise to do when we be baptized / and we signify eve^ the
same / when we be plonged under the water.

Whate thing the baptesme betokens / and how it is but a sign. Chaptre. ij.
THen when we be baptized yt behooves us to know surely and to beleve that all
our sins to us are pardoned and that we be made the children of god. For god
is bycome our father / and Jesus christ our brother. And that same right that
Jesus christ has unto the glory of his father / have we also gotten / for the
brethren have egall right unto their fathers goods. And this have we not
gotten by our good works / for we have yet done no good: when we were
baptized But this comyth holly by the grace of god and by our faith / by that
we put our hole trust in him / and that we knowledge hi^ for our lord and
savionre. And that we beleve all that he has done and suffered for us. for he
dyed to make us to lyve. ^Cor. 8
He became little and poer to make us great and rich. As says Saint Paul in
this manner ye know the liberalite of our lord Christ / which though he were
rich / yet for your sakes became poor: that ye through his povertye might be
made rich / for Jesus christ is holly gyven to us of his father / to the intent
that he should make us great rich and happy by his death For we could not
help our silves and therefore he was borne for us. As says Esaie A child is
borne to us. Esa. ^
For we were all egally dettours / and bound to god / by the sin of Adam.

Then when we could not help our silves / for asmoche as we were servauntes
and subjects unto the devell / god has gyven to us.ij. no table gifts / and
has done.ij. things for the love that he has unto us. First that he has
bought us and made us fre from the devil / and from our sins. Secondly that
he has made us his children and heriters of his glory / and that all without
our deserving. As said before the prophet. Esaye saying. Esa. ^
The iniquyte of Jerusalem (that is to say of the man seeing by faith peace in
Jesus Christ) to him is pardoned / and he has receyved of the hond of the lord
god twyce as much for all his sins. Zacha^
And the prophet Zachary says also. Turn you unto defense / I will gyve you
double^ as much. In the which places these.ij. Prophets say that for our
sins / for the which we have deserved dampnacyon / we have receyved of
God.ij. gifts. And therefore is there issued out of the side of Jesus Christ.ij.
fontaygnes / that is to say blood and water. By his blood he has bought us
again from the devell. By the water he has washed and purged us which were
defiled and (...).) For to offer us pure and clean unto his father. As says
Saint Paul unto the Ephesyans. ^phe. 5
He has gyven him silfe for us an offering / and a sacryfice of a sweet
savoure to god. And the water of the font does now betoken the water of the
side of Jesus christ In this water be we purged and sanctified by our faith /
to the intent that we should come pure and clean before God / the father which
has receyved us for his children / and has made us enheritours of his glory
/ with his son Jesus christ our brother. And this is the grace the which
comyth to us and is gyven at the font of baptesme.

But to the intent that we should not be unkind / therefore for this grace we do
bind our silves ageyn and yield us unto him / promysing that we will serve
him / and deny the devell / and all his temptacion / po^pe / and counsel /
and that we will serve Christ crucified for us / and upon this promise receyve
we our name / and god has written us as in a roll for his Champyons and
servauntes / and so be we made propre to god. For he is our father / and we be
his children.

This baptesme was figured unto us when the children of Israel went thorough
the red see out of Egypt / and Exo. 1^
when Pharo with all his company was drowned in the sea. The children of
Israel went in the sea all as though they had gone into death. But for because
they beleved unto Moses / they passed the water by their faith. And be (after
the manner of spekinge) gone out of the death into life. when they has gotten on
the other side / on land Pharo followed them / and so was drowned with his
people. So does everyone upon the font when he is baptized. First he fle^th
from Pharo / when he begins for to knowledge his subjection / and bondage by
the which he was subject and servaunt unto the devell / and when he desires to
be enfraunchised from his sin / and from Pharo that is the devell But he may
not escape from Pharo without passing through the red see / that is to say /
he may not escape from the devell without he must be baptized. And for because
that the children of Israel when they saw that Pharo followed them beleved
god / therefore upon that faith in god / they be entered into the sea / as though
they were gone into death. But by the mean of three faith / they have passed the
water and are gone as from the death unto life.

So if any man will escape from the ho^des of the devil it behooves him to
enter into the water. He enters therein / as though he e^tred into the death /
for he promyseth that he will dye as concerning all his evell desires / and
that he will here lyve before the world as though he were deed (that is to
say) that he will not live as the world lyveth / but will hyde and cover his
life with god. And so enter we by faith into the font (that is to^ say) by
faith we enterprise to enter into the death / not into corporal death / but into
the death of sin / no more willing to lyve in sin. And yet all be it that it
seem to us a pleasant thing to lyve in sin / and that we think yt an hard
thing / thus to enter into the sea (that is to sey / into this death / we take
always courage / and beleve and trust in the pnissaunce and goodness of God /
and so enter we into the sea (that is to sey) into this espirituell death / and
we enterprise and promise to dye as concerning our sins. And as by a
steadfast faith and trust we dare begin to enter / so gyveth God unto us grace
and streyngth to pass through that see / that is to say / through this
espirituell death / and to come on land on the other side (that is) unto the
everlasting life. Pharo (that is to sey) the devil with our sins pursue us.
but they drown them silves in the water (that is to sey) the power of the
devil and of all our sins perisshe when we enter into the water with such
a feith.

When Pharo was deed then song the children of Israel / and thanked god /
that they were arryved a land out of the water / as out of the death. So
likewise must every christen / when out of this water / that is to say / out of
this espirituell death he comyth unto life / that is to sey / when he dies he
shall thank and preyse God because he has brought him out of such a danger
/ unto the health of everlasting life. But as long as he is yet here in this
world / he shall be in the deeth / that is to say / he shall alweyes dye
spiritually / and his life shall be hydden before the world with God. Here may
thou well see how that our baptesme is signified by the red see / as writes
saint Paul unto the Corinthyans saying. 1. Cor. 10
Our fathers were all under a cloud / and did pass the sea all and were all
baptized in Moses / in the cloud / and in the sea / and they all did eat one
spirituell meat / and they all did drink one spirituell drink. So see thou
well whate thing ^ignifieth the baptesme / and whate thing we promise in the
same.

Now: to the intent that we should be alweyes remembryng of this that we have
promised we be merked with a cross / and with that water. The faith that we
have at the baptesme takes away our sins / and the water is nothing but a
sign or token / where with we be merked that we must be under the standard /
that is to sey under the cross of Jesus Christ / and valiauntly fight. As the
Iues had the token of the circumcision / whereby men might know whether they
were Iues or ^aynyms. And as when the servauntes of the lords bear the badge
of their lords / one may thereby know whose servauntes they be. So like wise
receyve we the sign of baptesme at the font / by the which we gyve knowledge
that Christ is our lord.

Secondly / the baptesme of the water is also a sign of the grace of God.
whereby God makes us sure / that we shall enjoy his grace and mercy / and that
he pardons us our sins / and makes us his children. Here upon gyveth he
to us the token of Baptesme for a gage / to thyntent that we should be sure /
that he will not forsake us in our battle and deeth / which we lead here in
our evyll desires and sins. And that he will surely gyve to us the
everlasting life. And to the intent the^ that we should enterprise by a steadfast
constance to fight / being assured and certain that god will never forsake us /
for we have ^^^ceyved of him a gage the token of baptesme. And if it happon
that we mysse sum^tyme in the red see (that is to sey) in the entrepryse of
our battle / and that (...) doubt / or that our bataile seem to us (...)
hard and bitter / we shall behold our sig^ne and gage which we have
receyved (...) god / whereby he has promised us (...) we be his children / and
that he will not (...) us.

So say I then that by pure faith at^ our sins be to us pardoned / and that
(...) be the children of god / and that we belon^ to god / and that god shall
show over (...) his mercy. Here upon receave we a (...) that is the sign of
baptesme to thi^te^t tha^ as often as we have regard unto this sign / we should
be myndefull of the grace (...) mercy that god has done unto us / and tha^ we
belong to god / and that we be the chil^ren of god.

Behold now thou see well wha^ thing the baptesme betokens / and it is
(...) one before god if thou be.lxxx. year old^ or twenty year old when thou
receav^ the baptesme / for god regards not hou^ thou art / but with whate
purpose and ^tencyon / and with whate feith thou re^avest this baptesme and
grace. He regar^^th not whether thou be Iue / or payny^e / man or woman / noble
or unnoble / bis^^ope or cytezyn. But alonly he that with (...) parfait faith
and trust comyth unto god (...) makes violence unto the everlasting (...) and
Mat. 26.
gets it as promyseth Jesus christ (...) the gospel.

Whate thing we promise at the Baptesme and whate professyon we make. Chaptre.
iij.
WHen one warns these / worldly people to do any good / they say / let the
monks and religious do it / which have promy^ed it / as though they were not
bound to (...) the doctrine of Jesus christ / or as though they had nothing
promised. All be it that no monk can promise more then he ^ath promised at the
baptesme.

And we be much more bound unto (...) promise made at the baptesme / then
(...) any religious unto his professyon. For we make no promise unto man / but
unto god / and we promise not to kept the rule of a man but of the gospel.
Think ye no^ therefore that it is a small thing to be a christen / when thou
have promised to Jesus christ to amend thy life / ad that thou (...) not live
according to the world / nor aco^ding to the flesh. It is a great thing
(...) enterprise the Christen faith / which (...) few people do know whate
thing it co^teyneth / namely such as here after (...) world do seem to be
verey wise and lettered.

But one might say I have nothing promised to God / I was a child / let him
keep it that has promised for me. For this cause to the intent that no man
should so say / it was sumtyme ordained that none should be baptized before
that he cam^ to understanding and knowledge / to the intent that he might promise
him ^ilfe / and forsake the devell / and that he might know what thing he had
promised If it were not that the children were feeble and in peril of death the^
they must have bin baptized.

Now alweyes albeit that we our silfe have not promised we be allegally
bound to observe it. For if thou had dyed when thou were but a year old /
thou had dest also be saved, thou will say ye / by the ^aith of my godfathers
and godmothers / and (...) holy church. I say ageyn. do thou ^fesse that
the faith of thy godfathers and ^odmothers is so mighty that thou may ^erby
be saved. The same feith is likewi^^ mighty to subject the and bind the to
that (...) that they have promised for the (...) pain of thy da^pnacio^ / and
loss of thy (...). wherefore thou must as well keep this that thy pare^tes have
promised for the / as though thou had promised it thy silfe. The godfathers
and godmothers be bound (...) warn the children / and to help them that ^hey
be put to stole / to the intent that they ^ay understood the gospel the joyful
mes^age of god with the epistles of. S. Paul For the unlettered and simple
people be as ^ell bound to know the^ as the lettered and (...). And god has
commanded for to pub^^she and to show the gospel not allonly to ^restes /
but also unto every creature. Go ^e says Christ unto his disciples / into the
^niuersal world / and preche the gospel to every creature, Mar. 16
for we be all egally bound to ^now the gospel and the doctrine of the new
testament / and saint Paul has not allo^ly ^^rite^ his pistles unto the
prestes / but also Citezyns and householders. And this witnessith saint Paul
him silfe writing unto the Corinthians and unto the Galathians: ^Cor. 1
where he confesses that he sends his epistles to all the church / that is
to sey to all thassemble of Christen men / and to all them that call on the
name of Jesus. And unto the Romans he says: To you all that be at Rome the
friends of god. To. 1.
And Jesus Christ has as well suffered death for the common householder / as for
the prestes. God shall always require the scriptures of the prestes / for they
be ydell and do not study / nor make no diligence to declare them unto the
simple.

Therefore it is very needful that the common people should understand the
gospel and the doctrine of the apostles according to the lettre / and that
they know the^ by heart with the other stories of the old testament / for so
should they more lightly understand the preachers.

It were also very necessary that every one did learn his children to read as
men were wont to do before time. The Iues had their law in Hebrew / the which
every one might understand according to the lettre. After this the paynems
were converted by saint Paul / to whom he wrote-in greek / which they all
did vndstond. After that was Italy and affryque converted where as well the
wymen as the men spoke latin / and for this cause was the bible translated into
latin to the intent that every one might understand it / and they preached in
latin / and the prophets were read in the Italien churches in latin. And in
that time there were many ladies and wymen / which understood verey well the
scriptures / as was Paul^ and Eustochium Demetrias and Marcella ^ many other /
of whom w^iteth saint Iherome / and the comune householders read the bible in
their houses with their children. So is it now of great necessite that the
holy scripture be translated into all langages / or that all the children learn
the latin tongue.

Some man would sey every man may not set his children to s^ole because they be
poor, wherefore I would well that the children of the pore were hold to scole
at thexpences of the comynaltye / or that folks should take the money which
they spend so outragio^^ly in making and gilding of images / and in dressing
the aultres of the churches / and in buylding of Monasteris Chanonryes and
chapels and founding of Obites and prebendes. Or of the money that men offer in
churches / and of the which men make vessels of gold and silver and other
precious ornaments. They might enploy this money a thousand fold better / if
there with they did hold these young children to scole / till such time that
they cord read well. For (alas) ye shall find thousands of ancient
persons that can not sey the pater noster and Creed in their mother tongue /
and of them that say it in latin are many that wot not whate they sey / nor
know not of never an article of the faith. Wherefore I say that it is expedient
for the christen to set all their children to skole till they can read and
understand the holy scriptures namely when they be wryte^ in their mother
tongue. And then they that had not wit and understanding worthy to be
continued at scole / should be caused to learn an occupacion. If they did thus
they should bring into the world double prou^fit. First we should not have
such a great nombre of prestes and monks unlettered and knowing nothing in
the christen church. For now there are made many prestes / monks and freres
/ that for lack of litterature are nothing co^venie^t for that office. By the
unlettered prestes is this great error comen into the world / that is / that
in the stead of the pure scriptures which is the lyvely word of God / which
they know not / they preche narracions fables lies and tradicions of the
invencio^ of the yppochrites / that (alas) the faithful trust and honor
which belongs to gods word / they cause the people to gyve to their fables
and lies.

Secondly it would proufit, for if every body went so long to skole / they
should understood more lightly the prechers / and if they the^ silves / had
read the stories or the Gospel after the letre / then they might reherce to
their children and servau^tes / i^ doing of their business / some thing of the
gospel of the stories or of the scripture / i^stede of vain fables / ydell
words / and vncouenabill matters which they speak the one to the other. As we
se su^tyme now a days / that fellows of one crast which have bin at scole /
sing many times the song in doing their bussynesse / which they have learned
to sing at the scole or at the church / and the other vileyn songs / for they
have learned none other thing.

Whate thing is the Christen faith / and whate thing one ought to beleve to
have health. Chaptre. iiij.
I Have said at the beginning that the foundation of Christendom is the faith
which so few people have: and understand not whate the faith is, we think
that when we beleve that god is god / and can our creed that we have the faith
that a Christen is bound to have. The devell beleveth also that there is a God
/ and one life everlasting and one hell / but he is never the better for it. Ye
and he trembles always for this feith / as faith saint James. Iam. 2.
The devels beleve and they tremble.

Some man might axe whate shall I the^ beleve. Thou shall beleve then first
plainly and undoubtedly that the father / the son / and the holy ghost / is one
only god^ And this thou shall not desire to understand how / nor busy thy
silfe much therein: for this is not the principal that we must beleve: Our
faith lies not principally therein. For this likewise beleve the wicked sprites
as is said before and are nothing the better therefore. There is yet an other
feith which Christ so much requires of us in the gospel / and where unto
also saint Paul almost in all his epistles so strongly exhorts us. That is
that we must first beleve the gospel, when our lord began first to preach
he said (as reherseth saint Mark) have repentance and beleve in the gospel.
Mar. 1.


Thou may axe me / whate thing is the gospel? Hit is a good and joyful
message or glad tydinges. For it is news of the favor / grace / mercy / and
goodness of god toward us. It is (I sey) tydinges that god has taken us to
mercy / and therefore song the angels when Christ was borne (as reherseth
saint Luke) Lu. ^
I show unto you great joy / for this day is borne your savioure which is
Christ the lord In this gospel that is to sey in this message we beleve
certainly that god the father has sent hither his son / for to bye us again
to enfraunchise us / and to deliver us from the devel to whom we were made
subjects and servauntes / by the sin of our fore father, we could not help
ou^ silves / because we were servauntes and b^nde. None of us was abill to
satisfy for us For we were all like wise subjected, as says Saint Paul unto
the Romans. To. 3.
They have all sinned and have need to the grace of god. It was needful then
that he that should satisfy for us should be without sin without subjection
or obligacion. And no such patron or mediator was there found in the world.
The^ this one thing was of necessite that other we must abide lost for ever /
or it behoved that god should be made man. So has our god almighty had pitye
and compassion on us by the great love that he had toward us and has sent his
only son Jesus christ. Hiere. 31
As writes the prophet Hieremye saing: I have loved them a-perpetuell charity
/ therefore I have drawn the having mercy. He has sent him to the intent / that
b^ his death which he had not deserved / he might appayse God and satisfy him
for us. Co^. 5
As writes saint Paul. All is of God / which has reconcilyed us unto him by
christ. Then is Christ made a mediator between god and man and has offered him
silfe an oblacion for us to his father / whereby he has reconsiled us again and
made our peace. And for because the devell did set his hand upon Christ to
whom he had no right he has so lost all his right which he had over us. And
so are we delivered from the servitude and subjection of the devell / and
belong unto Christ. And by that that the son of god is now made man / he is
also made our brother. And if we be his brethren / we be also enheriters with
him of the glory of his father. To. 8.
As writes saint Paul unto the Romayne / saying. If we be children we be also
heirs with Christ. And we have as much and as great right to heven as Jesus
Christ him silfe. For christ is a son of God / so be we / reserved / that he
is a son natural / and was for ever without beginning the son of God. But
we be the children of God allonly by the goodness and grace of God / which he
has done to us, as says Saint Paul. Ephe. 1.
He has predestinate us into an election of the children of God. Then is it
this comen to pass / that we must beleve surely / that we be the children of
god / and that god is our father.

Secondly thou shall steadfastly beleve the words of god / that is to sey /
that all that god has seyde shall come to pass and be done / without any
f^lse. ^ene. 17 and. 2^
As did the faithful Abraham which when god had promised to him (a thing
impossible in all man's reason) that he should have a son of his baraine
wife Sara / of whom kings of the people should arise / and that in his sede all
people should be blessed (all be it that it was a thing against nature that a
woman of four score and ten years old should conceyve and bear a child)
beleved vndoughtedly / and as the child was borne god as ^^rforth as could
appear unto man's judgment / working clean contrary to his promise /
commanded that he should s^e him and make sacrifice of him. Abraham albeit
that all carnal wisdom would have persuaded him to have dispeyred in the
promise / never douted / was all ready to do it / beleving steadfastly that it
should rather be possible / that his son should rise again from death / rather
then the word and promise of god should not be true. So steadfast and so
certain must we stand unto the word of god / ye and although it were so /
that all men angels and devels would persuade us to the contrary / we must
beleve surely that the word of god is true / and that he will fulfill all that
he has promised.

Whate thing has god promised us? Ma.^ 4 Mar. 16
he has promised us his everlasting life / saying: repent the kingdom of
heven is at hand. Mar. 16
And in an other place: whosoever shall beleve and be baptized shall be saved
He has also promised unto us remission of all our sins / as said saint
Peter speking of Christ to Cornelius the centurion To him (said he) Act. 10
gyveth all the prophets witness / that through his name shall receyve
remission of sins all that beleve in him / that is to sey / that al they that
with entyre courage forsake they m self and put all there trust in the grace
and mercy of him / shall have remission of all there sins. Moreover he has
promised us that we shall be the children of God / as says saint John. John. 1.
He has gyven to them power to be the children of god / to them that beleve
in his name. All this must we believe steadfastly / all though that we think it
impossibill after our works and sinful life. We must also with a parfa^t
courage put all our trust in god / as did Abraham for as saint Paul writes.
Abraham beleved god and hit was imputed unto him for righteousness. To. 4.
Then when with a parfayt courage / we do so put all our trust in god / and in
his promyses it is unpossible that we should perisshe. For he has promised us
his life everlasting. And for asmoche as he is almightye and may all thing he
may well hold to us that he has promised. And in that that he is merciful and
true he will hold to us his promys if we can beleve it steadfastly / and put
all our trust in him. For as (witho^t our me^tes) he has made us his
children / and heirs upon the font of baptesme / so may he likewise gyve to
us / that thing that he has promised us / if we can only trust in him /
albeit that we have not (...) served it by our works.

Therefore be not discomfort nor yndesperacyon for thy sins though thou have
not deserved by thy good works that god has made the his heir. for as says
saint Paul: By grace are ye saved by faith and that not of your silves. Ephe. 2
And again: It is the gift of god and comes not of works* lest any man should
host him silf. For when we were yet sinners / and before that we have done any
good: Ye when we were yet his enemies he has not spared his own son but (to
make ^s likewise his children and heirs by hi^) To. 8
has delivered him unto death / to make sa^sfaction for our sins / to
purchase us pardon and forgyuenesse to make us one as he is in Christ / and
Christ in him / that John. 17
^o we in god and Christ might be one / that the world may know that he has
loved us as he has loved Christ that there as he is we may be with him that we
may se his glory which he has gyven him because he loved him before the world
began. To. 8.
Here may thou se (if thou can believe it) that it is god that justifies
who is it the^ that shall co^de^pne / who shall ley any sin to the charge of
goddis elect / since christ is ^eed for our sins / and risen ageyn for our
^ustificacio^ which also sits at the right ho^de of god the father and
prays for us.

Behold whate a servent occasion go^ has gyven the to love him / when thou
w^^re yet his enemy. wherefore let no tribulacion / anguysshe / persecucion /
fere / imprisonement / hunger / nakedness / nor swerde^ separate us from the
love of god. Wherfo^re if any would discomfort us (be he aun^gell or devell)
let us not beleve him / (...) the promyses of god may not be distroyed^ If thou
can surely / and steadfastly beleve in god / he will hold his promise. He
has sworn to us / to the intent we should believe him. But if thou beleve him
not / and (...) by thy sins thou come in dispeyre / (...) abides steadfast
in his promise / but tho^ hold not thy faith. As says saint Pa^ul to
Timothe. 2. Timo. 2
A faithful word for if we be ded with him we shall lyve like wys^ with him.
For god has bound him silfe to us: and for because of his promise he ow^th
unto us heven / in case that we beleve him. But if we beleve him not he owes
to us nothing.

Read all the Evangelists thorough^ and ye shall not find that our lord
Jesus christ has so much exhorted us to any^ thing as unto faith / nor that
he has so (...) hated and reproved any thing in his ^^sciples as incredulite.
As it is written in (...) Mathewe in the.xiiij. Chaptre that ^hen saint Petre
went upon the water and doubted. O thou of little faith (said jesus) why
did thou doubt? Also to (...) paralitique (that is to sey a man sike of
(...) paisey) beleve son thy sins be forgy^en the. And unto the woman
laboring (...) a bloody flyxe. Mat. 9
Beleve daughter thy ^^nnes are forgiven the. And unto the fa^^er of the
possessed in the.ix of Mark: If ^^ou could beleve all things are possi^le
unto him that beleveth: and unto thap^ostles which could not cast out the
devel ^om the same possessed: O generation wi^^out faith how long shall I be
with you ^^reby may thou lightly know how ^any times our lord Christ has
repro^ed his disciples of their infidelite. And ^oyses could not bring the
people of If ^ell into the land of promyssion / because (...) gave not the
glory to god / and that he ^egan to doubt of god to the intent that he^^by we
might know that allonly one ^^edfast faith and trust in God may bring (...)
unto the lon^ of promission of the kingdom of heven: As it is written in
De^teronomion. where the prophet Moyse^ says unto the people of Israel.
Thou shall not enter into the land of promission because of thine own
righteousness and the equity of thine heart: but because tha^ god will fulfill
his word w^iche he has promised by oath made unto thy father^ Abraham Isaac
and Jacob. And therefore is it called the land of promission: for that we be
saved that comyth not through (...) good works: but that our god hat^ so
promised. And we must steadfastly and without doubt beleve that god will (...)
power unto his words as far forth a^ with a parfait courage we beleve in
him. For God has bound him silfe unto us and has promised us that he will
gyve us the everlasting life. For he desires nothing but our health. And he
bids us that we shall pray unto him. For he will hei^ us graciously as he
promyseth us in the gospel / saying. And whate soever ye (...) in my name that
will I do. John. 14.
And he is ready at all hours to forgive us our sins when we have
repentance: As says the prophet Ezechiell. Eze. 18.
If the wikked tour^he him silf from his sinful life to righteousness he
shall lyve and not dye: and I will no more have remembrance of thynyquyte that
he has done. And saint Paul unto the Romans. All they that beleve and trust
in him shall not be shamed. And Iohel the proprete as recyteth saint Paul: All
they that shall call on the name of god shall be saved. That is to sey they (that
by a steadfast feyth abide upon god as did the good thief that was crucified
with christ which when he with a steadfast believe had called upon Christ was
answered: this day shall thou be with me in paradize. And as did Mary
magdaleyne to whom it was likewise said / thy faith has saved the goo thou
in peace) shall be saved.

Thirdli we must also beleve that god desiteth none other thing but our health.
and therefore whatesomever thing happo^ to us here be we in health or in disease
/ rich or pore / honored or despised / noble or unnoble / alyve or deed: we
shall alweyes be content whate thing soever god send knowing certeynly that
nothing comith without the will and sufferau^ce of god. for if it so be that one
leefe falls not from the tree and that a sparowe or a fly descend not on the
earth without the will of your father? How much more comith there nothing to
us without the will and suffraunce of god? As writes saint Mathewe / where our
lord says be not.ij. sparowes sold for a penny and none of them does light
on the ground without your father. Then whate soever thing god send us let us
receyve it yeldinge to him thanks with good heart: ^ Mat. 10
as did Abraham which forsook his country and his land as it is written in the
book of Genesi^ where god said to Abraham: go out of thy country and out of thy
lynage / and go into the land that I will show the: which also was ready to
kill his welbeloved son Isaac. Now seeing that we be the children of Abraham /
and that we have obtained health by mean of the says of Abraham. As says our
lord in. S John. If ye be the children of Abraham / do the works of Abraham.
And therefore must we bear all things patiently / and with good will which god
will that we shall suffer and bear. For if he knew that they were not
covenable and proufitable for us / he would let them they should not come as
death / war / pestilence / poverty / malady aduersite / persecucion /
discomfort for our children: loss of our temporal goode^: To. 14.
finally the verey death. For as saint Paul says. whether we lyve or dye we
are alweyes the lords. And therefore the Christen shall not be troubled for
none such things but shall be rather joyful as were thappostles whom god had
made worthy to suffer any thing for his love. For it is a sure token that thou
art the child of god if thou have patience. for it is written by saint. Act. 5.
Luke in thactes of thappostles that thapostles were joyful that they were
reputed worthy to suffer dishonor before the world for the love of god. And
god has promised nothing else to his disciples in this world but pain and
tribulacion: as Christ says in saint John John. 16
Ye shall weep and lament / and the world shall rejoice / and ageyn in the
world ye shall have tribulacion but be of good chere / for I have overcome the
world.

And there is not a more certain sign that a man shall be dampened then when he
ledith here an yvell life and has alweyes prosperity. for this prosperity
shall be his paradise. On the contrary part there is not a more certain sign of
everlasting health then when a man lyveth justly / and has always adversite: for
that is it that god sends us for our sins and our purgatory: or so to
make open his glory in our pacyence. And therefore shall the Christen alweyes
more rejoice when he suffers aduersite and tribulacyon then when all things
comyth prosperously unto him. For prosperity in an evell life signifies
como^ly that god has reproved the parsone. ^ it makes him to forget God. But
adversite signifies commonly that god loves the person: And the parson is
warned by tribulacion and sufferaunce to call upon god for socoure. Hebre. 12
For as seith saint Paul him that God loves him does he chastise: and he
stourgeth every child that he receyveth For whate is the child that the father
does not chastise? And if ye be out of the discipline and chastisement of the
which all the children of god have been part takers / ye are then bastardes and
not sons. And in thapocalips speaks God and says: Apo. 3
as many as I love I rebuke and chastyse. Also Solomon in the Proverbes says:
them that the lord god loves he rebukes. Pro. 3^
Therefore let none be sorry when tribulacio^ / maladye / pestilence / or also
the death it silf comith / But let him alweyes accord his will to the will of
god / and suffer patiently and joyfully knowing for troth / that it is all the
good and holy will of God our right good father. And let him thank him that
it pleases him to make him / worthy to suffer any manner trybulacyon for his
sake as did Job and Thobias / and many other. For without doubt god knows
whate thing is helthfull for us. And he that murmureth and grudgeth ageynste
god in tribulacio^ is not a Christian. For he beleveth not that god governs
and entreatith him for his health. But whate are we ought else the^ earth in the
hond of a potter? As says saint Paul in this manner: To. 9
O man whate art thou that do this murmr against god? may the pot say
unto hi^ that made hi^ why have thou made me on this facio^? Nay. And as the
potter may make such a pot as he will of the earth so be we in the ho^des of
god* and we must be co^te^t with all that god will do with us* for we be his we
live or dye says saint Paul. To. 14.
For this cause he that with a steadfast faith suffers and endures patiently
all things and tribulacions is a christen. And this is the faith and the
steadfast stone upon the which the cristente is founded. For in this doing we
beleve and trust steadfastly that god is our father and that he will not
forsake us: albeit that now he do here chastise us for as I have said there
can be no more certain sign that god loves the. the^ when sorrow and
tribulacion happens unto the. for all the scriptures of the new testament
promise us here nothing but sorrow and sufferaunce.

Of the most certain weye to come to salvacyon. Chaptre. v.
THis must every Christian know that none syns the time of Adam unto this day
has deserved the everlasting life by his good works. And that none by his
good works shall deserve it: Hebre. 7
as writes saint Paul unto the Hebrews. The law has brought nothing unto
perfection. wherefore all they do err that think that then they shall be saved
when they have done many good works. And like wise all they that think that
they shall be dampened when they have done no good. For good works make no man
certain that he shall be saved And he that has done no good is not also certain
that he shall be dampened. The works can gyve no manner certeynte. For the
Pharisey that had done much good which looked for great reward of god was
reproved / and despised. Luke. ^
As writes saint Luke where the pharisey thanked god that he was not as other
were extorcioners / unjust / aduoutrers / nor as the publican was: and bosted
him silf of his good works. And the publican that had done no good and
confessed mekely his sins was of God receyved unto grace, for this cause to
the intent that every man may know that god has no need of our good works for
to save us / with all I will declare here first how we be justified and obtain
health.

First we must know that by the original sin we were made subjects and
servauntes unto the devell / and none in the world might help us for all
mankind was dettoure unto God. And that worse was we did not knowledge our
mysery nor are socoure of god. Then when there was no comfort nor mean to
help us and to deliver us again from the subjection of the devell: Our god
almightye by his great mercy and goodness of him silf has willingly suffered
that his only begotten son Jesus Christ was made mortal man for us to the intent
that by his death which he had not deserved he might by us ageyn and deliver us
from eternal death whereunto we were all subjects. As writes saint Paul
saying. To. 5
If it be so that by the sin of one man (that is to sey of Adam) death has
reigned upon many / much more the grace of god and the gift of grace of one
man Iesuchrist abounds upon many. Ephe. 2
And unto the Ephesians. Blessed be God father of our lord Jesus christ which
has blessed us with a spiritual benediction by his son Christ. Thus is this
grace comen hoelly to us from god of his goodness and not by our merit / or
good works. For we did not knowledge our bondage and subiectyon nor did not
ones desire to be delyvered from our myserye.

Then for asmoche as the devell did se^ hand upon Christ / to whom he had no
right for because he had not sinned christ has gotten right upon us against
the devell and has made us fre and delyvered us and we be made his heirs and
all his glory is ours: as saint Paul does largely declare in all his epistles.
This has God gyven us without our deservyng and we need not to labor for
these things. For we have all this already. As witnessith saint John saying:
John. ^
Behold whate love the father has showed on us that we should be called the
children of God. And in the same chapter. says he. Derely beloved now are we
the children of god. This health has god gyven to us willingly by his son
Jesus Christ. For Jesus Christ is bycome man to satisfy unto his father for us
and to make our peace with his father. To. 3
And as writes Saint Paul unto the Romans / sayi^g we be justified freely by
the grace of God and by the redempcyon which is in Jesus Christ. So is Christ
made a mediator and a peace maker bywene God the father and man. As says
saint Paul unto the Hebrews: he may make them safe for ever that come unto
god by him: Hebre. 7
he is allweyes lyving for to pray for us Such an high pressed it becomes us
to have which is holy / harmles / undefiled separat from sinners and made
higher the^ hevens. And by his death it is granted us that we be christen and
children of God. Gala. 3.
As like wise teaches saint Paul saying Ye are all the children of God by the
faith which is in Jesus christ. And for asmocheas Jesus christ is made man he is
also made our brother. And seeing we be his brethren we be also heirs of his
glory which he has with his father: as says saint Paul unto the Romans.
which has not spared his own son: To. 8.
but has gyve^ him for us all: how shall he not also give unto us all things
with him.

We be then sure that all that is Jesus Christ's is ours if we can beleve it.
Some man might demand. Has god the father willingly gyven us all this? has
none deserved it? No truly: None has deserved it. None by his deserving or
good works has enduced god to do this. But he has done it of him silf / and
by his great mercy: Hiere. 3^
as says the prophet. Jeremy In a perpetuell charity I have loved the And
therefore have I had compassion on the and have taken the to mercy. John. 3.
And Jesus christ says in the gospel of saint John. God has so loved the
world that he has gyven his only begotten son to the intent that whosoever
beleve in him should not perisshe but have everlasti^g life. as writes. S.
Paul. If a law had been gyven which might have justified the justice should
have been truly of the law. Gala. ^
But the scripture has concluded all under sin to the intent that the promise
should be gyven unto the belevers by faith. And unto the Romans. If God be for
us who is he that may be against us? as though he would say: To. 7.
None. for we have receyved all thing of god with his son. But whate thing
have we receyved? this lybertye from the subjection of the devell that is
remission of all sins / that is the joy and glory of the everlastinge life.
And this has god gyven unto us by his son. as saint Paul says unto the
Hebruwes. The blood of Christ which by the holy ghost has offered him silfe
without Hebre. ^
spot unto God has cleansed our consciences from mortal works for to serve
unto the lyving God. And therefore we have no need to labor by our good
works to get everlasting life / for we have that already: we be all justified
we be all the children of God. God has gyven us all this of him silf without
our deserving.

Some man might say. I will also do sumwhate to the intent that I may be so much
the more certain to be saved. All they that say so: and all they that think
that their good works help any thing or proufit for to get the gift of
salvation they blaspheme ageynste God / and rob god of his honor and speak
against the might and goodness of God. Gala. 5
as writes saint Paul. If ye be circumcised Christ shall nothing proufit
you. that is to say: if ye put any trust in the law or in any works Christ
shall not help you. And yet says saint Paul in that same Chaptre. whosoever
will be justified by the law is fallen out of the grace of god. How may the
words be more clear. wherefore al they blaspheme against the dyvine puissaunce
that will any manner wey deserve by their good works. for this cause we must
do our good works alweys by love to the proufit of (...) and not for the
necessite of our h^^th for by Jesus christ be we made sure of the everlasting
life / as it is before said. They that by their works will satisfy unto god
be against God / as though God were not puissaunt enough of him silf without
the help of our works for to pardone us our sins / and as though the
passion of Christ were not virtuous enough without our deservinges for to
help us to come unto heven. Therefore (say I) we must allonly and hoelly trust
in the grace and mercy of god / and not in our works or else christ shall
nothing proufit us.

How that by the only grace of God / and by nothing else we be saved.
Chaptre. vi.
Now might some man sey / I know well that god is mighty enough to save me
without my works / but I ca^ not tell whether he will do it if it be not that I
live therewith al rightuously. paraue^ture my good works shall enduce hi^ to
make me rightuous and to save me or else he would not do it. All they that so
say or think (as I have said) blaspheme against the goodness of god / as
though god were not of him silf merciful and good enough / except he were
first stered unto mercy by our works. To. 4.
Not withsto^ding that saint Paul says that the promise was not made unto
Abraham by the law but by the justice of the faith. And seeing also that of his
proper nature he is nothing else but goodness and mercy / as he has alweyes
taught and showed when he was teaching in the world / for he has never
dispysed nor left none discomforted of any thing that any has required him but
only such as would not beleve.

Wherefore thou must know ones for all that by the only grace of god we be
saved. And god will not that thou put thy good works or thy justice with his
pretending to help him by thy works / for he will do it a lone / and will
have no manner help. For he has no need of the counsel nor of the deed nor of
the works nor of the justice of any other. Ephe. 2
For saint Paul says: By grace are ye saved through faith and that not of
your silves for it is the gift of god and comes not of works lest any man
should bost himsilf. Now were it possible to speak it more pleynly / and unto
the Romans: To. 5.
Being justified by faith we are at peace with god. And saint John says: He
is the reco^ciliacion for our sins. 1. John.
The death of Jesus christ and his justice be virtuous enough for to take awey
all the sins of the world.

Now might one demand whi will god justify us and so save us of him silfe?
God does it to the intent that he make his goodness and mercy unto us more clear
/ and more open. Ephe. 2
As writes saint Paul unto the Ephesians: God that is rich in mercy through
the great love wherwyth he loved us even when we were d^ed by sin has
quykned us with Christ by whose grace ye be saved and with hi^ has raised us
up and with him has made us sit in hevenly things through Christ / for to
show in time to come the exceeding richesse of his grace in kindness toward
us through Jesus Christ. Here see thou by these words the cause why god
will do it alone: for if god should justify us / and should give health because
of our works / he should not do it by his goodness / but our works had
deserved it: and so should we not need to thank God therefore but mo^ght
ascribe it to our selves: and unto our works. But saint Paul and all the
prophets do teach us that we be justified and have gotten health by the only
grace of God and not by our deservynges / for we have none. And as god will
that we do not thank laud or love other then alonely him. Also like wise will
he not that we search elsewhere or of any other health but of him only for god
will be our health and our savioure alone / and he will not that we search else
where comfort but in him and of him / and not in our silfe nor in our good
works. And for this cause thus writes saint Paul unto Titus. But after that
the kindness and love of our savioure appeared unto man / not of the dedys of
righteousness which we have wrought but of his mercy he has saved us by the
fonteyne of the new birth and with the renewing of the holy ghost which he
shed over us abundauntly / through Jesus christ our savioure. Titu^. 3
And therefore whosoever think to have deserved the kingdom of heven by his
rightuous life / he robs god of his goodness. for god has freely justified
us of hi^ silf. and our lord him silf has seid in the gospel of S. Ioh: None
may come unto me except my father that sent me draw hi^. John. 6
And in an other place without me ye ca^ do nothing. John. 15
and god spoke by the prophet Osee: O Israel thy perdicio^ comith of thy silf
/ alonely of me comes thy help. Osee. 14
And saint Paul unto the romans. To. 9.
The enerlasting life is not his that will or that r^neth after it: but it is
in the hondes and will of god to gyve it to whom he will by his mercy.

Therefore err all they that think that god owith to them the everlasting
life / or that they have deserved it / when they have done many good works.
for that thing that god only gyveth to whom he will / that would they take
from him / and pluck it out of his ho^des. and they yield no thanks unto god
as did. S. Paul unto the Colossia^s Col. ^.
sayi^g we gyve thanks unto god the father which has made us mete for to the
partakers of the inheritance of saints in light / which has delyvered us
from the power of derknesse / and has translated us into the kingdom of his
dear son / in whom we have redemption through his blood / that is to sey
forgevenesse of sins. Such people get lest of all and are in many times
reprobate and forsaken of god. Lu. 18
As the Pharisey which rehearsed unto god his good works as though he had not
known them. But if thou will have the kingdom of heven. I counsed the that
thou trust nothing in thy good works / but that thou be exercising thy silf
after thy power in deeds of charity and mercy toward thy christen brother. So
as our lord teaches in the gospel saying: Lu. 17.
when ye have done all that to you is commanded / yet say ye / we be
vnproufitable servauntes. Such humble opinion and feling must a christen ha^
if he will be saved. For (as saint Petre says) God resists alweyes the proud
/ but unto the humble he gyveth grace. 1. Pe. 5.
for god loves much more a sinner which humbles him silf axing mercy / then
one that thinks that he is holy / and that he has done many good works
exalting him silf in them and thinkinge that God owith to him the kingdom of
heven / because of his good works. For (as I have said) God will save none for
his good works / but he will save us all by his mercy: to the intent that we
should thank him for it / and to the intent that to him alone and to his name may
be gyven all glory preyse and grace / and that all the world may praise and
exalte the goodness and mercy of him alone. To. 3
For saint Paul says that the rightuonsnesse that comes of god is declared
without the fulfillinge of the lalawe and for this cause would God suffer none
to come into everlasting life before the coming of Jesus christ nether Abraham
/ Isaac nor David. To. 3
For (as saint paul seyth (they all have sinned and lack the preyse that is
of valor before God. and this he would also to the intent that both they and we
should also know that all they that have obtained or shall opteyne health have
and shall opteyne it / by the death of Jesus christ and not by their
righteousness or works for if any might have bin saved by his works /
Abraham and David had come to heven before the coming of Jesus christ. But God
would it not to the intent that we should know that all our health lies in the
death of Jesus Christ / which by his mercy he has suffered for us There is none
other wey for to come to everlasti^g life but by Jesus Christ crucyfied for us.
And therefore we must put all our trust in God alone / we shall take all our
comfort of God only calling upon his mercy in this manner.

O dear lord god almighty / I poor sinner confess before thy dyvine
p^^ssaunce / that by my sins. I have deserved the everlasting death of hell by
thy great justice. But alweyes I take hope and comfort in thy godly promise
whereby thou saydest in thy gospel: He that beleveth in the son of god shall
have everlasting life. John. 3
for this cause I poor sinner come toward the dear lord Jesus christ which art
the only fontayne of mercy not trusting in my good works (which be but
stinki^g before the) nor in any worldly thing but only in the alone: for thou
alone art the wey the troth and the life. And I pray the that unto me poor
sinnar thou will do thy grace and mercy Amen.

So shall the christian humble him silf and understood of hi^silf and of his
good works. Esaie 64
for (as says Esai) all our justice is as it were the clothe of a woman
suffering the flowers. God has saved none by his works but only by his
divine grace and mercy As teaches saint Paul: Ephe. ^
ye are saved by grace through faith and that not of your silf And if it be by
grace (as says saint Paul ageyn) then is it not by the deservinge of works
for then were grace no grace. To. 1^
Hereby may thou perceive that god will that our health come of his grace and
mercy and not of our deserv^nges. For if any may deserve heven by his works
then is it no grace or gift of god: but it is vet and wages. And then god of
him silf gives it not unto us: but we get it as for vauntes that serve for
wages. And that can be by no means for saint Paul teaches us in many places
that we be justified and have obtained health by the grace of god and not by
our good works but by our feith. for it is a gift of god and not hyres or
wages for labor: Ephe. ^
to thinte^t that we should not esteem that we had saved ouresilves. for. s.
Paul says: when we were deed by sin / he has quickened us with christ.
wherefore we shall not glorify i^ our silves / but i^ god alone. for god will
not that we search hi^ for wages as servauntes. But he will that we shall love
him as children their father and that we serve him by love without desiringe
any thing but to please him. for he him silf has seid to his apostles: John. 15
I call you not now servauntes / but friends. Psalm. 21
And Christ has said by the prophet to his hevenly father I will show thy
name to my brethere^. And ageyn to his apostles: Mat. 23
Call ye no man father on the earth: for ye have one father in he^en. And
therefore has Jesus christ not learned us to pray. Our lord which art in
heven: Mat. 6
but our father / for we be his children / and if we be the children of god we
be his heirs / as says saint Paul. To. 8


To whom the grace of god is given. Chaptre.vij.
ONe might axe: Is this grace of god gyven to every body: Nay / but it is gyven
to all them that beleve. And all they that beleve in Jesus christ in such
manner as we have before declared / and shall all declare more pleynly they be
the children of god / as writes saint John in the gospel saying. John. 1
Unto as many as receyved him gave he power to be the sons of god in that
they beleved in his name. And as says saint Paul. He that comith to god must
beleve that he is God and that he is a rewarder of them that seek him. Hebre.
1^.
Therefore we have seid that all the new testament does teach us principally
none other thing but faith and trust in Jesus christ. and therefore the feith is
the foundation of Christendom. For this cause if thou will that the passion
and grace of christ be to thy socoure and proufit it behooves that thou beleve
him steadfastly without any manner waveringe to thinten: that thou know that it
is all grace / and not deserving and that the words and promyses of god be
verey certain and true. for god has called us his children as saint Paul
says: Because that ye are sons god has sent the sprite of his son into
our hertes crying Abba father Then art thou now no servaunt but a son.
Gala. 4
and if thou be a son then art thou also heir of god by christ / and so be
we delyvered from our sins and from the bondage of the devell: and made
heirs of the kingdom of heven by the benefit of Jesus christ.

He beleveth in god that puts all his trust and hope in god and in the
justice of god / living after his power according to the rule of charity /
having no manner hope nor trust in the world / in his good works or good life /
but alonly in the goodness of god / and in the merits of Jesus christ beleving
certeynly that god will hold to him that he has promised remission of sins
and certeynte of everlasting life. He that does so is a true christen and
beleveth steadfastly that the words of god must needs be true. Notwithstanding
that according to his works he thinks it a thing ympossible. Nevertheless
he beleveth that he shall be saved without deservinge of any good works rather
then the words of god and all things that they do promise should not come to
pass. As writes saint Paul of Abraham which beleved rather that his wife
which was bareyne and out of thage of generacyon should conceyve a child
rather the^ the promise of god should not be fulfilled. And by this faith was
Abraham reputed just before God and not by his good works. So behooves it
that every christen do / albeit that it seem to him ympossible to be saved
because he has done no good / he shall nevertheless stykke steadfastly unto
the goodness and mercy of God and unto his word in such manner that he doubt
not in nothing. Lu. 2^
For Christ says in Saint Luke. Heven and earth shall pass but my word shall
never pass.

Of this says writes Saint Paul unto the Romans. To. 10.
whosoever shall call on the name of the lord God shall be saved. He therefore
that calls upon him on whom he beleveth not that he may help him loses
but his labor. Therefore thou must first beleve in him. And then if thou call
upon him with such a faith as we have spoken of thou shall be saved Of this
faith speaks also the prophet Esaie (as recy^eth Saint Paul the apostle in
the forseyd Chaptre) All they that believe in hymshall not be ashamed. And ageyn
saint Paul. To. 10
If thou confess with thy mouth that Jesus is the lord / and that thou believe
with a perfaict heart that God has reised christ from death thou shall be
saved. And the word that Christ preched first as recyteth Saint Mark was: The
time is full come and the kingdom of god is evyn at hand repent and beleve
the gospel. Mar. 1
Of this faith writes like wise saint John and they be the words of Christ
unto Nicodemus as Moses lift up the serpent in wilderness / even so must the
son of man be lift up that no man that beleveth in him perisshe but have
eternal life. John. 3
God so loved the world that he gave his only son for the intent that none
that beleve in him should perisshe but should have everlasting life. And a little
after he that beleveth in him shall not be condemned / and ageyn in the same
chaptre. He that beleveth on the son has everlasting life / and he that
beleveth not the son / shall not see life but the wrath of god abides upon
him.

By all these escriptures here may thou see that we be all the children of
God / alonly through faith, and this had God lever promise unto us because of
our faith then because of our good works to the intent that we should be so
much the more certain of our health And therefore says saint Paul / by faith
is the enheritaunce gyven that it might come of grace that the To. 4.
promise be sure and steadfast to all the seade, for if god had said whosoever
will do such or such works shall be saved / we should ever have been i^certeyn
whether we should have been saved or not. for we should never have known whether
we had dogood enough to have deserved the life eternal. But now god has
promised it unto us because of our faith / by his favor not by our works /
to the intent that we be the more sure thereof. For let us beleve steadfastly and
we may know for certain that we be the children of god. Not that we have
deserved it: but because he has promised it. And it must needs be that the
word of god be true for this cause if we have perfeit trust in god and beleve
perfeitly in him we shall be sure that we shall be saved. It was such a feith that
saint Paul had when he seid: 2. Ti. ^
I know and am sure that he to whom I have committed and gyven my gage to
keep is mighty enough to keep it for me till that day: And ageyn: I have fought
a good batayl. 2. Ti. 4.
I have fulfilled my course and have kept the faith / from hensforth is leyd up
for me a crown of righteousness which the lord that is a rightuous judge
shall give me at that day: Not unto me only but unto all them which love his
coming. 1. Ioh. 3
And saint John says: Derely beloved now are we the sons of God. And yet
it has not appeared whate we shall be we knew that when he shall appear we shall be
like hi^ for we shall see hi^ as he is

This faith had also saint Martine at the hour of his death when he said unto
the devell: why art thou here thou bloody be? thou have naught in me / the
seed of Abraham shall receyve me.

This suertye had likewise saint Imbrose when one axed him if he feared not the
death? he answered why should I fear? seeing that we have one so good a lord

For this cause must we love the death and more desire to dye and to be with god
(as did saint Paul) then to fear the death. Phi. 1
for Jesus christ is deed for us to the intent that we should not fear to dye.
And he has flayne the death and has destroyed the streynght of death. as
writes saint Paul saying: 1. Cor. 15
O death where is thy victory? It is swalowed and brought to naught by victory.
Phi. 1
And unto the Philippyans. Christ is my life and death is to me advauntage.

How that feith brings Charity and Charity good works Chaptre.viij.
Now might one axe: when I beleve certeynly that I am the child of god and
that Jesus christ has satisfied for me unto his hevenly father / as teaches
saint Paul saying: 1. Ti. 2
which has gyven him silf a price and ransom for all men. Then when I
beleve: need I not to do nothing? Need I not to do no good? shall I not keep
the commandments of God? Harken whate saint Paul answers. The faith
(says he) works by love. Ga. 5
Then when thou thus beleuest without douti^g that is to sey that thou art the
son of god / and that god has so made the great and rich thou shall think
thus in thy ^ilf. Behold now god has made me his child enheritour of his
glory and brother of Jesus christ has give^ me pardon of al my sins and I
shall shortly be with hi^ in the everlasting life which he has gyve^ me
without deserving it (...) thing shall I do agein to god by love and kindness
for all this that he has gyven to me? Psalm. 115
As says the prophet David: whate shall I yield to god ageyn for all that he
has gyven to me: when any parson speaks thus in him silf considering and
beholding the great goodness and mercy of god / then comith and entreaseth
the love of god in him by the faith / because that he beleveth surely that God
has thus made him great and rich. And after that the love is thus entered and
enchauffed in the heart of the parson it makes him to suffer and bear all
things and makes him to labor to think and to do all that he thinks would
please god / without regarding any thing but the love of god. Cor. 13.
as says saint Paul: Love suffers all things / love does nothing in vain.
and he that has such a love toward god: all that he does is agreeable to god:
Ye when he gyveth but a drop of water for goddis sake as writes saint Mathewe.
for love i^ god can not sin all that he does is well done For the holy ghost
that has put this charity in us can not do evil. And if of adventure by such
a good intent one did any evell by error this evell shul be pardoned
incontinent and reputed for good by the good intent and love that he has
toward god. Mat. 6.
For Christ says in the gospel. If thine yie (that is to sey thine
entencion) be simple and applying to good / all thy body that is to sey (all
thine operacion) shall be lightened and good. And saint Paul says: To. 8
we know that unto them that love god al things work for the best. All they
that are constant in this faith and charity be the children of god and please
god. As witnessith saint Petre where he speaks in thactes of thappostles. Of
a truth I perceyve that god is not percyall / but in all people he that fears
him and works righteousness is accepted with him, for god needs not our
works when he thus has our hertes albeit that such a love can not be ydell.

This love comith in us (as I have seid) by faith / when the parson beleveth
surely that he is the child of God. It needs not that such a parsone be
constreyned to do good works by any commandments. For the love of god
dwelling in him can not be ydell. For love (as says saint Paul suffers long
and is courteys 1. Cor. 13.
love e^vyeth not / love is not craving / swells not / deals not
dishonestly / seeks not her own / is not provoked to anger / thinks not
evell / reioyseth not in i^iquite: but reioyseth in the truth / suffers al
thing beleveth all things / hops all things / Such a love or charity
brings a parson to good works / and not good works a parsone unto such a
love / or to such a faith and trust in god. These works spring out of feith
and not feith out of these works. for as I have seid feith brings love and
love brings good works.

Like as though there were a rich man with out children or heirs which might
take a poor beggar out of the street and make him his heir of his goods.
This poor man being this made great and rich if he would be thankful (as
becomith him to be) should serve his lord or master (which had thus exalted
him and made him rich) truly and with great love Ye and if he ones might
know the will of his master / he would not defer the doing thereof till he were
commanded: But he would do all things by and by of his own courage for the
charity or love that he has toward his master without commandment.

Behold this poor man so exalted has not deserved by his works nor by his
service that this rich man should so make him his heir / but the rich man
has made him his heir of his own goodness without that the poor man had in
any manner wise deserved it. And the service that this poor man does afterward
comith of love and kyndnesse. For he knows and beleveth surely that he is
heir of the gods of his lord before that he do any service. And for because
that he beleveth that the rich man will keep promise with him / he begins
to love him by the mean of this faith. And so when he loves him / he does to
him willingly and with good heart / all the service he can / and fulfill ^^leth
joyfully his commandments and all by love. And the more labor and service
that he can do for his good master the more great pleasure he takes.

So is it of a good Christian, for when he was yet enemy of god by the sin of
Adam / he was accepted of God before he ^esyred it: and before that he had in
any manner wise deserved it. Thus has god made us his children and heirs
without our deserving. Then when we beleve this steadfastly this faith brings
love into our hertes: so that we begin to love God by cause that he has
made us so great and excellent. And when we so love him we keep his
commandments by love and do all things with good will As says Christ in
saint John: John. 14.
He that loves me keeps my commandments. And so keep we all things and
suffer all things which we think agreeable to god and nothing is to hevy for
us, and as says saint Paul: To. 5
we rejoice in tribulacio^ for we know that tribulacion brings patience /
patience brings feling / feling bri^geth hope and hope makes us not a shamed
/ because the love that God has unto us is shed abroad in our hertes / by the
holy ghost which is gyven unto us / which love makes all things light unto
us plesaunt / and easy to bear: so that after the word of Christ in the gospel
his yoke is easy and his burden is light. Mat. 11. Act. 5


This faith and love had thappostles (as writes saint Luke) when they departed
from before the judges they reioysed that they were made worthy and able to
suffer shame and dishonor before the world for the love of Jesus christ. This
char^te had saint Paul when he seid unto the Romans. To. 8.
Who is he that shall separate us from the love of god? shall tribulacion or
anguisshe / or persecucion / or hunger / or nakydnesse^ other parell orswerd?
we be sure that neither death nor life nether angel nether rule nor things
present nor things to come / nether height nor depnesse nether any other
creature shall be abyll to separat us from goddis love which is in Jesus christ
our lord.

But I axe you now whereby is it that thou know that thou are the child of
god? by the service that thou have done hi? Nay. Whereby then? by the faith where
by thou belevest the word of god which says that thou art the child of god
before thou begynnest to serve him / as writes saint Paul in all his
epistles. Thy service and thy works have not gyve^ the the faith and trust
whereby thou belevest that thou art the child of god and his heir / for thou
had that or thou dydest hi^ any service. but because that thou belevest
steadfastly that god has made the so great by this faith beginnest thou to love
him. And when thou love him so / thou do him all the service that thou
know is agreeable unto hi^. Thou ^beyst his commandments / alweyes humbly
knoweleging thine ymperfection / ascribing all that thou do unto God. for
else as says saint Paul. To. 4
If our heretage came of the law / the feith were but in vain and the
promise of none effect.

Behold now see thou that we do not deserve the everlasting life by our
good works / for God has promised it unto us all surely before that we began
to do good. wherefore thou must know and beleve that good works make none sure
that he shall be the child of God and his heir. But contrary wise the feith and
trust that thou have in god (whereby thou belevest steadfastly that he ha^h made
the his son) makes the to serve god and to keep his commandments by love*
wherefore all they are abused (Theologyans and doctors: that sey that certeynte
or hope proceeds out from good works* For contraryly / out from the certeynte
and from the feith (whereby thou belevest the goodness that god has done unto
the) comith the good works. That is to sey when thou belevest / thou begynnest
to love and when thou love / thou do that God would have done.

How that we shall not serve God for hyres or wages. Chaptre. ix.
THe works done in such faith and charity be allonely plesau^t unto god and
worthy to be called good works. for they be the works of the holy ghost that
dwells in us by this faith. But they that are done by tediousness and evil
will / for fere of hell or for desire of paradise be none other thing but
shadows of works maki^g ypochrytes. The end of our good works may se^ke
naught but to please god knowlegi^g that if we do never so much we ca^ never
do our duty. for they that for fear of hell or for the joys of heve^ do
serve god do a co^streined service which god will not. Such people do not
serve God because he is their god and their father: but because he is rich
and for to have part of his richesse, they not god but his ways and richesse:
that is to sey they serve for none other purpose but to have their rewards
and for to avoid his punissions. And such people be as it were hired men and
waged servauntes and are not children for the service they do is but for wages
and hyres. But the children of god serve their father for love for they know
the goodness that god has done to them already in that they believe that god
has made them his children and heirs. Gala. 3
For saint Paul seith ye are all the children of god by the feith which is in
Jesus Christ: And ageyn: forasmoche as ye be children god has sent the sprit of
his son in to your hearts crying: Ga. 4
father father. Thou art then now no servaunt but a son. And if thou be the
son thou art also heir of god by christ as says saint Paul. ye are all
the children of ^ight and children of god. Tessa. 5
Then the children of god (that is the true christen do not desire to get the
heretage by their service for they know by the sure promyses of god (which
they do beleve) that God of him self has purely and liberally given it unto
them already. Is when a burgoys has a servaunt and a son. The servaunt
serves his master and dare not offend him for fear of losing of his wages
which he attends for: for he serves for wages / and after that he has
receyved them he levith his master and axeth no more of him for he demanded
nothing else but his money which he has receyved already. The son of the house
serves his father and keeps his commandments not to have wages but for
love that he has unto his father. For he knows the goodness that his father
has done to him and that he is heir of the goods of his father. And knows
that he shall ever dwell in his fathers house / as says saint John. John
And therefore does he liberally the will of his father by cause he will not
anger him. So must every christen serve god and keep his commandments by
true love and not by hope to get for his service everlasting life or the
heritage of his heve^ly father but knowleging alonly that god has gyven him
that already / and that he has made him his heir ^yfore he required him. So
shall he serve him by love declaring that god is all good, and to show that
against his goodness he will not be unkind.

How that we disheret oursilves by our disobedience. Chaptre. x.
Now must every man know that alonly they that by such love serve God be the
children of god his heirs and shall be saved. For he that gyveth not thanks to
God and loves him not of this facyon for the goodness that god of him silf
has willingly done unto him is cause that he is not the child of god and
makes him silf unworthy of all the promyses of God.

Like as though there were a man that had gotten some great richesse by his
labor and that he had.ij. sons / The. ij. sons be here egally like nighe
unto the goods of their father and the heritage of their father belongs
egal^i^ unto the^ / for they be both sons. But if the one be rebel and
disobedient unto his father and do to him dishonor after that he come to thage
of discretion by such means may h^ be cause of dishereting of him silf ^ he
is naturelly son^nd heir to the goods as well as his other brother / but he
disheriteth him silf by his evil life.

So are all parsones the children of god / and bought ageyn by Jesus Christ but
they that rebel against god / and obey not unto his commandments disheryt
them silves and them silves because of their da^pnacyon. God would willingly
have saved them / for he did promise to them (among other) the heritage of
his kingdom and had made them his children / but they dampne them silves.
They are the children of God / as concerning goddis behalf / but they are
alweyes dampened because of their disobedience.

Ye some time god calls such people his fre^des / not that they be so / but
because they might have bin so. Mat. 2
As he said unto Judas / My fre^d why art thou come hither? Mat. 2
And unto hi^ that came unto the wedi^ges / my friend how art thou entered here
not having the weddi^g garment. Behold he is called friend and yet
nevertheless he suffers hi^ to be cast into darkness. he had bi^ the fre^d
of god if he would have consented to the will of god. 1 John
Saint John says. There is now mani an^christes / they went out from us were
not of us / for if they had been of us they had bydden with us. So be all people
the children of god / but there be many that make them silves unworthy and
depart them silves from god.

The other son that abides with his father is a son / and abides a son
and heir because he is obeisaunt unto his father. He has not deserved by his
good life and obedience the possessyon and goods of his father / but he has
only been well ware that he has not lost them by disobedience: For the father
may sey. Dear son it is true that thou have kept to the best of thy power my
commandments / notwithst^nding thy goodness had never made the rich if I
had not gotten it. Then like wise all though that we keep the commandments
of god never so streytly it should profit us nothing if it were not that Jesus
christ had obtained for us the life eternal before of his hevynly father by
his death. Our goodness or justice should profit us nothing if Jesus christ
had not labored for us. For (as says saint Paul) The law has brought
nothing unto perfection. Hebr. 7
The Iues kept the commandments and the law of god yet they co^de not come
unto heven. It was nedeful that Jesus Christ must first dye for them Likewise
can we not be saved by our works. Our health is come to us of god For if by
our works we may got health ^hen must we needs say that Christ is deed in
vain. As says saint Paul. Ye if works might have saved? Abraham / Isaac /
Jacob / David and many other Iu^s had been saved (as we have said) before the
natiuyte of Jesus Christ / for they kept better the commandments of god then
we do. But god will do it alone to the intent that none glorify or bost him silf
thereof and that to him alone and to none other he gyven all honor and glory
for ever Amen.

For (as writes saint Paul) The scripture concludes al things under sin
that the promys by the feyth of Jesus Christ should be gyven unto them that
beleve. Ga. 3
For this cause when the parsone knows surely that god has made him child
of the everlasting life / by his death before he had deserved it / he will do
again to god all the service that he can think / and all by love and
kindness showing that he will not be unkind / not to get any thing of godbut
because he is his good father / and that he has receyved al things of him.
For we have now already all that wherefore we must serve god. For he has made us
his children / and his heirs / while we were his enimyes / and before that we
knew him as we have many times before said. And hereyn lies the deserving of
the christen faith / that thou beleve certeynly that thou art the child of god
and that thou kepest his commandments because thou know and belevest
steadfastly that he has so made the rich and great / and that thou servest
him by this faith as a good child his father / For the child dou^teth not /
but beleveth steadfastly that he shall have the substance of his father / and
because he beleveth it steadfastly he labors for to entreteyne it. So shall
thou beleve without doubting any thing that thou art enheryter of heven. And
therefore shall thou do thy diligence to keep that heritage to the honor of thy
father.

Thou shall be ware that thou anger him not but thou shall thank him often
because he has gyven the this hevenly heritage.

Behold now seist thou well before thine yien how much we are bound to
thank / praise and serve god. and to keep his commandments / and to keep us
from sin and to do many good works of faith by verey love.

Of two manner people lyving in this world. Chaptre. xi
THere are i^the world. ij. sorts of people / good and evil / and be compared
unto the two theves that suffered on the cross with Jesus christ* the good are
berokened by the thief on the right side / which axed pardon: and they be they
that knowledge the^ silves pore sinners / and feel mekely of them silves: Lu. 18
as did the poor publican that durst not lift up his yies toward heven / for
they know that they have not kept the commau^deme^tes of god so streytly as
they were bound. They perceive also that though they think to keep the^ never
so well they feel them silves failing alweyes in detraction ^n hastiness in
anger / in idell words in infidelite and in lakke of love / albeit that such
folk do much goodyet their conscience is not content and in rest but as
concerning them silves ever in sorrow. For they know that they must appear
before the rightuous judge / before whose face (as says the Psalmist) shall
none lyving be justified / if we should be judged after our deservinges. Psalm.
142
And therefore come they and cast them silves prostrate before the mercy of god
and sey with the thief on the right side. Lu. 23
Lord have mind on me when thou come into thy ki^gdome. Thou have
comma^unded me many things and I perceive in my silf that I am frail and
cannot entierly keep thy commandments though I look never so well thereto.
Nevertheless I know that thou nedest not my good works. Seeing it is so that
thou have so much loved me that thou would suffer death for me / when I did
not yet know the / and was yet thine enemy I have trust unto the my most
merciful god that thou will not suffer him to periss he for whom thou have
shed thy blood. For I know that thou art a lord almightye that may all
things in heven and in earth. And I knowledge and worship the / and am certain
that thou will not dampne me. Albeit that I have not deserved heven by my good
works. I know and beleve that thou have satisfied for me when thou dydest
suffer death on the cross. Thou have bought me again with thy precious blood /
and I am thine / the devell has no right in me. Nevertheless if thou wylt
dampne me o merciful god thou may well do it and ryghtuously / for I am
thine / and thou may do with me all that thou will. I am thy creature. Thy
will be fulfilled in earth as in heven. Mat. 6
Yet alweyes to the intent that thy dolorouse passion be not lost in me I pray
the o my most merciful lord Jesus christ / that thou will receyve me into grace
/ as thou have done the good these I know that I am not worthy / and that I
have not deserved yt. But to the intent that thy great mercy may be alweyes the
more manifest / unto the augmentacyon of thy glory / I require the o God most
pnissaunt that thou will not put me a bak out of thy syghte. For thy only
passion is mighty enough for to save me / wythwithout my good works. For if I
^ought deserve the life everlasting by my good works it should seem that thou
had suffered thy passion in vain and that thou had dyed on the cross
in vain. Seeing therefore that thou art surely deed for me and for all the
world / not for thy silf: why should I then be lost o gracyous Jesus christ?
Save thou me / for thou art all good / and may save me / for thou may all
things. Wherefore I know no remedy but to come to thy great mercy. and I
prostrate at thy fete require of the pardon of all my sins. All they that of
an entier heart do thus trust in God / and trust steadfastly that god will save
them / it shall come unto them according to their feyth. And this is the
most certeynte and the most sure wey for to come to heven and unto the life
eternal / that every one forsake him silf and put all in the hond of god /
alweyes doing his best to keep the commandments of God / and to lyve
according to the teaching of the gospel / and altogyther distrusting of him
silf.

The other that be signified by the thief on the lift hand are they that put
all their trust in their good works. They goo daily to the church: they
keep and halowe all the festfull days: they fast often they here mass daily:
And when they must dye they trust in their good works / and think that god
owes to them the kingdom of heven and that they them silves have deserved
it. These manner of people be sonest dampened for they knowledge not that god has
satisfied for them / but make to them gods of the works of their hondes
counting thereby that they have deserved heven, for that thing is every man's
god wherein he puts his trust. This is one of the grettest errors that is in
christendom. for if a man might save him silf by his good works Christ were
deed in vain: As says saint Paul. Saint John baptist / Abraham / Isaac / and
Jacob / with many other patriarchs have lyved much more holily then ever we
shall lyve. Ga. 2
Yet could they never by their good works come to heve^. It was needful that
christ should first come to suffer death for them that his passion should sa^e
them / not their works / but the feith and trust that they had in ^ Goddis
promyses / whereby they beleved that Jesus Christ should come / and should deliver
them?

But I do not sey these words that the good works done in feyth should be
evil. No: I do counsel all the world to do many good works / principally the
works of love and mercy toward their neighbors / in socouring them in all
their necessites only for the love and honor of god / without seching any
other thing and that he should so labor freely and with a joyous heart to obey
unto the commandments of God and counsel of the gospel / doing the works
comprysed in the holy scripture / and not them which the covitousnesse of the
Pharysees have devysed.

But to do these works and to think to deserve everlasting life and so to put
his trust in them / is to lyve as do now at this-day the Iues and verey
Idolatres. For God will have the hole heart and will not that it be fixed on any
other thingbut in him alone. Ye he wills that all that we do in this life /
shall be none other thing but a token of kindness and giving of thanks of that
we have receyved of him. for if we have steadfast faith and trust in him alone /
we have now receyved and be sure of that that such tedious and weary workers
would get / as we have seid before and will sey more pleynly. And all such
scripulous doers of good works and therein seking their health and-trusting in
them that think they shall be saved when they have slain noman / and when they
have drawn noman to sin / and theruppon putting their trust / be like unto
the pharisey of whom Christ speaks in the gospel which rehearsed his works
for to have praise and reproved the poor humble publican knowleging his fault
and axing pardon. Lu. 18


It were better for the a thousand fold that thou / had been a sinner and
never done good deed / and that thou knowledge thine offenses and evil life
unto god axing mercy with good heart lamenting thy sins: then to have done
such good works and in them to put thy trust thinkinge that therefore God
were bound unto the. There is nothing which (after the manner of speaking)
byndeth God but ferme and steadfast feith and trust in him and his promyses. for
god requires not principally our good works / for he needs them not: but
he desires our hearts and all our intencion to seek in all things no thing
but his honor: And that we trust not in our works / but (forsaking our
silves) all hoelly in him and not in our deservinges. For we can show unto
god no gretter honor then feith and trust in him / for whosoever does that /
he confesses that god is true / good / mighty / and merciful. And when we
sin it is not the worse unto god. we mynisshe not his glory by our sins
for his glory ca^ nether be augmented nor mynisshed forasmoche as it is
infinite. And for because that we can do no manner hurt or annoysaunce unto God
by our sins therefore is he lightly appaised this stonding that with an
entier heart without any fayning we knowledge our defaute and demand humbly
pardon. And likewise when we do any good we do not increase his glory by our
works for god abides alweyes one. All the danger that there is in our sin
is the evyll example that we gyve to our neighbor in that we hurt him thereby
dispising the good council of our good god which he has give^ us in his
holy commandments / for because we be unkind against the great grace that he
has done unto us / which is a thing horrible and worthy of eternal
punissheme^t because that it is infinite and eternal (the holy commandment)
against which we have offended. But because his proper nature is good and
merciful he pardons all these that confess him to be such. Therefore loves
god better a sinnar repenting and axing pardone of his sins then he does a
worker of good works proudely bosting him silf and tru^ling in them. For (as
it is said) God has loved better the publica^ then the pharesey and has
showed more love unto the poor open sinners then to the phareseys and
ypochristes to whom it seemed that they had fulfilled the commandments of
god / and that god could nothing demand of them.

For they reproved Jesus christ that he was friend of the sinners and that he
ete among them. Mat. 9.
Our lord demau^deth nothing but the heart and when he has the heart / he
regards not whether we fast / pray / or here mass / or whether we bear blewe
or gray. For all such outward things be indifferent before god. When our
hearts be ruled in God according to the doctrine of the gospel / it is all one
whate thing we do / for we have alweyes love / which teaches us whate thing
we must do / or leve undone / for love does nothing in vain.

For this cause an humble heart not abiding upon his good works though he do
them: but putting all his hope and trust in god and founding him silf upon
his goodness / grace / and mercy / belevyng steadfastly that god has all
satisfied for us and that of him silf he has justified us and given us health /
does purely and liberally without demanding any wages all the service and all
the good he can alweyes knowleging him silfe to be dettour unto god and axing
grace. Such an heart is only plesaunt unto god.

Some might now sey. I beleve well all this that I am the child of God / and I
must serve god by love and kindness / in knowleging only by my service the
godnesse that he has done unto me but whate shall I do for the better / how
shall I show unto god my kyndnesse and love? Albeit that we have often touched
this matter before / yet we will declare in the Chaptre following more pleynly
the things that shall be needful to this purpose.

Of good works and by whate mean they be most pleasing to God. Chaptre.xij.
FOrasmoche as I have much spoken of the feith and trust in god to the intent
that the evil and perverse (which interpret and take all things to the
worse and corrupt them) shall not sey that I do learn and counceyle you to do
no good works I will now show you whate things ye shall do.

I have many times said that faith brings Charity / and charity good works.
For if thy feith induce the not to do good works: then have thou not the right
faith. Thou do but only think that thou have it. For saint James says
that faith without works is deed in it silf. Ia. 2
He feith not that it is little or feeble but that it is deed. And that that is
deed is not. Therore when thou art not moved by feith unto the love of god /
and by the love of god unto good works / thou have not the feyth / but the
feith is deed in the. for the sprite of god that by feyth comith into our
hertes to styre up love can not be ydell. Every one does as much as he
beleveth / and loves as much as he hops. John. 3
As writes Saint John / he that has this hope that he is the son of god
purifyeth him silf as he is pure. He seith not he that purifyeth him silf has
this hope. for the hope must come before / proceeding from the feith as it
behooves that the tree must first be good which must bring forth good fruit.
The^ it behooves to know first that ye are the children of God and afterward to
labor.

But whate shall we do? we shall do and lyve so with our christen brethren /
as Christ has lived and done with us that is to sey as Jesus christ has offered
him silf to us and for us so must we present and give our silves as it were a
Christ for to serve them / and to socoure unto their need. Phi. 2.
As says Saint Paul: Let the same mind be in you the which was in Christ
Jesus / which being in the shape of god and thought it no robberi to be equal
with god Nevertheless he made him silf of no reputacio^ and took on him the
shape of a servau^t and all for our proufit. And so must we help serve and
comfort one an other as Jesus christ has done with us. we may not seek our
own proufit avau^tage or honor but al things profitable unto our neighbor
alweyes mi^dfull to procure the honor of god and that in all things we help
our christian brother, for so warns us. S. paul that none seek his own
profit / but his neighbors and that all that we do be unto the honor of
God. we must set before us the life of Jesus Christ as a rule of all thing that
is expedient for us to do / or to leve undone. we must take pain to follow him
in meekness / in love / in swetnesse / and in compassyon. And to lyve so with
our neighbor as Jesus christ has lyved with us.

For Jesus Christ was not borne for him silf / nor has not lived here for hi^
silf / but for us. He sought not his own honor but his heve^ly fathers
Likewise shall thou not seek that is proufitable unto the but ^ovenable unto
thy neighbor. As teaches us saint Paul in all his epistles and namely in the
first unto the Cori^thie^s I seek ^or. 10
not (says he) that that is necessary and proufitable unto me but that that
is proufitable to many to the intent that they should be saved. Ephe. 4
And unto the Ephesians. He that robbed let him rob no more but labor
rather with his hondes and that is good / to the intent that he have whereof to
gyve to him that has need. Ga. 6
And unto the Gaiathiens. Bear (says he) either of you others charges and
burdons and so shall yon fulfill the law of god.

And for because that we speak now of good works. It must be known that we
must do some works for our silves and some for our christen brethren / but
all for the love and honor of god. Them that we shall do for our silves
teaches us Eol. 3
saint Paul seying that we must mortyfie in us all evil desires / and all
carnal operacyons as uncleanness covityze / wrath / blasphemye / detraction
pride and other like vices. To. 6
And unto the Romans. That sin reygne not in your mortal b^dy / that is to
sey / albeit that we ca^ not lyve without the mocyon of such evil desires we
shall not suffer the^ to rule in us but shall mortyfie them in resisting them.

Whate we should do for our Christen brethren teaches us like wise saint
Paul sayng. Serve ye one an other by love and bear ye one an others burden.
For christ commands us to exercise the works of mercy whereof he shall hold
his judgment. All other works that men do at this day in the churches be
rather found by avarice then commanded of god / except the prayers which may
in no wise be done to get money / but alonely by love in praying one for an
other.

Behold now see thou well how great occasyon thou have to do good. For thou
have alweyes occasion to mortyfie thine evil desires to serve thine neighbor
/ to comfort him / to help him / with work / with word / with counceyl /
with exhortacyon / and by other semblable means / In such love toward our
neighbor for the love of God lies all the law and the prophets (as says
Christ). Ye and all the verey Christente / and not in fasting / keeping of
halydayes / watching praying and synging long prayers / daily and all day
hering of masses / setting up of candels / runnyng on pilgremages / and other
such things / which as well the ypochrites / proud people / envious / and
subjects to all wikked affections do: Ye and many times enforce them silf
more there unto then the good christen. But so to serve and socoure the one the
other by verey love can none do but they that have true faith and the verey
love of god. And whosoever so loves his christen brother he is alweyes joyful
in his conscience. For he knows surely that he is the child of god and that
God is his good father / and is well content in his courage of all that god
sends unto him. But he that has not this love is alweyes sorry / full of
anguisshe and woteth not whate to do to deserve more / he fasteth / he keeps
halydayes / now of one saint / now of an other. He seyth his prayers now
before one altre / now before an other. He renneth on pilgremage now here
now there and can never come unto the rest and quiet of his conscience. For
such works make no man sure / but make rather ypochrites trustyng in their
works.

But the verey faithful cleveth to god / for he knows that he may never
satisfy nor do enough to deserve the everlasting life. And therefore he puts
his trust in god and beleveth steadfastly that he has satisfied for us / and
that he has justified us. And therefore it is all one to hi^ whate thing he do
so that he please him and exercise charity to his neighbor for the love of god
for he knows that God demands nothing but the heart and that he regards
not how we do the work so that yt be according to the teachi^g of the
gospel which commands but charity. And so comith he by feyth and trust in
God unto rest and quiet of heart and conscience and is well content to dye when
it pleases god

Of.iiij. manner of feythes after the holy scripture and which is the Christen
feyth. Chaptre.xiij.
THis present Chapitre (because I have much spoken of faith / and that
scarcely of a thousand one knows not this feith) teaches of how many manner
feithes there is made me^cio^ in the holy scripture / not as do now the
doctors which have found many manner of feythes. I will only speak of iiij.
manner of feithes which are most comunely found in the holy scripture. The
first faith is this which the merchants hold one to an other and feithfull
friends / whereby they keep promise and fidelite the one to the other: Eccle. 2^
and. 27
whereof speaks the wise saying: possess or keep feith with thy friend / in
his povertye: to the intent that in his wealth thou may be joyful. And ageyn he
that discloseth the secret of his friend / loses his faith. And in the
Proverbes: He that gyveth his faith for a stranger shall be vexed with evell.
And this is the faith whereof the worldly people complain seying there is no
feith in the world.

The second feith is when we beleve that a thing is to come / and such
things as we here or read: as we beleve that Rome is a City in Italye / or
that Cartage was destroyed of the Romans / and this we beleve although we have
not seen yt. Also we beleve that Jesus Christ has he relyved on earth and that
he has preached and that he is d^ed for us / and that he has done many other
things. when we beleve these things after the story we beleve that this is
our christen faith / The simple people aloneli does not beleve this but also
many doctors in Theologye which are taken for wise. Ye the devell has also
this faith / as says saint James: The devels beleve and tremble. Ia. 2.
for (as we have said before) the devell beleveth that god is god / and that
Jesus Christ has here preached / that he was deed / buried and risen. This
must we also beleve / but yet this is not the faith whereof speaks the gospel
and saint Paul.

The third faith is that we beleve that god may all things / and that he is
rightuous / good and holy. This faith have also the devels and Judas had it
also / and other disciples that did miracles in the name of Jesus but they were
therefore never the better. for when they bosted them silves and were joyful
that by their faith they expulsed the devils in the name of Jesus. Lu. 10
Jesus Christ has reproved them saying: Joy not you that the spretes be under
your power / but rejoice because your names be written in heven. 1. Cor. 1^
Of this faith writes saint Paul unto the Corinthians saying: If that I had
all feith so that I could move mountaignes out of their places / and yet had
no love I were nothing.

The.iiij. faith is our Christen faith / whereof so much speak Jesus christ /
saint Paul and saint John / and sey that it is the foundation of christendom.
And this is the feith whereof I speak in this book None has this faith but
they that put all their trust / hope comfort / refuge and finally all their
health in god alone serching all these things in him and loking for the^ of him
/ and not of their deservinges or good works. Of this feith speaks saint
Paul saying: whosoever call on the name of god shall be saved. To. 10
And the prophet Ieremye / Blessed is that man that trusts in the lord god.
Iere. 17
And Christ in the Gospel To thinient that none that beleve in him should
periss he but should have everlasting life. John. 3
And in the book called Paralipomeno^ Beleve in your lord God and you shall be
assured and without thought. Pa. 20
Beleve his Prophets and all happy things shall come unto you. And almost all
the Psalms all the prophets and all the leves of the holy Bible teach us
that we must beleve and hope in God by a sted fast faith. whereof speaks so
much Saint Paul the apostle / and which he prayseth so much in all his
epistles. And (as we have abundauntly said in the Chaptres before) none may
comprehend this faith / but he that considers whate was the faith of Abraham:
As writes saint Paul unto the Galathyans saying: Abraham beleved God and yt
is rekened to him for ryghtuousnesse. Ga. ^
For by his faith has he obtained that he is called our father and we be
called his children in the holy scripture / that is to sey / we be the
childern of the faith. For by the mean of our faith we be saved / as Abraham
was justified by his faith and has gotten by his faith that all they that
shall have such faith may like wise be iustyfyed. For this cause whosoever
has not the faith of Abraham / nothing can come unto him of that which
Abraham beleved. That is to say / when God is not thy hope and thy comfort /
when thou abydest not with a steadfast trust upon God when thou art not ready to
suffer and endure all things / namely also the death for the love and honor of
god: And also to lose all that thou have in the world thou art not the child
of Abraham. For Abraham was ready to all things whereunto god would send him.
Such was Job when he said: Job. 13
Albeit that he kill me I will put my trust in him And the wise says. Pro. 12
Whatsoever thing come to the rightuous let him not sorrow. And saint Pa^le
says who shall separat us from the love of Jesus Christ? To.8.
shall tribulacion persecucion ^werd or death? And as saint Petre says: 1.
Pet. 3.
who is he that may hurt you if ye be haunters and folowers of goodness. For
all that ever comyth unto the when thou have this feith be it of man or of the
devell all comyth to thy proufit. As says saint Paul unto the Romans To
them that love God all things be helping and avauncement to good. To. 8.


And therefore pray we alweyes that the will of god be done. For as he is not
here come (as he said him silf) to do his will / Mat. 6.
but the will of his hevenly father / So shall John. 5
not the good Christen desire that his own will be done / but the will of God.
And therefore shall thou bear al things patiently as did Abraham with a
steadfast feyth knowing surely that god will not forsake the for god is thy
father and thou art his child. And it behooves that he do with the what him
pleases. For seeing that he is all good he will nothing but thine health.

None can have such a feyth if he have not therewith the love of god. And he
that has the love of god / has fulfilled the law for all the scriptures
teach us none other thing but that we love god with all our hearts and our
neighbor as our silf / as it is written in saint Mathewe. Mat. 22.
None is a true christen but he that has this love. All other be rather
ypochrites then Christen. For all good works which be not done by charity /
and of good will are all sin before God as says saint Austyn: He that does
good against his will / he does evil albeit that that that he does be good.
For all that I do against my will I hate it. And when I hate the commandment
I hate also him that has commanded it. And as long as the parsone is such he
may not be rightuous* for none may be rightuous but he that keeps and
fulfilleth the commandments of God by charity / and with a joyful heart. And
this is a singular grace of god. And therefore may none be proud of it / for he
ca^ not have it of him silf. So has a man nothing of him silf wherewith he may
exalt him silf For without God can we do nothing. John. 15
As Christ him silf says / wit out me ca^ ye do nothing / No not ones have of
your silf one good thought as says saint Paul. 1. Cor. 4
whate have thou that thou have nor receyved wherefore there is no wey more sure
to come to everlasting life then to humble him silf before God / and to pray
him humbly of mercy nothing trusting in his good works / but with a ferme
trust forsaking him silf to knowledge alweyes to god his imperfection. For we
can come to nothing by our good works if we put any trust in them. For they
are nothing eis but sin / and stinking before God / when God helps us not
by his grace. Esai. 64
As says the prophet Esaie. We are all made unclean and all our justice is
as yt were a clothe of a woman that suffers the flux of blood.

And therefore I can never merveyle enough that many of the religyous parsones
would make other parttakers of thyre good works / by bretheryeldes and
fraternytees / seeing that Christ says in the Gospel: After that ye have done
all that to you is commanded / say ye / we be vnproufitable servauntes / we
have done but our duetye. For none can do to much. None does more then he is
bound to do / but only Jesus Christ which 1. Pet. 2.
only (as says Saint Petre the apostle in his.ij. epistle) Never did sin
nether was there deceyte found in his mouth) has done that he was not bound to
do (And as says the Prophet Esaye) has taken upon hum all our languores.
Csa. 53
And all our sorrows did he bear / he was wounded for our inyquytees / he
was beten for our offenses / and by his strype spots were we made hole.

His justice was only parfait justice for he has done that he was not bound
to do. But we of our silves when we do our best yet can not our justice be
parfeyt when after our advice we do more then we are bound to do yet be we
unrighteous and if we will be rightuous so must gods righteousness make us
rightuous. for as says saint Pa^le / Christ of god to us is made wisdom
justice sanctificacyon and redemption to the intent that (as it is written) He
that rei^yseth should rejoice in the lord. 1. Cor. 1
Saint Paul also teaches us in all his epistles that Jesus Christ is our
justice and that by him we shall be saved and by none other.

Now see thou well / that none can do to much. For of him silf none can do
enough: and that we must take our comfort of the satisfaction of Jesus Christ.
Then why will some sell unto us their merytes and good works and make us
parttakers of them: And if it be not that such ypochristes forsake their
trusting upon there good works and that they learn for to trust upon the
justice and satisfaction of Christ they them sylves shall never be saved. For
the Pharesey had done many good works but because that he stood well in his
own conceyte gloryfyed and bosted him sylf thereof / therefore he was forsaken
of God.

In whate thing lies the Christendom. Chaptre.xiiij.
TKen lies the verey Christianyte in this thing / that thou do all thing that
Charity proceeding from thy faith judges to be agreeable unto god. And when thou
have all done with the lest evil that thou can / that thou judge thy silfe
yet an vnproufitable servaunt / and that by all thy good works thou have yet
deserved nothing / or if there be any thing well done that it apartayneth to
god albeit that by his goodness he will reward it and that he so reward the
goodness that he has done himsilf by his holy sprite being in us. And
therefore have we nothing but that that comyth of god upon whom we must abide
(for I have often said) Christ is our justice that is to sey Christ has
satisfied for us / not to the intent that we should not satisfye but because we
can not satisfye. And when one understands this he sees well how he should
humble him silf before God / and in whom he shall seek his health. And when we
thus distrust in ur silves of our good works we shall forsake our silf and
stikke all holly to god with a steadfast faith and parfait trust. And so doing
we make force unto the kingdom of heven.

And this is it that God requires of us and then he holds to us his promise
and he justifies us when we dye with such a trust not for our works / but
for his holy name: For he has promised us that we shall be his children. So
brought he the children of Israel into the land of promission / not by their
merit (for they were many time rebels / and murmured against him) but to
fulfill his promise. For he had promised it to Abraham / Isaac and Jacob.

So shall not the Christen distrust albeit he find no good in him sylf / nor
in his own virtue / but he shall yield him sylf hoelly to the mercy of god and
axe pardon of his imperfection with a perfayt trust consydering how great love
Christ has showed unto him. And thus doing he ge^^e^h an hope and trust in the
goodness of God / and beleveth steadfastly that his sins are forgyven not by
his good works (for when they be compared unto the goodness required of God
there is no comparyson) but by Jesus Christ to whom he puts his trust. For
Jesus Christ possessith the kingdom of heven / by double right.

First for because he is the son of God and verey enheryter of his Royalme.

Secundly because he has gotten hit by his passion and death. Of this secunde
right he has no need / and therefore he gyveth it to all them that beleve and
trust in him and in his promyses.

For as God the father loves Christ he loves likewise all them that love him
and beleve in him.

So there shall none discomfort hi^ silfe when he shall dye but he must beleve
surely that he shall be saved. And albeit that one have not deserved by his good
works yet nevertheless he must beleve it because of the promise of god. for
god has promised it to all them that beleve it. And if we beleve it he owith
hit unto us because of his promise and because that he is true.

But if God had promised heven unto us because of our works we should ever be
unsure of our health for we should never know how much nor how long we must
labor to be saved and should be ever in thought that we had done to litell and
that more is we should never dye joyfully. But god would assure us of heven / by
his promise to the intent we should be certain and sure: For he is the truth
that can not lie. And also to the intent that we should have trust and hope in him
/ Notwithstonding that after the gretnesse and multitude of our sins it seem
to us a thing impossible yet alweyes we shall beleve it without any doubt
because of his sure promise. And whosoever knowyth this he may joyfully dye
and abide the judgment of God which else were yntollerabill.

How that we shall not sorrow for fear of death. Chaptre.xv.
THe health of a Christen lies not in this life or in that that one lyveth
long in this world / but rather in the death. For we can not be saved but by
death. Therefore the death in him silf is not yvill but is rather to be desired.
As did saint Paul saint Martyne saint Austyn and many other saints which
desired all the death for in this life there is no proufit / but alwey to sin
more and more / and alweyes unready to dye.

Therefore thou shall diligently study and exercise thy silf in this present
book / and in the faith whereof I have much spoken of and then forsaking thy
silf entyerly thou shall trust unto the grace mercy and good will of god
alweyes rather desiring to dye and to be with god then to lyve here any longer.
This shall thy sprite desire. for the flesh can not desire such things. And
so shall thou hold thy silf steadfastly unto god beleving that thou art his
child and that he is thy father and that thou belongest to him.

For God has bought the ageyn and has made the his child and his heir when
thou were yet his enymye. And if he have bought the when thou knew him not
how much more will he now take the to mercy when thou know him / and when
thou axest mercy with a steadfast faith and trust in him. And because a man can
not lyve here without sin therefore he can never satisfye unto God for his
sins. And for this cause shall the Christen willingly yield him silf unto the
death for the love of God: As Jesus Christ has done for us. And by such a
willing death which is taken with a good will by such faith and trust / and
also by the love that we have to God all sins are clearly defeated and put
awey. For none can do more great penance then to dye wyllingly for to fulfill
the will of God.

Therefore thou shall not be sorry for death / but thou shall forsake willingly
and with a joyful heart all thy goods and all thy friends for to obey god.
They that die with such a courage and such a trust in god it is a certain
sign that they be saved And to the intent that none should fear or be discomfort
by death / Christ is first deed him silf and has taken awey the power of death.
None shall have horror of the death / if he have this feith for it is now none
other thing but a door and enter whereby one goith from this life te^porall unto
the life eternal. For christ says by the mouth of the prophet Osee. Osee.
13 1. Cor. 15
O death I will be thy death. And saint Paul says. Death where is thy victory.

Wherefore yt is much to be rebuked the folisshe custume and manner of weeping
bewaylyng and taking of sorrow for the deed as though we had no manner of hope
or beleve on the other life. Let the paynems weep and wayle which have no hope
of the everlasting life. I mervayle that we be so much ynfideles seeing that
seint Paul teaches us not to be sorry for our friends deed saying unto the
Thessalonyans: My brethren we will not that ye be ignorant of them that
sleep that is to sey of them that be deed to 1. Tessa. 4
the intent ye should not be sorry as are other that have no hope. Behold Saint
Paul calls the death none other thing but a sleep from the which Jesus Christ
shall wake us at the day of judgment. And if we have such a feith / as is
that whereof I have now spoken of we shall be nothing sorry but rather joyful
when any dies. Whosoever is sorry for such thing he synneth. For he is sorry
that the will of god is done. Then let none be sorry therefore for it is but all
folly and infidelite.

Thou shall not ordeyne where thou will be buried or whate stone thou wylt have
on thy tomb for it is all pride and vaynglory and proufiteth nothing / ye yt
is great sin before god. For it is all one before god if thou be buried in
the church or in the churcheyard or in any other place. And all the pompes and
ceremonies wherewith the deed are buried is more institute for the proufyt and
advauntage of the lyving / then to help the deed. For they proufit or help
nothing at all unto the deed.

The best preparacyon unto death is to love nothing in this world / to set his
heart on none erthly thing: but so to entreat and use all temporal things
that one may be alweyes ready to forsake them and to love better to be with god
then here.

will thou now know who dies helthfully as far as man may have knowledge.
Me semyth after the scripture that when a man or a woman has loving
co^versacion with his neighbor / or if they be married to gyther in an holy
love / glad to here talk of god / giving willingli after their power for
goddis sake / and are not sorry or discomforted for the loss of their goods /
or of any other adversite willingly comforting the desolate and dies in a
steadfast faith and with good will it is to be thought that such a parsonne
should be saved.

Now forbicause I have much spoken of the faith and how we be the children
of god I will write how all estates should lyve / and of every estate alone a
doctrine after the Gospel and epistles of. S. Paul. And first of monks and
nonnes.

Of the life of Monks whate it was in times passed. Chaptre.xvi.
IN times passed there were no holyer parsones then monks. And all they that
would lyve according to the gospel were wont to gyve them silves unto that
life because they had a more gretter occasyon and help to lead a good life /
then with them of the world. A parsone might better keep his symplicite /
chastyte / sobryete / humilyte and other virtues in such assemble of holy
parsones then he coud do among the seculers and worldly which sought but
things carnal. So was then the life of monks the fontaygne of christendom.
But thou must know that the monks of that time were all other then they of
this present time. They made no vows no^ promyses as they do now. None was
then constreyned to chastity or to other virtues against his will. They were
subject and obeysaunt unto the commandment of their Abbot willingly as
though god had commanded them. For their superyours commanded them nothing
but the commandments of God and of the Gospel.

And because I may not rehearse the life of all Monks I will speak here
of.iiij. manner of Monks / to thyntent that ye may know how the life of monks
is changed.

The first monks was Helyas and Helizeus / the sons of Ionadab / the sons
of the prophets / saint John Baptist / and other like. They were parsones
lyvyng in abstynence / in wilderness. But the life of them has no manner
similytude unto the life of our monks now a days.

Not long after that our savioure christ is ascended unto heven / is there
come an other sect of Monks / of whom writes Pi^^lo and Eusebius. These
monks had their beginning of the disciples of saint Mark. with them dwelled
wymen and lived to gyther separat from the people in sobryete / chastyte and
love. And they lauded God with reding of the psalms / with fastinges and
prayers: And lyved hoelly after the life which thappostles had first
enterprysed among whom all things were common. Acto. 4
As writes Saint Luke in thactes of thappostles.

Many have followed the life of these monks here as saint Effrem / saint
Machayre / saint Hierome / saint Heliodore / and many other holy parsones that
then were in the world as a man may perceyve in the books of saint John
Chrysostom.

Of such life was also saint Martyne with his brethren. They were not ydell
but writing of books and laboring with their hondes for to get their
expenses. They made no vows nor profession. Every one might eat fast and
read when he would like as did the seculers. They came many times to gyther to
communyon and prayer. They had no certain masses / nor hours to sing daily.
And when yt was noyous unto them they might avoyde out of the company / for
they were not constreyned there to abide by any professyon. And when a Bishop
or an herdman dyed they took custumably one of these monks for a new Bishop
and herdman / for they were then holy and lettered parsones.

After them came the third sect of monks / of the which was saint Benet /
Montanus / Gregory / and other monks / of the order of saint Benet. In that
time was the life of monks sum whate charged with a certain nombre of Psalms
/ with certain prayers / with one certain habit and order and with other
ceremonies. Nevertheless saint Benet did not so charge his order / but
submitted all unto the discrecyon of the Abbot to dispense change and do all
things according as he should think it best convenient after the time. And
because they were men of holy life the ^ytesins took of them to their
pastores and bisshopes. So came it afterward to pass that the princes and
great parsonages have had favor and love unto the cloisters / and have gyven
them much goods and possessions / and have founded new monasteryes / so
that they be thus multiplied in the world / as thou may see. And because
that to much goods and possessions have be gyven unto the^ their good
discipline and life is by little and little brought to naught and corrupted by
richesse. So that they have enterprysed to make sumpluous bnyldinges / costly
vestmentes / and have begone to eat and drink delyca^ly / have bought
precious vessels / chalices / and other ornaments in their churches. So have
they enterprysed to lyve / not as monks but as lords By these things here is
coled the spryte and love of God. Thus loving the sprite they have taken the
flesh ordeyning all their holiness in foreyn / and outward things / and
ceremonies / as in reding their hours / in singing / in kne^^g in habytes and
many other ceremonies. But humilite / contemptibilite / sobriety / pacyens and
poverty they have forgetten. And by such means is the life of monks come
unto voluptuousness and unto all vanyte by thabundaunce of richesse. Thus have
they begone to be ydell / and would not get their expenses by labor of
their hondes / as it was ordained at the beginning. Thus by ydelnesse are they
come unto all evell and perversite and by great hepes be they fled out of
their cloisters Monks and Nonnes. Then was it ordained (as it semith) that
before saint Bernardes time the monks did make professyon.

After that the life of monks was so corrupted came saint Bernard to cloister
and then were the monks reformed. Then did they ageyn diligently take their
astate and began ageyn to charge their order with profession and promise and
have made many statutes after the which they might live / and whereby they
might compel men thereto for the willing sprite was clear extinct in them.

After this is comen the.iiij. sect of monks. As Norbertus / saint Dominyk
saint Fraunceys. And of them are now comen many sects / as the observau^tes
/ freres minors / Collettes / and Mar^^a^s Saint Dominyk has been as fertile as
saint Fraunceys. And thus be the cloisters and monks multiplied without
no^bre. But the gretter that the nombre of monks and nonnes has been the
gretelyer has virtue and charity ben minisshed for they have begone to make
divysions and parts the one against the other for to know which of their
ordres were most holy and better then other and many other folyes.

After this have the monks gotten popes and cardynals of their relygion. And
also they have purchased and gotten to the despyte and contempt one religyon
of an other many privileges / pardons and auctoritees to make co^frayries for
the seculers whom thy make parttakers of their good works as though: they
did more then they are bound to do. Notwithstonding that Christ him silf
says in the gospel: Lu. 17
After that ye have done all that to you is commanded: yet sey ye: we be
vnproufitable servauntes we have done but that which we were bound to do.

Thus are the cloisters and monks multiplied / and all charity among them
mynysshed. In times passed was the life of monks a departing from the world /
and now they are called monks which in the mids of the world by and sell /
judge / drynk / eat and be conversaunt like seculers / and yet will still be
called monks or racher religious. They do the better to be called religyous
then monks after the life that they led now. for monks after the greek
word signyfieth solytary or lyving alone as they were wont to lyve before
times when their life was good and holy. But religyous after the la^yne is
bond and subject. For whate is now the life of the religious but a
supersticious subjection unto certain vain ceremonies. Therefore they may now
by good reason be called religious that is to sey captyves imprisoned in a
ceremonial life and all Indaicall / forasmoche as they keep not their order
liberally / and willingly / but for the most part by constreynt. But there
intent is not to be called religyous sor this cause. For this word religious
betokens sometime / holy and gyven to the servise of god. And therefore they
would so be called entending to be taken more holyer then other. Albeit that
thappostell sey: If any man think that he is sum whate when in deed he is
nothing / the same deceyveth him silf in his imaginacion.

Alweyes in old tymereyned all virtue among the religious. They haunte^ not the
worldly people and therefore might they well be called monks / that is to sey /
solitaryes living alone and also religious that is to sey holy and bound unto
all virtue. But now ye shall find no where no gretter eaters / banqueters /
drinkers (I dare not sey dru^kardes) chidinges nor envy the^ among them. They
think that when they keep their rule outwardly in habit / kneling / becking
/ singing / reding / fasting / seying of mass / and in other semblable
ceremonies / that they be then saints and virtuous / albeit that all these
things thus done without the sprite and fre will be nothing else before god but
supersticion pride and ypochrisie.

Thus do they daily increase their supersticious ceremonies trusting therun to
because they have not the same feyth and sprite that the religious had in times
passed. Beforetymes the love of God stered them to do such things. Now they
do it all of a necessite as though they could not be saved without such
things / making to them ydols and Gods of the works of their hondes. Then
how is it now a religious life? I se nothing wherefore one should enter ynto
religyon.

Whether the life of a Monk be better then the life of a common Eytesyn.
Chaptre.xvij.
THe life of monks as it is now used in the world is none other thing but a
sect and theryn lies no more holiness then in the life of a good householder.
wherefore the state that the monks become to now a days is much to be
playned. And if thou will know that I sey truth compare the life of a good
honsholder unto the life of a good monk / and behold which agrees most unto
the doctrine of the gospel. The monk is obeysaunt unto his Abbot / Pryour or
warden. The householder unto his pastor or herdman in that it pleasith him to
command him in fastinges holidays and such like and that many times more
willingly then the monk to his Abbot.

The monk promyseth povertye but he never wants as seith Saint Barnard. He
is fed and nourisshed of the goods of other gained by the labor of other.
He gyveth to none but receyveth every where. The householder lives not of
alms as does the monk or friar but gayneth his lyving with the labor of
his hondes / ye he gives alms according to his power. So is better herin
the householder then the religious: (...) 20
For Christ him silf says that it is more blessed to give then to receive.

The third thing that the monk promises is chas^ite / nevertheless the
state of matrimonye pleases god also / for he himsilf has institute it. The
monk promisyth to keep the rule of a man. The householder is content with the
promise that he has made at the font of baptesme so that he may keep it well.
For the good life lies not in much promising / but in kepi^g well that which
one has promised. The monk reioyseth because saint Fraunceys or saint Dommike
is his superior. The householder holds god for his superior. The monk has
the rule of a man. The householder the rule of god / that is to say / the
gospel. Then why will the Monk hold him silf more holy then the common
householder? God is egally like nighe unto all them that love him with all
their heart and lyve according to the gospel ^ be he monk or chanone /
reguler or seculer.

The Abit of Monks nor their ceremonies can not help them when their heart
is not good / likewise as the seculer abit ca^ not hurt the seculer man when
the heart is spiritual. For the perfection of Christendom lies not in mete
or drink or in other outward works / as is fasting / praing with the mouth /
watching / reding / synging / making obeysaunce with the head / kneling or in
any other outward thing semblable. As testifies saint Paul unto the Romans /
saying: The kingdom of god is another mete nor drink / but it is
righteousness / peace / and joy in the holy ghost. If thy heart and intent
seche none other thing but the honor and will of God / if thou rejoice that
thou may do and suffer all thing for the love of god then art thou sure that
thou love God and that he loves the.

This let every religious k^owe that he may not think that he shall be justified
by his outward works / or that he is any thing better then the seculer man: As
at this day (god amend it) we se that many religious esteem them silves so
holy / as though they alone were christen. And hereof many times the seculers
are cause which plain their life when they behold the life of the religious.
They praise the state of religion because they regard only the outward works
and pleyne that god has not called them to such a life. when the religious
here this they glorify heryn trust in their works and think that it is even
so and that they be more holy the^ the other.

This is the most dangerous temptacyon that a religious may have for by this
temptacyon they begin many times to trust and abide upon their good works
notwithstonding that they be often done against their will which can never be
good. As at this day we se how many monks and nonnes lyve in their cloisters
against their will: And all that they do proceeds from an heart constreyned and
not voluntary. And out dare they not go for shame because they have otherw^se
promised. And they curse oftymes all evil to them that have counceyled them
and brought them into that religyon / and would feign that their cloister
were bu^ned. And so be they never content in their heart nether can find any
rest of conscience and be then much ferther from god then they were when they
were seculers. Such people oftymes do many evelles toward them silves by
impacience and rebellion against god. They do nothing by. love that they have
to god or because that they beleve them silves to be the children of god but
only by constreynt and against their will. And when they must dye they trust
and stikke upon such works by them done against their hearts and by
constraynt of their order and think even thus.

Behold dear lord: my life has been to me hard and bitter: I have oftymes had
evil will: I have alweyes abiden in my Cloister / I have kept mine order / I
have valiantly fought unto the end / gyve me now the crown of glory / and
the everlasting life. In all the world is there not a more dangerous sin
then this perversyte and ypochrisye.

It were better for such people to void from their cloister: For sinners
knowing their sins and requyryng pardone and grace be receyved unto grace
where as such ypochrites are reproved of god: As we may sein the gospel where
god received unto grace Marye Magdaleine / saint Matthew / the good thief and
meny other open sinnars: But he has lest the scribes and phariseys in their
blyndnesse which trusted on their works.

Ye fathers and mothers behold well whate ye do when ye put your children in to
religion: For ye are causes of all their sins. And it suffiseth them not to
lyve alone in such abusion b^t they teach it them silves unto other / whom
they write in their confraynes and make the^ participant of their good works
which proceed often from an evil willed sprite which can never be good before
god for God will no constreined service. Nether is there any work agreeable
unto god but such as proceed from faith / charity and out of a willing heart.
And if God would have such a constreyned service he would constreyne the devels
to pray much to sing / much to watch much and to do such other things.

But god will none of our works / when he has not our hertes. And all the
works that we do daily be agreabill unto god if with all our hearts we love
hi^ / beleve and trust in him. And all the works done without such faith and
love be sin and dampnabill before god / and if we s^ikke upon them as
though they were good works. And so were it better for the to go out of thy
cloister and to be an open sinnar and to knowledge thy misdoing before god as
did the publican then so for to trust unto thy works as though god for them
did owe unto the the kingdom of heven.

But thou say: I have promised it I must abide. Iudi. 11. Mar. 6
I sey again: None is bo^nde to hold a promise which is contrary unto his
health: as did Iepte and Herod which had been better to break their oaths then
to hold their promyses. For none may promise nor hold a thing that is
contrary unto his health. S. Fraunceis and saint Dominike had lever that thou
were saved in keeping the gospel then dampened trusting upon thy works. And it
is better to be shamed here before the world then before god.

But whate is it that thou have promised when thou made thy profession? have
thou promised that thou will not live after the promise that thou have made at
thy baptesme? Tho^ say nay / But therefore say thou I am entered into
religion for the better to fulfill the promise made at baptesme. Then when thou
perceyvest that thou live worse in the monasterye / then thou did when
thou were seculer / whi^ dare thou not take ageyn the life and astate wherein
thou may work better for thy health without offending any parsone but rather
amend other? Or if thou be entered into religion for to seche the health of thy
soul and find there more noise envye drinking bankettes divisions /
hatredes then from whens thou came thou may alweyes sey I am come hither to
amend my life. And I find that I wax daily worse: therefore I will goo there I
may amend my life and serve God with more great rest of conscience. Therefore I
tell the that it is better to live well in the world then ill in the monastery
and to trust upon thy good works.

But thou must think not to leve the cloister to have liberty and carnal
pleasure but only to serve God more freely as says Saint Paul. Give not
your liberty an occasion unto the flesh. And none can give the better
knowledge hereof Ga. 5.
then thine ownr conscience when thou axest it counceil for it deceyveth none
but says alwey manifestly the troth.

The world has likewise his daungiers and his perilles and it is impossible to
live in the world without sin. Therefore when the religious seith that he may
be saved in his cloister / ^er him abide there although he have there much to
suffer. But when thou percey vest that in thy cloister thou workest against thy
health / thou may then return into the world without sin / and lyve
according to the Gospel although that it be great shame before the world: For
it is better to obey unto god / then unto men / as said Saint Peter in thactes
of thappostles. Act. 5


How it is that the Monks go not forward in spiritua^l life but wax often
worse. Chaptre.xviij.
Will thou know why they live now sloughtfully in the monasteries and
wherefore that there be so many that would feign they were out? This happeth for
none other cause but that they never entered for that intent that they should
have entered. One enters there of necessite / to have his expenses: An other to
become a great prelate: The third to live Idelly and to have good times. Many
for vain glory to be reputed holy / and devout / to be honored of the common
people / or so in preching to show them silves that they be wise. None takes
that astate with such a sprite and courage as sometime did saint Fraunceis or
saint Benet. And therefore they prouf^t nothing. But the longer they be there /
the more sloughtfull they wax to do good. For to be ydell and to be nourisshed
delicatly dulleth us and makes the flesh rebel / so that they are the more
inclined unto lubricite uncleaness hatred envye and slought then the seculers
that labor with their hondes.

Some se the religious read much praising watch goo wolwared and were meke
clothi^g: And this pleases them. They get a pleasure to serve god in such a
sort. They here sey that every body promises the kingdom of heven unto the
observauntes / so that they keep well their rule / and by this mean conceive
they sprite and courage / to learn this life because they consider not what
thing is promised them if they keep well the promises made at their bapt^sme.
And after that they be thus entered into the cloister they here of none other
thing / they learn none other thing but outward works / as reding singing /
watching fasting and other like ceremonies. They know none other thing but that
the sum of all perfection and health rests in these things. So think they
that they have the principal part of all perfection and that they are sure to
be saved when with great unlust and tediousness they have accomplisshed and
observed these outward things And because they think thus they abide hanging
and trusting in such things. And so come they never unto the holy and blissed
sprite of saint Fraunceys or of s^int Bene^.

They have never experience how it sto^deth with a spiritual heart: for they
know not whate thing they should do with inforth. They think that all lies in
outward works and because they come not unto the sprite therefore abide they so
coide we^y and slought^ull. And so recule they more bakward then they goo
ferward in goodness. And commonly when they have lived in their religion
twenty or thirty year they are less worth as unto the purpose of health then
they were at their enter. For they have naught gotten there but a good
estimacyon of them silf of their good works supersticion and ypochrisye.

They have not yet ones tasted the sobriety and little estymacyon that the
spiritual parson bears in his heart of him silf. for they abide alweys in the
flesh and in the lettre of their rule and of the commandments. And they
do naught by love nor with good heart. And as long as they keep thus their
order they are reproved of God with the Pharesey in the.xviij. Chaptre of Saint
Luke. Lu. 18


For if the law of Moses and the Ceremonies which God him silfe did ordeyne
might justify nor save none (as writes Saint Paul the Apostle in all his
epistles) how much less may a monk be justified by his rule and ceremonies
which be institute by men. wherefore we must search all in the heart and in the
sprite whereby we may be justified.

For the outward works which we do without the sprite be sumtyme called
flesh by Christ in the Gospel. John. ^.


Such flesh proufiteth nothing: it is the sprite that quykeneth as Christ
says.

That is to sey: All outward and forayne things seem they never so holy if yt
proceed not from the sprite fulfilled with faith and love. That is to sey: if
it be not done by Charity and love joyfully by the mocyon of faith and trust
that we have to God. All such thing seem it never so holy or have it never so
goodly apparaunce proufyteth nothing but rather hurts and makes an
ypochryte. For seeing that god is a sprite he lovith nothing but that which
proceeds from the sprite as he him silf says in the gospel.

Saint Paul ostymes calls such outward works elements that is to sey Ga. 4
Commencementes and entrees into christendom: as though he would sey that such
things are ordined and institute for them that begin to take upon them the
christianite: As the children of the scole learn first their. Col. 2
A. B. C. He warns us also that we suffer not our silves to be deceyved and
that we serve not nor abide subjects to such elements / but wills that we
should proceed unto the sprite. For whate proufit should a scoler hane to abide
all his life in his. A. B. C. and learn. no ferther? No more proufit bring the
works without the sprite and feith. Moreover our savior Christ calls them
man's constitucions saying. Mat. 15
They honor me in vain teching doctrines and commandments of men. 1. Tim. 4
Saint Paul also calls them bodily exercitacion / that is to sey things
whereby our body is only exercised / busyed and let to do worse. They of
the^ silves proufit nothing unto our souls: For he says / exercitacio^ or
bodily labor is litell thing proufitable / but meekness proufiteth to all
th^nges. And this is because that we do it with the body only and that thereby
our heart and sprite is not turned to god. Such outward works are much
mocked of the prophet Esaye / where he speaks in the parsone of god in this
manner: Esa. ^
Offer me no more sacrifice: Sense to me is abhominacion: I will no more suffer
the festes of the new moan / nor of the sabbat / nor other festes: My soul
has hated your calendes and solempnitees. And ageyn: Heven is my seat / the
earth is the fotestole of my fete: Esa. 66
whate is the house that thou can bild to me? And which is the place of my
rest? My hond has made all these things says the lord God.

But whereunto shall I take regard but unto the pore and contrite sprite and
unto the fearer of my words. He that makes sacrifice of an ox as he that
slew a man. He that kills a sheep as he that brayned a dog he that offreth
oblacion as he that offered the blood of a hog. He that remembers the
eusence as he that blissed an ydoll. They have chosen all these things in
their ways and their souls have taken pleasure in their abhommacions.
wherefore I will also reherce their illusions and deceites. And I will bring
unto them the things that they feared bic^use I have called and there was
none that answered I have spoken and they have not herd. Think well on these
words you all that make such estimacion of your Ceremonies / festes /
oblacions / sensinges / and all other outward works. for albeit that ye will
sey that all these words be spoken of I^es that abode obstinate in the law of
Moses: shall they not? ye / ought they not? Likewise to be understand of all
them that follow the I^es in such rites? As do all they that think to do
great pleasure to god by their ceremonies / sumptuous bildinges singinges /
pleying at the organs / sensinges / diversitees of abites and a thousand other
dreams / which things may be done by any envious parson proud parsonye
verily also by a murderer or a the^e as well as by a verey christen. But to
love god with good heart / to recognize his imperfection / to pray for his
enemies to socoure by verey love his christen brother / to ^ere patiently and
with a joyful heart all that god sends: these things can none do but he that
is all holly given unto god They that be such be only verey religious before
god. For only such do fulfill there rule. For they do observe it and keep it
joyfully / and with a will fre and good. But otherwise when one does all by
constreynt and tediousness it is but a small comfort.

But that there be now so few religious having the verey feling of the sprite
/ this is for none other cause but (as I have seid before) forbicause that they
e^tre not with such a courage and intent as they should do and that they be not
enstructed as it aperteyneth.

Therefore whosoever will enter ynt^ religion let him be ware above all things
that he enter not upon thintencion to deserve the kingdom of heven by his
watchinges / fastinges / abstinences / prayers / singinges / redinges / and
other things like. For if the intent be such / he trusts in his works / and
becomes an ypochrite. And the more he does of such works the more great
ypochriste he becomyth And so abides he alweyes a merchaunte with god for he
serves for wages. But if thou will enter into religion thou must do it for the
love of God because god has made us his children for to thank him ageyn and
to fle the sin which reyneth among the worldly. For he that does thus he
thinks that he can never do service enough unto god for that he has receyved
already: for love knows no measure. He labors not for to get the eternal
life as the merchaunt for his wages / but only to give thanks of the
goodness that god has done unto him already because that he beleveth and
knows of troth that he is the child of God and his heir.

And therefore when any has the feith whereof we have before spoken he is to be
praised that by thankfulness does separate him silf from the world for to fle
the daungyers thereof. For the world has a thousand occasyons to sin /
principally for young people. Wherefore this is not a thing to be dispraysed that
a parson yield him in a good religion to amend his life. But if one find now
in the Monasteryes more debates / drinkinges / banquettes / pompes / hatred /
envye and ypochrysye then in the world it were much better to abide out / ye
or if one be entered to void out rather then to learn there to haunt such
life. For one must go thider to amend his life / not to wax worse.

But thou may say: I have made profession and promise: I must abide. I have
seid before that none is bound to hold / ye that none ought to hold any
promise that is contrary unto his health. Harken to this that saint Paul
says: 2. Tessa. 3
We command you brethren by the name of Jesus Christ that ye withdraw your
silves from every brother that walks inordinatly and not after the
institucion which ye receyved of us. And ageyn: If he that is called a brother
among you be a fornicatour or covitous or a worshippper of images 1. Cor. 5
or a rayler or a dronkard or an extorcyonar / with him that is such see that
ye eat not. And in an other place: God has not called us to lyve in strife
and discencion but in peace and love.

Osparentes that will put their children into religion. Chaptre.xix.
HEre must we warn the parents that they be ware to put their children into
religion without advice which they do often because they seche more their
own proufit then the health of their children. For some do it because they
have many children / and to the intent that they may mary the other the more
richely they put one or.ij. having some bodily imperfection into religion Some
also do it to have honor by their children because they be made monks
prestes or prelates. Other do it by hope to be help and socoured of their
children.

Behold how that by such means there be so few that enter into relygyon
with such int^ncion as I have seid above. Hit is not to be preysed but gretely
to be dispreysed when by such occasion any enters into religion. Therefore
should the parents se first whether their children were enclyned thereunto or
not / and whether they did desire it or not^ and for whate cause they desired
it. for if they be not inclined thereunto why will thou lose the^ as though
none might be saved in the world?

How did men before that monks came into the world? And why were not
thappostles monks? Ye why were ye not monks your silves that would so have
your children? God (as says Saint Paul the apostle) looks on no man's
parson whether he be monk or seculer man or woman / nobill or ignobill / But
he only is agreabill unto God that loves him with all his heart be he
householder or priest / religious or lay yt is all one to him. And as Saint
Peter says in thactes of thappostles. Acto. 10
There is no respect of parsones before God.

And in these things are many times much giltye the religious that with
fair words draw yought unto their cloisters.

Some times the children them silves because when they se the religyous sing /
read / pray / watch / knele / avale their hedes and do such like things
they esteem that to do such things is an holy life. And get a will to do
likewise.

And when they have been there a year they repent that ever they there entered:
for they have not the sprite that may comfort them / and to avoyde they are
asshamed / and so make their profession against their will. And even as they
began with a cold courage / so abode they comunely cold and changed from god.
Wherefore it were well done to absteyne him silfe from making of such
profession unto thage of.xxx years / as biforetyme none was sacred a pressed
before thage of.xxx. years in which time one might prove him silf whether he
might keep his rule or not. for we see many young people promise chastity but
few can keep it.

Of the life of Nonnes and Chanonesses. Chaptre.xx.
ONe may se now a days many monasteryes of Nonnes in the which they sing and
read much. And this I merveyle at from whence comith their synging. For seeing
they understand not whate they sing I can not tell whate proufit it comith to.
1. Cor. 14
For saint Paul defends to sing in the church (that is to sey i^ thasse^ble
of the christen) but in a tongue that all may understand. Then the synging of
Nonnes / can not be agreabill unto God seeing that they do not understood it. No
manner spiritual joy can they take thereby nor none amendment but do all by
constreynt of their rule and against their heart many times seching nothing
else but vain glory Much better were it for them to read their hours in a
langage that they understood. for when the sprite is not adressed unto god the
synging or reding proufiteth nothing. for if synging without vndersto^ding
plesed God the birds / lutes / herpes and other instruments should much
please god. Then when any sings without understanding it proufyteth him
litell and therefore it were much better that the No^nes and other religious
did read and sing their hours and their psaulter in their comune langage.
Paula and Eustochium and also other ladies of whom writes saint Hierom did
read in their time their service in the latin tongue but that was because
they did well understand it. And here^y is it now come to pass that our
Nonnes singe and read in latin and most for vain glory because they
understand it not. They think that the latin tongue sounds more plesauntly
before the world. Now is there a thing in the life of the no^nes much to be
dispreysed and that which is contrary to the Gospel / hit is that they are so
sumptuously clothed and appareyld. It was the custume of old time (which I do
not approve) that such religious wymen went bareheded and bare nekked and so
came to church. This manner has the bisshoppes wisely reproved and changed /
and have ordained that they should come to church their hedes covered like
other wymen. Thus when any young woman promised chastity the bisshoppe covered
her head and her nekke to the intent that they should not be seen and that none
should couvite her. And because there were then no monasteries such virgins
kept them silves in the houses of their parents and went not out but with
their parents and that only for to goo to mass or to the sermon / or to
visit the martyrs in prison.

One might lightly know them by the clothe that they bare about their hedes
and nekkes.

After this Marcella and Paula did enterprise to bilde a monastery at Rome for
that such virgyns did not lyve without danger in the houses of their
parents. Thus has the cloisters of Nonnes taken their beginning which were
wo^t to get their expenses by the labor of their hondes. They sang not as
do Nonnes now a days but red psalms working. Thus served they God in all
obedience / chastity / labor simplicite / and meekness / Their raiment was
simple to dispyse the world. Their hedes were covered to the intent that they
might see noman and noman them. But now (God amend it) all is turned to
pride in such manner of blasing facyon and costly in all their appareill and
lyving which was gyven them in token of sobriety / chastity / and meekness
so that I can not see whate holiness there is in the Nonnes lyving as it is
now used in the world.

It is more agreabill unto the world then unto god. For simplicite
contemptibilyte / po^ertie and humilite which god requires is now bannisshed
and reproved. All is turned into pride excess and costly apparel as though
in these thinnges lay parpayt spiritualtye and holiness of religyon.

Of the Cloisters of Sisters / and of their life. Chaptre.xxi.
There be also diverse cloisters of Sisters whole life seems to be more
according to the gospel / For to labor with their hondes and to help one an
other by love is a christen life. And saint Paul bosteth him silf in his
epistles that he has gotten his expenses in the labor of his hondes exorting
us strongly to do likewise. As unto the Tessalonians / we have not (says he)
eaten our bread for naught and without getting of it. And heryn is better the
life of sisters then of the nonnes for they are alweyes diligent in their
labor as in spynning / knetting / wesshing / and other like occupacyons. So
should all parsones do. for to be ydell and to be, worth much is impossible.
And (as said saint Jerome) there is nothing worse in a good purpose then
idelnesse. And therefore they of Egypt would receive none to be a monk if he
were not ready to gain his expenses in laboring. Saint Austyne holds the^
for heretics that sey that religious should not labor.

But why are all the religious at this day so corrupted and dissolute but
because they are become so rich that they will no more labo^re. wherefore to be
much idell to ete and drink dilicatly / to have all manner of case and yet to
abide in goodness / is a thing impossible. wherefore when the monasteryes
shall be empouerisshed ageyn the monks will begin to labor with their
hondes / and then will the religious wax better. For bodily labor is
commanded to all parsones by the comma^nd^ment that God gave unto Abd^ when he
said: Gen^.^.
In the swet of thy face thou shall eat thy bread. Likewise says the
scripture that he that labors not should not eat. 2. T^ssa.
Hereby may ye se whereby it comes that the religious and prestes be so
corrupted. This is by none other cause but that they be ydell and have to much
good whereby all humylite and simplesse / that was in Jesus Christ and his
appostles in them is holly perysshed and quenched. But yet is there an
unperfection among these Sisters much to be dispreysed / it is that they
labor to make to sumptuous and pompous edyfices / monasteryes and chapelles /
will be easyly lodged / and are to supersticyous in garnysshing with great cost
there chapelles and aulters maki^g sumptuous altar tables altar clothes
courteyns and other things like which is all nothing but pride pomp and
concupisce^ce of the yien. As says saint Johan. John. 2.
And albeyt that some do it / of a good intent thinking by such things to do
great service unto god / yet is it all naught else but abomynacyon before him /
he sets not by such things. As witnessith the prophet Esaie. Esa. ^6.
For he loves all symplicite humylite and pouertye as well outward as ynward as
he has showed in all his conversation and doctrine. And this know ye my dear
sisters and ye also my relygious brethere^ that ye rob from the poor all the
goods that ye dispose and spend upon such pompous buyldinges and ornaments
of your chapelles for when one enters ynto your monasteryes one can se nothing
like unto the poverty of Jesus Christ which had not where he might rest his
heed. But contraryly your monasteries seem rather the palaces of kings or
princes then houses Luce. 9.
of hospitalite to harbor your silues and your* poor nedy brethren. Remember
ye not that good will require the blood of the poor of your hondes because
they dye for hunger by your outrage.

There is nothing that planteth covytyse in the hertes of the religious and
that makes them beg but this superfluyte and outrage for without these
things hereit were no need to beg they might get honestly their expenses in
the labor of their hondes and might do alms holsomly of that that they
should have superfluous / for they should find work y^o^gh: And unhappy were he
that could not get his expenses / for all the world would take pleasure to
help them to get it / and to se their holiness pea^ible symplicite and
conuersacyon. So truly should they live pleasing god and according to the
doctrine of the gospel. But one might say whate should they do if any
misfortune happened unto them as of pestilence or of other thing? I answer
you that it is a demand of vnbeleve. Think you that God would leve them in
danger? I certify you that in such a case he should not think him silf
happy that might not assist and aid them for the lord would move the hertes
to do it. For he never leveth his true servauntes and children in danger if
they trust in him. But now when one seith there sumptuous edifices so manyfold
garnisshinges of aulters and images courtey^s of silk and gold and many other
costly things which truly represent nothing but vanyte unto spiritull hearts
one can in no wise take pleasure theri^ albeit that the worldly make much
thereof and praise it much because they know but the flesh and lettre which
sleyth.

How man and wife shall lyve together a doctrine after the Gospel. Chaptre.
xxij.
Our savioure Christ has commanded nothing so streytly as to love one
another ye also to love our enemies / as it is written in saint Mathewe where
he says. Mar. 5
Love your enemies. Then how much the more should the man and wif love the one
the other which are but one body. Ephe. 5
Saint Paul teaches that the me^ shall love their wives. But (alas) there are
but few that know how they shall love the one the other. For if thou love
thy wife only because she is thy wife and because she serves and pleases the
after sensual appetite of the flesh in beautye / noblesse / richesse* and
such like / this is no love before god. Of such love speaks not saint
Paul: for such love is among harlottes ye among brute bestes. But thou shall
love her because that she is thy sister in the christen feith and that she is
enheriter together with the of the glory of god / and because ye serve together
one god because that ye have receyved together all one baptesme and semblable
sacraments. Thou shall also love her for her virtues / as shamefastness
chastity diligence sadness pacyence attemperaunce secresye obedience and other
gostly virtues albeit that she be poor of a small lynage and foul. For ye may
not love the woman b^t that is in her that is sey virtues and the grace of god.
Also thou may not hate her / but thou must hate the imperfection that is in
her as her vices detraction / lakke of shame lak of chastity vain and ydell
words / gloutony dishoneste sloughtfulnesse wrath pride and other vices.
Likewise shall the woman love or hate that that is in the man. The man shall
reprove his wise by good manner when she shall make any fault without hating of
her having alweis pacyence with her as with a frail vessel / as teaches
saint Petre. When such a good and holy love is between the man and wife then
shall the man be ^. Peti. 3.
the head and the woman the less. The wife shall willingly serve her husbond
as her lord. Ephe. 5.
The man shall love his wife and honor her as his own body. For although the
man be the head he may not therefore suppress and despise his wife but he must
dyligently defend her and kept her from ewill as his own body / he shall more
enforce him silf / that his wife love him / the^ that she fear him. He must
love her as god has loved us while we were yet his enemies and yet enfect with
our sins. So shall the husbond love his wife / albeit that she be foul or
difforme / he shall not be hard or cruel unto her but shall support her pacyentli
and shall warn her swetely. For if thou be head why will thou hurt or despise
thy body / that is to sey thy wife.

The man shall defend warn teach and conduyte his wife / taking head that
she clothe not her silf to sumptuously and po^pousely and that she were no
Ievelles / for vein glory. For wymen be naturally gyven unto such folyes unto
braguery and pride. It is not expedient that a christen woman should appareill
her outwardly as do the paymems for scarcely is she the wife of one man alone
that so costly does appareil her silf outwardly above her astate. Also they
that do so gyve unto many occasion of evil desires. And seeing thou have a
husbond why will thou go so to please other. Herin shall the man be the head
and lord over the woman and shall defend such superfluite and vain glory in
his wife. He shall teache her and exhort her that she do her diligence to please
by virtue and holy conversacion and not by Iewelles and costly appareil. For
with such things do the most folisshe wyme^ of all garnisshe them silves.

Therefore shall the husbond take heed that the wife keep measure herm. Then
shall the wife obey unto her husbond as unto her so vereygne / and shall love
him as her own body shall honor and fear him as her lord. For so was Sara
subject unto her husbond Abraham and she called him her lord 1. Pe. 3.
as writes saint Petre. So did Monyca the mother of saint Austyn honor her
husbond. And when he was wroth or dronken she tempted him not / but after that
it was passed she warned him of yt by sweet words. So should all good wymen do
unto their husbondes.

Thus shall there be no sensual or carnal love in the state of marriage but a
godly and a spiritual. Then shall both man and wife help the one other for to
get their expenses. The woman shall take care for that that must be done
within the house and the man without. For such a life is much plesaunt unto
god / as it is written in Eccles^astes in this manner. In three has my sprite had
pleasure which are approved before god and man. Eccle. ^5
The concord of brethren / the love of thy neighbor / and the man and wife
well agreing together among them silves. Such a life in marriage is pleasant
unto god for he him silf did institute marriage in paradise.

The man shall alweyes attribute somewhate unto the woman for she is a frail
vessel. They shall live sumtyme also in chastity with one purpose and accord
to the intent they may fast and pray.

It is also alweyes best that in marriage the like take the like. For if a poor
man take a rich or nobill woman / she would be the head / and that is against
the teaching of saint Paul. And if the poor maydon take a rich and nobill
husbond she is not fellow to him norlsady of the house / but a servaunt for he
knowelegith her not for his wife / but holds her as his servaunt and drugge:
And this is like wise against the theching of saint Paul. For by such mean
the woman has not gotten an husbond but a tyrant and a violent lord. Nether
was Eve made of the fete of Adam / but of his side. Nevertheless when the
rich is joined in marriage with the poor / and love well the one the other
after such manner as I have said so that the man be alweyes the head and that he
dispyse not his wife it is a christen life be they rich or poor / nobill or
unnoble. For in this matter the will of god is more to be considered then
povertye or richesse.

How the parents shall teach and govern their children after the Gospel.
Chaptre.xxiij.
NOthing in all Christendom is so necessary as to teach and govern the
children / as it apperteyneth. For for defa^te of governaunce of them comyth
all evilles into the world. And oftymes it is the fault of the parents that
the children be naught because that they keep not them silves from gyving them
evil ensample which is a great and dangerous sin. This is the cause of the
most part of the sins that be done in the world / wherefore it behooves that
the parents take good head that they govern their children well and ^rafiely
from the beginning of their yought* For heryn may they do service much
acceptable unto God.

Then first* shall the parents do their diligence to make their children to
learn good manners: And for to keep them from stameryng / lysping / and
pronounsyng their words by half / which vice comyth oftymes by their
nouryces which speak so to the children and which speech those children learn
and follow.

And this that they learn so in youth can they scarcely leve. Ye must also take
good head that no body make them a frayed of any thing in their yought: For
they be sumtyme ferefull all their life after. And when they become to thage
of.vi. or.vij. years at the uttermost / let one send them to the scole to some
good man that fears God.

Their parents shall often enstruct them of God: how that Jesus Christ
verey god and verey man died for us on the cross / and how that we shall have
another better life after this life here and how that god has made and
created all things and that all that is in the world belongs to him / and
how that he lends it us for to lyve with all and to use it well. And how
that it is he that nourissheth and entreteyneth us: And how that we must trust
and stikke upon him / and that he will keep us well from all evilles And so
shall they enstruct them by little and little unto the faith and trust in God.
And how that God is their father and they his ^hyldren / as we have showed
before:

Wherefore is much to be playned the evell custume that is among the Christen:
that they run into so far contreyes on pilgremages and leve their children
and meynye at home without head and governor. It were a thousand times better
that they abode at home / and learned their children in the laws of god. For
God requires not that we should go on pilgremages. he never commanded nor
pre^sed them. for it is nothing but all incredulite and lakke of feith that
makes us to run here and there and to ^^che God in one certain place which
is like mighty in all places. But god has commanded al his people to govern
and teach their children and their maynye / as writes saint Paul unto
Tymo^he saying: 1. Tim. 5
If any one take not charge and care for his own and principally for his many
/ he has renyed the feith / and is worse then an infidele or paynyme. Who is
he that would not tremble hering these words of this holy apostell O ye fathers
and mothers masters and mastresses take these words into your hearts for it is
great peril to be worse then a paynime and to renye the feith.

Take good head what servauntes ye take into your house. For your children
oftymes will become like unto them.

Take also good head that your many tell no vile ta^es / singe no vile songs /
nor speak no foul words for that does much corrupt the children. ye must
also be ware that ye do not array or clothe your children pompously to flater
them or to make to much of them showing them to much folisshe love. For
when ye gyve them to much of the brydell ye can not afterward chastise or
reprove them. It is expedient also that ye take heed / that ye clothe not your
silves to sumptuously: for if the parents do it: It proufiteth nothing to keep
the children from it. For the children will learn it of them silves by the
evil ensample of their parents. For when they see their* parents do it /
they think it is no sin: notwithstonding that their comyth of hit great
sin and much evil. Let not your child ^onne where he will but know alwey
where he is / and who is with him or in his cu^^pany / and whate thing he does.
Se that your child hanut honest games I say not rythe or nobill games / but of
good manners / and that they be thereto well instructed.

Suffer not your children to go to weddinges or banquettes: for now a days
one can learn nothing there but ryba^drye and foul words. For if it be so
that thou will not suffer thy child to come ynto a place where he may be in
danger to take hurt of his body: How m^che more art thou bound to keep him
from coming there where he should flee or hurt his soul. Thou sendest him to
the weddinges / where thou know well (as the world goes now a days) that
it is likely that he shall be hurt in his soul by hering of such words that he
shall with great difficultye be made hole / and yet thou wylt not keep him
thence. O world without wit.

Thou must take heed to whate vices thy child is most enclyned whether it be
to covetous pride or other uncleanness / and according thereunto he must be
warned and kept. Thus shall thou do thy diligence to apply him to virtue in
time whiles he is young for then may thou bend apply and coudnyte him as thou will. And if thy child be naturally enclyned to any virtue / thou shall do thy
diligence to entreteyn him and to avaunce him therein. Thou shall also know
that in the men children there reyneth commonly other sins then do in the
daughters. In the daughters reyueth most pride of beautye and of raiment: In
the ^oyes sloth drunkenness / and harlottrye. So behooves it that a good
father / and mother consider dilygently to whate thing their children are most
enclyned and to conduyte and warn them theryn. The parents ought also to be
ware that they be not to hard and rigorous unto their children to the intent
they make the^ not rebels disobedient and fugityues and then rynne they awey
vacabundes by the country as many do. They should cause them to learn an
occupacion whereunto they should have most courage and apt intent which should
be laufull without fraud and whereby they might honestly get their expenses in
time coming. This should be done in time before they be gyven to the scoles for
we se commonly that clerks will put them silves to no craft but become men of
war. And although that thou be rich thou shall alweyes make thi^ children to
learn an honest and laufull occupacion. for in so doing they occupye the time
of youth well and keep them silves from dronke^nesse hasarding and fighting /
and from other mischevous business.

And if by any chance they come to povertye it is good that they can some
craft whereby they may get their breed. And if it happon not unto them yet
shall they alweyes do sum whate that they thereby may the better help the pore
for after the scripture none may be ydell. For labor is a penance enjoined
unto all the world / not of man but of god / after that Aba^ had sinned. And
he that labors not should not eat after the scripture. Moreover at the
festfull days thou shall bring the children to the church to here the sermon
Gene. 3 2. Tessa. 3
And when they shall be comen home thou shall are them whate they have kept in
memory of the sermon. Then shall thou admonest them to lyve well and to put
all their hope and trust in God rather to die then to do any thing that is
against the will of god.

Thou shall also teache them the christen faith after the naner above declared
/ exhorting them to patience / charity and hope in god. And principally thou
shall learn them the contents of the prayer of our savior Christ called*
the Pater noster / and that in their mother tongue / that is to sey / how they
have an other father in heven of whom they must look for all goodness and
without whom one can have no goodness. And how that we may seek nothing in all this life / in all our works and in all our ententes but the honor of
this hevenly father. And how they must desire that this father would govern
all that we do or desire. And how that we must submyt all to his holy will.

And how that his will can be but good / and helthfull. Finally how that
above all worldly things they be myndfull of the contents of this prayer /
and set most by it of all other prayers. And for to do this the better thou
shall keep them from reding of all wild stories / of batailles / of love /
and other fables. Thou shall bye them wholesome books as is the holy Gospel /
the epistles of the holy appostles: Ye and in conclusion both the new and old
testament / that is to sey the hole bible in langag^ that they may understand /
and also this present book. And thus thou shall do to the intent that thy
children may accustume and learn them silves in the holy divine scripture and
drink of the swe^e fo^^taigne which is descended from heve^ And by such
means may thou poor out good water when they shall be old.

For if thou be careful and do great labor to get thy children their
bodily expenses as thou art bound how much more art thou bound to get them
there spi^^uail expenses of their soul which is made after the similitude
and image of god And the more that the soul is worthyer then the body / the
more gretter care must thou take to learn him his health.

But whate mete is better to nourisshe the soul then that of the gospel and
of the holy scripture the which only is the nutriment of the soul. Thou have
kept the body of thy child from fire and water when he was young: why will thou not now also keep his soul from peril. Iaco*
It were much better to be careful in this matter. then to run to Rome or to
saint James or else where on pilgremage.

For (as I have said) all this is infidelite. for thou have the help of God as
ready at home as else where and if t^ou pray him with a steadfast faith nothing
doutyng.

As says saint James. And if thou find not God in thy heart thou shall find
him no where. The parents can do not gretter service to God / then to teach
and learn well their children.

For herin lies great virtue. Hereby may one please god singulerly. Ye
parents also be ware that ye give not to much money to your children. And
that that ye give them take heed how they spend it and wheruppon. And when
they bring any thing home that is not yours / or if that they report any news
of detraction / ye must sharply reprove them. And when thou will do any
alms before thy house thou shall do it by thy children to thinte^t that they
may learn to serve the poor.

And when they have strived the one against the other thou shall cause them to
come forth in the evening to axe the one the other mercy and forgiveness. And
likewise shall they do when they have offended or angered their parents.
Thou-must be well ware that thy child grow not up into partinacite /
rebellion / or incredulyte: And that he be no fighter nor striver. and when
thou herest thy child swear / curse / strive / fight / lie or speak any foul
words or sing any rybaud songs thou shall reprove him sharply. The parents
shall alweyes labor that their children shall rather fear them for love
and reverence then for pnisshement and fear. For children that obey unto
their parents for fear of beting they fear them no longer the^ the stripes
and beting endures. As all they that serve god for fear of peynes they serve
him no longer then the peynes or tribulacion endures. And after that they be
delivered they return ageyn to their old sins. But the children that fear
their parents by dilection abide alweyes obedient by that same dilection. The
parents must be well ware that they strive not the one against the other /
that they swear not and that they speak none inordinate or dishonest words /
principally before their children / for when they learn any unhappiness in
youth they shall with great difficulty leve it in their age.

Ye may never show your silf sorrowful / wail nor make compleynt before your
children for loss of erthly goods or because ye have not good gains. For
when they here you plain for such things they get a desire and a love of
temporal things so that they take pleasure in nothing else but in temporal
richesse / and have sorrow of nothing but for the loss of such things for
they learn it of their pare^tes The child follows nothing so much as that
which he sees his father mother and other friends do.

Finally thou must mark verey diligently whether they have desire or will to
be married at the state of marriage or not And as ye perceive it so must you
incontinent help them and care for them that they may make a good manage. As
Abraham was careful for his son Isaac And forbicause that the parents be
many times not careful in such case it comyth to pass that so few come
chaste to the state of marriage / that their children be often deceyved and that
they have shame dishonor and sorrow of their children. And this is most the
fault of the parents which be more careful for the bodies of their children
then for their souls. And therefore they will in no wise that their children
be poor but seek rather to mary them richely then helthfully / and axe more
for temporal goods then after virtue good manners and goods spiritual. And
for to make them have good times they make them many times prestes or
relygious. And so for to provide them of the case of their bodies they are
oftymes cause of the everlasting pain of their souls. For none ought to be
brought in unto the state of prysthod / except he be first chosen to some
office in the congregacyon and that because that we might se whate life that
he ledith. This thing compleyneth saint Austyne in the book of his confessions
in the secunde Chaptre / that his parents were not careful for him in this
matter.

Of the life of the comune Cyteuns or householders. Chaptre.xxiiij.
IN all the world there is not a more Christen life / nether more accordaunt
unto the Gospel / then is the life of comune Citesins or householders which by
the labor of their hondes and in the swette of their visage get their bread
and expenses. 1. Tessa and. 4
for saint Paul reioyseth that he gained his bread in the labor of his
hondes. And he rebukes the idell w^dowes that run about pleying from house
to house.

Wherefore it were much better among the christen that every one were set to
some occupacion / and that we should not suffer so many young and strong
parsones to beg their bread / but rather cause them to learn some
occupacion. And if that all young prestes / monks / and religious did likewise
it were nether sin nor shame. will they be better then saint Paul was and the
other appostles? we se now a days that they be forboden to work which is
Ga.1.
manifestly appostasie and against the christen faith. It becomes none to
forbid the^ to labor although he were an angel of heven / much less man:
The monks also were wont to labor in old time. It is plain that there be
to many prestes and religious in the world by half. And seeing prestes will not
labor / then if all the world were prestes who should labor the earth? I can
not tell whate holiness there is now a days in the life of prestes or monks
above the life of the housbondman.

The husbondes life is betrer now after the Gospel then the life of a great
part of prestes monks or freres. For all prestes monks and freres which
have none office that is necessary unto the christen^e do ^ate vnrightuously
the goods of the poor / and are called of Christ in the Gospel / John. 10
murtherars and theves.

But let us show unto the householders how they shall live holsomely. For it
behooves that they also know how they should live.

The householder shall first (whether he be husbond / crafts man / or
merchant) keep the rule that God has given in the gospel / that Mat. 7
is to sey that in all his marchaundise and in all his business he do to
another as he would be done unto not seking his own proufit to the hurt or
damage of an other. He shall never dispreyse his neighbors goodness but
wisshe him as much good as he would have him silfe Thus commands us saint
Paul that 1. Tessa. 4
none oppress or disceyve his brother in any manner because the lord god is
vengear of all such. for we be all brethren and me^bres of one body. Therefore
thou shall be ware to striveo and to move any manner of dissension with thy
neighbor be he rich or poor / noble or ignoble. for we be all like nobill
before God / because we have all together one father. Ga.3.
For saint Paul says ye are all one in Christ. And therefore shall none
despise the poor / nor cast his povertye in his teth / but shall socoure him
with his goods and comfort him alweyes in his povertye. If thy neighbor or
christen brother be sike and poor thou shall often go to him and comfort him /
distributing to him of thy goods according to thy power. Thou shall be ready to
serve him and to gyve thy life for him / as says saint John: Here^y know we
the love because he has given his life for us. ^. John. 3
And we ought also to gyve our lyves for o^re brethren. And if thou have
nothing to gyve unto him / thou shall gyve knowledge thereof unto them that have
/ and shall exhort them to socoure this pore parson. Biforetymes it was
accustumed to gyve knowledge to the pastor or curate of the church which did
socoure the poor with the treasure of the church / whereof was made mencyon in
the life of saint Laurence and of saint Gregory / and when there was no more the
bishop took the chalices and the other vessels of gold and silver / brake the^
and distributed the price thereof unto the pore: The bisshoppes also were wont
to warn the ^ytesins that they should gyve him knowledge when any were diseased
or syke.

But now (God amend it) it is all otherwise / the Bisshoppes take care of no
such things / the treasure of the churcheis spent ^gilding of images / in
founding of gre^ prevendes / in bilding of tabernacles / in ^ostly auter tables
/ and such superfluous ^rodigalite. And thus are the poor mem^res of Christ
deprived of that that to the^ ^pperteyneth. O world blind and Idola^rous. The
poor were not wont byfore^yme to axe alms: For they that were strong were
compelled to labor / and ^he old ympotent poor widows and or^hantes were
kept and sustained of the ta^le of the poor which they called the tre^sure of
the church / as teaches. 1. Cor. 16
S. Pau^e writing unto the Corinthiens councey^ing them to assemble a treasure
for the poor. This was also institute of thappo^^les to the intent that the
infideles that we^e conversaunt among the Christen should not mock the Christen
when they saw them have disease saying that there was ^o Charity among the
Christen / because they did not socoure the one the other: therefore they axed
none alms at that time If were also good now at this day tha^ we should not
suffer them that be young and strong parsones abill to get their living to axe
alms. for the world is full of such idell people.

Our lord both now at this day the ^silf same miracles that he did when he
sed^ such a great nombre of people with.v. loves and.ij. fisshes / albeit that
by our unkindness we regard it not. Mat. 14
for there are ^^ve parties of the people in the world / and one part of the
same.v. parts nourissheth and keeps the other.iiij.

The first party be prestes / monks / chanons / freres and clerks. They get
nothing but spend all.

The secunde are the lords / counceylours / governors of contreys / and other
rich people that lyve of their rentes.

The third be ancient people / impotent and children.

The.iiij. be men of war theves / murtherars / ruffiens / common wymen and
baudes. All these get nothing but spend all.

The.v. ce common Cytesins / artificers and husbondme^ that by their labor get
^heyre own expenses and also thexpences of the other.iiij. parts. And so it
behove^h that one parsone must nourisshe fyve.

If it were not that god provideth meruey^^usly for our necessite how should
it be possible? For this cause have I said that the life of Cytesins /
householders / and husbondmen is most wholesome after the gos^ell. It behooves
alweyes that the hous^older come in socoure unto his neighbor and that he
serve him and comfort him as I have seid before by charity. For we be^l
brethren together and members of o^e body. And therefore shall the good
christen be as sorry of the hurt of his neyghbo^^ as of his own. To. ^^
As says saint Paul. Rejoice you with them that be joyful / and weep with
them that weep.

And if thou know that thy neighbor is of evell life / and that he give evil
^^sample unto other / God commands ^he in the Gospel that first thou shall
war Mat. 1^
(...) him between him and the alone swete^y praying him that he will amend
him. And if he here the and obey unto thy co^nceyte (Jesus Christ says that)
thou has^ won thy brother. But if he will not here the thou shall call.ij.
or.iij. friends and shall reprove him in their presence. And if he will not
yet obey thou shall tell it (says Christ) unto the congregation that he may
be openly reproved. And if he yet abide obstynate not wylling to amend him then
shall thou take him for an hethen and public synnar. This is the brotherly
reprehension the which Christ has learned us in the gospel. Some man would say
if I should do thus to my christen brother he would be angry with me and fight
with me. I tell the to avoyde that / thou shall be ware to warn him
dispitefully or in mocking him. But thou shall pray him swetely and brotherly
showing him how that a christen should lyve. And if of adventure he slew the
in s^che a case thou should dye for the troth as did saint John baptist /
and so were thou Mat. 14 John. 14
gods marter for god is the troth. The householder shall laud and render
graces not only because that he is descended from a^ high rich or noble
lineage: but also because that he has made him to be borne in such astate that
he is feign to get his bread with his labor. For that is the life of a verey
christen. But he shall not put his trust therein at tall as though he were
therefore better then an other. for albeit that in this matter he keep the
commandment of God: It is possible that he kepyth yt not in other things /
wherefore we must alweyes be verey studyous to abide in humylite.

God might nourisshe us without our labor as he nourisshed the.v. thousand
persons in the wilderness and might keep us well without having so many
occupacio^s in the world. But he has so ordained it for to entreteyne and to
move charity among the christen / because that the one has need of the socoure
of the other / as the baker of the brewer and likewise the brewer of the baker
and so of other occupacions / to the intent that we should so serve and aid the
one the other by love / and that we should not be idell. And therefore shall the
householder and every crafts man do his labor diligently and joyfully in
tourning all his labor to the honor of God / beleving that in doing his
business by such a good intencion he serves god and that his labor
pleases god and that by Jesus Christ in whom he beleveth and trusts. All
were it so that ye know that ye should dye that day ye shall abide at your
labor surely beleving that your labor is plesaunt unto god. Thou shall
think that thou may not do thy labor for covense / for to wax rich / for
to eat and drink delicatly or for to have good times For when thou labourest
with such an intent thy labor is not acceptable to god / but is great
offense. And if percase thou wax rich without care therefore thou shall thank
god / and use it to his honor but thou shall not labor principally to be
rich. Nether shall thou rejoice of thy richesse. Nether if thou be pore thou
shall not therefore be sorry / but shall do thy labor truly recommending all
to the will of god that he make the poor or rich after that he knows to be
helthfull unto the. Thou shall not be a bringer up of new facyoned garnementes
for hereby is the people many times enduced unto sin and unto the losing of
great expenses lost in waste. But thou may say: If I will have it / an other
shall make it: and then am I not fynder of the new facyon. I tell the ageyn
that none shall make it / for if thou would not make it nor none other / it
would abide unmade well enough. For this is not taught for one or.ij. but for
all the world.

Thou shall not d^spende thy goods vnproufitably in making sumptuous
buildinges or bying of costly household for vain glory or in making to
precious clothes / or in delicate metes or drinks. For all that thou do
thus spend outragiously / thou robbest it from god and from the poor. Thou
may not abuse thy goods as thou will: for god has lent them unto the for
to use them in all reason / and for to socoure the poor with them: As
teaches saint Paul. Thou shall clothe the eat and drink after the most
resonabill custume of the country where thou dwell and after the manner of
thinhabitau^tes the it. For this may thou do after the Gospel. Thou may
never lie / swear / nor do nothing that god has defended for to get temporal
goods. Thou shall not count at evenyng how much money thou have gained / but
how much thou have prou^ised in goodness and virtue / and how much
goodness thou have lost in that days journey.

Thou shall not vex or greve by justice or otherwise the pore that owe unto
the for thou may not do it without sin.

As Christ says in the gospel. Mat. 5
Resist not (says he) unto the evil. But whosoever streke the on the right
cheke turn to him the other. And he that will draw the parforce into right
and take awey from the thy cote give hi^thy gown also. And he that
constreyneth the to go a mile with him / go with him twain. Give to him that
axeth the. And f^e not from hi^ that desires to borowe of the. Also it is
said more in the same chapter: Love your enemies do good to them that hate
you. for if ye love the^ (says he) that love you whate great thing do you:
do not the nethen even the same. Moreover Saint Paul unto the Romans. To. 12
Bliss them that persecute you / Bliss them / but curse them not. And
ageyn: Yield not evil for evil circumspectly brynging forth that is honest in
the sight of all men / And if it be possible as much as is in you to lyve in
peace with all men not revenging your silf my welbeloved / but give place unto
wrath. Hebre. 10
For it is written: To me be the vengeance / and I will render it says the
lord God. And if thine enemy be hongry gyve him to eat. And if he be thursty
gyve him drink. Be not overcome with evil / but overcome the evil with good.
1. Pe.
Saint Petre says also. None shall yield evil for evil nor curse for curse.

These words and other like seem to mean (ye they will) that the good
Christen shall not defend them silfe by justice in no manner for any manner
wrong that they suffer of the evil but should recomend all unto the good will
of God / which shall defend them and rule all things for the best / and
more holsomely and ryghtuously then all the judges of the world. But of this
matter will we speak in the Chaptre of two manner governementes.

Thou shall oftymes lift up thy heart and thought to God as thou do thy
labor / and shall sey to him a short prayer / doing thy business with a good
will / and with a joyful heart.

or god has enjoined the that labor in paradise in Abam for a penance.
Gene. 3 Phi. 4
Be alweyes joyful in the lord / and merry with thy wife servauntes and many.
Herafter will we tell how the householder shall live with his servauntes / and
how he shall be obedient unto his prince in paying his taxes fystenes subsidies
or such other semblable demaundes.

How the rich people should lyve / an informacyon and teaching after the
Gospel. Chaptre.xxv.
HE that is rich and lives of his rentes ought first to know that he may not
use nor spend his goods as he will: for he is but a kepar and a dispensatour
thereof. For god has not given the that richesse for to spend it ontragiously
in mete and drink or in costly bildinges and pompous clothiges for vain glory
or to hasard it at dyse / and at other gamyng. But thy goods belong as well
unto the poor as unto the For God has sent the richesse ynto the world as
well for the poor as for the reche. For they must lyve all as well the one as
the other.

The rich be none other thing but dispensatours and dystributers of the goods
of God / as the lords of this world have their dispensatours. And therefore
when thou spendest thy goods outragiously in etyng and drynking and other
excess thou shall yield account before god at the day of judgment. For the
rich man of whom speaks Christ in the gospel / was dampened for none other
thing but because that he was not merciful and that he lyved evil of his
richesse being an ill dispensatour. Lu. 1^
Wherefore it behooves that every body be circumspect how he spend. For all
that folk spend so without necessyte is robbed from the poor. for saint
Paul says: when we have our fode and wherewith to cover us let us be
contented. Our nature is content with litell. And they that live so in
pleasure taking all their ease are not Christen. for they devour that which
belongs to the pore which are their brethren and me^bres of one body. This
let the paynyms do that use such voluptuousness plesaunce honor and worldly
vanite because they have no hope of a beter life. The christen shall not love
his temporal goods but shall use them to ministre unto his necessitees and
unto his neighbors ever giving thanks unto God to whom all belongs. And
the richer that thou art the more care shall thou take / for to the is given
more to keep then unto many other. The richesses be not evil / for Abraham
Isaac Jacob Job and David were rich but evil using of richesse is evil.

Of such rich speaks Saint James in this manner: I^. 5.
Go to ye rich / weep ye / wayling upon your miseryes / which shall come
upon you. And Christ in the gospel: woe be to you rich that have here your
consolacion. Lu. 6.
And in another place: Truly (says he) I tell you that the rich shall with
difficultye enter into the kingdom of heven: Hat.19.
And I tell you ageyn: It is more easy for a camel to pass through the yie of
a nedell then a rich man into the kingdom of heven.

Therefore let the rich take heed their richesse be not there everlasting life:
and that they have not an other thing after their death As had the rich of
whom speaks our savior in the gospel saying / A man was Lu. 16
rich and was cloted with purpure and silk and did eat and drink daily
costly meats and dri^kes: and there was a certain beggar called Lazarus lying
at his gatefull of sores desiring to be fed with the cromes that fill from
the bourde of the rich / but the dogs came and likked his sores. It happened
that the beggar dyed and was borne with angels into the bosom of Abraham / the
rich also dyed and was buried in hell And lifting up his yies when. he was in
his torments he saw Abraham a far of and Lazarus in his bosom / and he
cried and said: Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may
put the end of his finger into the water to cole my tongue / for I am torme^ed
in this flamme. And Abraham said unto him / Son remember that thou have
receyved thy goods in thy life / and Lazarus evil therefore he has now
consolacion and thou art tormented. Thus gyveth God many times to them that
shall not be heirs of the everlasting life the richesse and prosperity of this
world / and pays them there with.

Therefore shall not the rich be proud of his richesse: but shall be alweyes in
care fearing lest god should pay him in this world and that he shall have noue
other thing. Tim. ^


Therefore says saint Paul unto Timothe: Command (says he) unto the rich
of this world that they be not proud minded and that they trust not in
uncertain richesse but in the living god which gives us all things
abundauntly to use / to do well / to be made rich in good works / to be made
ready to distribute that they may willingly have feloweship in those things
bisding to them silf a good foundacio^ in time couring that they may set hond
on the everlasting life. And a little before: They (says he) that will be
rich fall of times in temptacion and in the snare of the devell / and into
many vnproufitable and noyons desires the which tumble a man into destruction
and perdicyon: for the rote of all evil is co vitize / the which while some
folks desired they did err from the faith and wrapped them silves into many
sorrows. And many other places there are in the holy scripture the which
should strongly fear the rich and gyve great consolacion unto the poor. for
let all the rich know that when they socoure not the pore with their richesse
they do as great sin as though they robbed any body.

For god has not given them the richesse for to bost and brag therewith and
to make great chere nether to make them silves lords but to the intent that
they should be servauntes of all the world / and to help all pore parsones /
as are poor virgins / or young wyme^ at thestate of marriage to the intent they
come not to dishonor / and the pore young people to learn an occupacio^: And so
to give lend and socoure one an other. And thus teaches us saint John where he
says he that has the richesse of this 1. John. 3
world and sees his brother have need and shit ^ith up his heart against him /
that is to sey has no pytie of him / how is the love of god in him? As though
he would say he that sees his brother have need and helps him not / it is
not possible that the charity and love of god should be in him. Likewise says
saint Paul: Hebre. ^
Forget not hospitalite that is to sey to logge and help the poor) for some
thereby have received angels into their houses without knowing thereof. And
therefore shall thou not be asshamed sometime to call the poor out of the
streets / and to give them to eat and drink. Lu. 14
For it is the counceyle of our savior Christ in the gospel where he
forbids to bid the rich to the fe^t which may render it to us ageyn. But
when thou make a fest (says he) call the poor / the weke / the lame / the
blind / and thou shall be happy: for they may not render it to the ageyn: it
shall be yolden to the ageyn in the geyn rising of the rightuous.

But some man would now say: It is mine own I have gained it rightuously: why
may I not use it at my will? I answer the that is not true that thou have
gained it / but God has sent it the he has not made the lord of it / nor will
not that thou use it at thy pleasure. Thou art but only a dispensatour / for
to distribute it and to use it after the counceyll of the Gospel and of the
holy scripture / that is that thou shall use it without any manner of outrage in
thy house and out of thine house to all poor people as thou shall see need.
For that thou spendest other wise / thou robbest from God and from the poor
which are the members of Jesus Christ. And it thou do them any good thou
do it to the parsone of Jesus Christ. for it is seyde in the Gospel: Mat. ^^
All that ye do to one of my lest brethren ye do to me. Therefore he that does
good unto the poor he does it to Christ. And he that does evil unto the
poor / he does it to Christ. Thou can not employ thy mo^ey and alms so
well upon no thing (...) the world as on the poor. For the holy scripture
commands not to gyve it any where else. Our savioure Christ shall ^ot preyse
the at the day of judgment for ^one other cause but that thou have help ^he
poor in gyving them mete and drin^^ and clothing in vysiting them / and in
^y bing to them of thy goods when they were syke. Even as for none other
^^ing shall thou be reproved but for for^etting of the poor. wherefore thou
art ^ot bound to make to be song many ma^^s and obytes / to edyfye
chaunteryes / ^happelles / churches or aultres or to give ^^eringes to saints
or ca^dels of wax / for of all this shall ye yield none account though ye have
lest it undone. For the holy scripture makes no mention of those things. They
are rather invented by the covetous mind of men then otherwise.

As says saint John Chrysostom: Chrysostom
so give unto the poor whereof they may lyve and thou have edified a reasonable
house to God. for men dwell in bildinges but god dwells in holy men and in
men of good life. Also saint Iherome writing to one called Celautia: Ihero^^
when thou give socouring hand unto the poor / when thou come in socoure
to a man in his necessitees / when thou set hi^ that erreth into the right
wey thou have bilt a plesaunt temple to god. for the hertes of the holy
parsones be called 1. Cor. 3
the temple of god / the which whosoever (...) violat / god will distroye him.

wherefore ye rich people have ye alw^^yes mind on the pore. And se that ye
love better to bestow your alms whe^^ ye are sure that it is acceptable
unto god / and also where god has commanded you^ to do thsim / rather then
there where as y^ know not whether ye do well or evil as in making of images
chappelles pilgrimages obites and other man's in vencyons whereby the pore be
now a days miserably robbed and unkindly pilled by the^ that should aid and
help them if they did not search more their own proufit then the proufi^
and honor of god.

Of two manner Regimentes / or governaunces / goostly and seculer or worldly.
Chaptre.xxvi.
FIrst we must diligently search out the right and seculer power / sword / and
government to thitent that none doubt whether it be of the ordinance of God
or not. The words whereby we know that the secu^^ power is i^stitute of god be
these of saint ^^aule unto the Romans where he says: To. ^.
Every soul shall be subject unto the high powers / for there is no power but
of god. Then he that resists the power / resists the ordinance of God.
More^ver saint Peter says. 1. Pe. ^
Be ye subjects to every humayne creature / be it unto the king as unto the
sovereyne / be it unto the head rulers / as by him sent for ve^geaunce unto the
offe^ders but for preyse to them that be good. Moreover the right of the
seculer power and of the civil justice has bin from the begi^ni^g of the
world. for when Cain had slain his brother Abell / he feared much that he
should be killed ageyn. Likewise after the floude god confirmed it agein Gene. 9
saying whosoever shede man's blood his blood shall be shed agein. The same
right was co^fermed agein in the law of Moses where he said in Exode: Exo. 2^
whosoever strike a man willing to kill hi^shall dye of death And ageyn if any
with deed advised iying in a wait kill his neighbor thou shall draw him out
of my house / and that he dye. And in the same law it was commanded to take
away life for life / yie for yie / to the for to the / hand for hand wau^de
for wound / and so of other. Likewise has our savioure Christ in the gospel
confirmed Mat. 25
it saying to saint Petre in the gardeyn of Olivete: He that streketh with the
swerd with the sword shall perisshe. Then is it all certain and manifest that
it is the will of god that there should be a swerd and justice te^porall for
the punycion of the evil and co^^^vacio^ of the good and for the^terteyni^g of
the public peace christen and comune brotherly love. Secu^dly it seems to be
much contrary heru^to / that which Christ says in the gospel in this
manner: Ye have herd whate has been said: Mat. 5
In yie for anyie a toth for a toth: but I sey unto you / ye shall not resist
evil. But whosoever strike the on the right cheke tou^^e to him the other. And
to him that will go to law with the by force and take awey thy core / gyve to
him also thy gown: And he that will constreyne the to go a mile with him go
with him twain. And a litell after: Love your enemies say well of the^ that
^urse you do good to them that persecu^e you with hatred / pray for them
that hurt you and persecute you. And over and besides this there are yet many
places in the holy scripture for be doing all manner of ve^geaunce. As in saint
Paul unto the Romans. To. 1^ 1. Pe. ^. and. 3.
Saint Petre in his first epistle / and in many other places. Wherefore it
se^^eth that the swerd of justice should be for bode^ in the new testament among
the christian.

Then thirdly for to understand this well we must first know that there are:
^wo sorts of people in the world. The first belong unto the kingdom of god.
The other to the kingdom of the world. They that belong unto the kingdom of
God be all true faithful people in Jesus Christ and under him.

For Christ is king and lord in the kingdom of God / As techeth us the secunde
Psalm / and also all the old and new testament. He came also in to the
world to begin and to lest up the kingdom of god in the world. Therefore
said he to Pylate: My kingdom is not of this world.

And whosoever is of the troth hereth my voice. John. 18
And in saint Mark says he that the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of
God shall approach. Mar. 1.
And in Saint Mathewe says he. Mat. 16.
Seche first the kingdom of God. He calls the Gospel a gospel of the
kingdom of god / because the Gospel teaches / governs and keeps / the
same kingdom. Then they that are steadfast in the faith and in the love of god
if they obey unto his commandments have naught to do with the swerd of
justice nor of the seculer power to make them rightuous. And if all the world
were true and verey Christen (that is to sey) very feithfull there need no
governoure king lord sword nor justice. For whereto should they sarve seeing
that all true christian should have the holy ghost which governs and teaches
them to do no wrong / to love all the world / to suffer / and endure the
evell and iniurye of all the world willingly and joyfully / ye also the death.
And where as all persons are content willingly to suffer wrong and iniurye.
And where as there is none that does wrong nor iniurye / but where as all
persons do right / there is no dyscord hatred envy nor other discencion. And
there needs no right nor punycyon.

Wherefore it were i^possible that the swerd of justice should have ought to do
among the verey true christen / seeing they do much more of them silves then
any man ca^commaunde them or then any law or worldly doctrine can teache
them. As says saint Paul unto Timoth. unto the ryghtuous there is no law
set / but unto the unrighteous. 1. Tim. ^.
And this is thus because that the judgment and right of a verey true christen
fordereth and avaunceth more then all other ryghtes and laws: for it proceeds
from the holy ghost which possesses and inhabiteth the heart of a verey
christen. But the unrighteous do right to no man / therefore they have need of
right and of laws whereby they be taught and constreyned to do well. A good
tree needs not that one teache him to bring forth good fruit for his nature
gyveth it without any reching. Likewise are all the verey true christen natured
by the holy ghost and says that they do all things well and as it aperteyneth
more then any man can command them by all the commandments in the world.
And for them silves have they no need nether of law nether of right.

But some man might axe why then has god gyve^ unto men so many
commandments / in the old and new testament? I answerethe. Saint Paul
seith as it is said before unto the ryghtuous there is set no law: but to the
unrighteous that is to sey to them that are not yet true christian. And
forbicause that none is true and verey christian or good of nature / but be all
synnars and evil: As witnesses the prophet sayng: God has looked from heven
upon the children of me^ that he might se if there be any understanding Psat.
^3. Romans 3.
or seching god. All are fallen and are become abominable there is none that
does good no not one. Therefore god refreyneth the malice of the people by the
law that they dare not accomplisshe hit outwardly by work and deed according
to their evil will.

Mereover saint Paul gyveth unto the law an other office / that is that it
letneth us to know our sins / by the which knowelege a man is made meke /
and yeldeth him silf to the faith / and unto the mercy and grace of god as is
before seyde.

Fourthly all they that be not yet christen belong unto the kingdom of the
world and be under the law. In this nombre are all the evil christen which
seek naught else but all worldly pleasure and are called christen but they are
not so.

Seeing then that there be so few good Christen and so many evil people god
has gyven unto the same evil out of the Christen astate and out of his
kingdom an other regyment and governaunce / and has put them under the
sword that is to sey under the seculer power and cyvill right to the intent that
they may not acco^plisshe their malice when they would As a myschevous wild
best is tied with chains and bonds that he may nether bite nor stryke after
his nature albeit that he would saine acco^plisshe his evel nature which is
not needful unto a gentill tame best / for without the cheynes and without
bonds he does noue evil to no man.

If it were not thus (because that there be many m^ evil persons in the
world the^ good / and that the good do not resist evil) the one would devour
and put the other to destruction / in such facyon that none should be abill to
keep nether wife nor children nether yet be abill to maynteyn him silf. And by
such mean should the world in contynuaunce become wast and with out
inhabitauntes. For this cause has god ordyned these.ij. governeme^tes. The
spiritual the which makes christen and good persons by the holy ghost under
the king of that kingdom Jesus christ. And the seculer governance the which
^^ostreyneth the evell parsones to keep outward peace and to be tame against
their will. Romans
Thus teaches us saint Paul / to understand the swerd and seculer instice
saying the princes / are not to be feared to them that be good but unto them
that be evil.

Now if any man would govern the world (that is to sey the evil) only after
the gospel and cause to cease all worldly law and justice saying that they
are baptized and christen to whom the sword of justice needs not. Unto them
may be answered. Hit is of a truth that the true christen have no need of right
nor of the sword for their justifying. But do your dyligence to fulfill the
world with true christen before that you govern them christenly and after
the gospel which shall be verey hard for you to do. For the world is all
gyven to sin and starcely can they abide good christen. They are not all
christen that are baptized and called christen. Therefore it is not possible
unto the world to observe and keep a common christen governaunce / namely also
in the iuddes of a great comonte / for the evil are alweys more in nombre then
the good feithfull. For this cause to govern a country after the gospel
without the sword of justice is as though a man would put together in a stable
/ heries wolves lions sheep and other like / and to suffer all these bestes to
be conversaunt together the one with the other / how long I pray you should
they have peace to gyther the one with the other? Ye how long should the poor
sheep lyve / we therefore must needs have here both these governementes.

The spiritual or eva^gelye all because it justifies and brings health. The
other because it entreteyneth and holds peace The one is not sufficient in
the world without the other. For without the spiritual government of Jesus
christ can none be saved nor justified before god by the worldly regyment. So
may ye perceyve that the rule or governeme^t of christ has not lordship over
all persons. For the true christian be alweys less in nombre and be in the
mids among the not christen / as a rose among the thorns. Then where as the
worldly governaunce reyneth every where alone / there can be none other thing
but ypocrysye. For without having the holy ghost in the heart can none be made
ryghtuous nor saved. Likewise where the spiritual governaunce reyneth every
where alone / there is perversite unbridled and unbound ready for to
acco^plisshe all malice for the world ca^ not understood the spiritual
governaunce because that it fyghteth only by the sword of the spryte / which
is the word of god. And uses none other sword. Now see thou well whate
the words of onre savioure christ mean (which we have recyted before) where
he says that the christian shall draw noma^ in to justice / and that they
shall not resist evil. He speaks that only of his dear christian / the which
alone take it ynto their hearts and also do it alone for so are thy enolyned
and disposed by virtue of the holy ghost worki^g in their hearts that they do
harm to noma^ but suffer willi^gli^ evell and wrong of every man. Then if all
the world were such christian all persons would keep egally this peassible
co^ma^n deme^tes / and all thing would they do according theru^to. But now
because thy be not christen the word of god enters not ynto their hertes /
nor they do not according there unto and therefore they apperteyne unto the other
seculer governaunce where by the not christen be constreyned to keep peace
outwardly / and to do none evil.

For this cause has not Jesus christ ^orne the sword nor ordined it in his
spiritual kingdom / for he is king over all the true christen / ad governs
without sword and without any outward law only by the holy ghost working
inwardly in the heart of man. And albeit that god has orde^ned the seculer
sword for the correction of the evil / yet he has not used it / for i^
belongs not unto his kingdom / in the which kingdom there are none but
such as be good and just. And for this cause might not david bilde the tempel
of god because he had shed much blood and used the sword / not that he had
done evil or vnryghtuousnesse / but because he might not in this thing be a
figure of Ephe. 5.
Christ which should have a kingdom peasible and without sword. But god
commanded to solomon which had a peasible kingdom to bilde the temple / for
Solomon is as much to say as peasible by the which kingdom of the verey
Solomon Jesus christ might be figured and signified Moreover in all the
edificatio^ of the temple of god was never herd stroke of Iron / nor of hamer /
nor of Axe / nor king. 6.
of none other like thing as it is written in the therd book of kings in
the.vi. chaptre. All these things here sigrufied that Jesus Christ should have
in his kingdom a people willing to serve him without constreynt without
commandments without sword. Esa. 1^
This was also before prophesied by Esaie saying: They shall not hurt and shall
not sle in all my holy mountaigne. As^o in his secunde chapitre They shall
turn their swords ynto cultres and their speres ynto sythes.

The one shall not list up a sword agei^st the other and they shall be no more
exercysed in the^ war. These words here and other like be not said of al
persons that bear the name of Jesus christ but oneli of them that bear both
the name and the spryte of christ / that is to sey of all true christian the
which willingly do right the one to the other.

Now might one demand: Seeing that the true christen have no need of the
s^rde nor of the seculer right for their own ryghtuousnesse / then why
teaches saint Paul that every ^dule shall be subject unto the high powers:
Rom.13.
And likewise saint Peter that the christen shall be 1. Pe. 2
subjects unto enery humayne creature I answer the that I have taught before
that the christian among them (...) and they among the other have naught to do
with the sword nor with the law for that is to them nether needful nor
profitable. Alweys for because that the true christe^ly veth not upon the earth
for his own proufit but for the profit of his neighbor. He does by the nature
of the holy ghost that whereof his neybour has need And because that the sword
is a thing verey necessary for all the world / for to keep peace and concord
/ for to punysshe the offenders and to refrain their malice. Therefore the
verey christen yeldeth him silf willingly under the governaunce of the sword
and te^porall justice / he pays tailles he honors the puyssau^ce and
worldly highness / he serves he helps he does all that ever he may to
the intent that the same puissaunce may prosper be kept in honor and feared.
Albeyt that the same puissa^^ce to him is nether needful nor profitable. And
forbicause he thinks alweys whate thing is prou^^^able unto his neighbor /
that both he / As techeth saint Paul unto the Corinthiens. 1. Cor.10.
Such a service is the work of a christian and brings alweys great proufit
ynto the world. And if he should not do so he were no christian / but should
sin against the rule of charity / for he should gyve evil ensample unto other
that they should not honor the temporal puissaunce but should dispyse it:
Albeit that it should be alweys to them verey necessary and profitable whereby
should come great dispy^ing of the gospel. For such dispysing of the
te^porall puissaunce brings dissension and makes sen^uall parsones
profitable unto nothing:

The gospel makes all true christian serv^ ^ntes to all the world by the rule
of charity the which alweys in them silves and by them silves be in true
liberty and have need of nothing being suffised of their lord / and king Jesus
Christ and of his governaunce in them. Mat. 17.
So likewise did Jesus christ pay the trybute whereunto he was not bound at
tall to th^tet that he should not dispyse the puissaunce / and that he would
not gyve them occasion to be offended / but gave them exe^ple of obedience.
As he him silf teached in.v. chapter of saint Mathewe. Math. 5.
Where he seyeth that the christen shall not resist evil nor sue any man at
the law^. He forbids not to be subject and to serve them that have the
sword and seculer ^uissaunte. But the less need that thou have unto it for
thy silf the more shall thou conferme thy silf thereunto. Thou shall serve
theryn them which have yet need and are not so steadfast in their feith as
thou art and that only by charity supporting them in their ynfirmyte as
Christ has supported us / and has made him silf conformable unto us. For
albeyt that by the steadfastness of thy faith and love that thou have unto god
thou have no need that any man should punysshe thine enemy because that thou will suffer wrong willingly for the love of Christ. Thy neyboure has alweys
need because he is yet feeble and therefore thou shall help him / to him tent
that he may have peace and that his enemy may be refrayned and let that he
hurt him not: which can not be so done if the temporal power be not had in
honor and fear. Our savior Christ-sayeth not thou shall not serve or shall
not be subject unto the temporal puissaunce / but he says. Thou shall not
resist evil. As thought he would say: Maynteyne thy life so that thou be
pacyent that thou have no need of the law of right nor of the temporal
puissaunce for to revenge the. But contrary wise be profitable unto the weke /
and feeble multitude in serving them and helping them by obeying the temporal
puissaunce. I would that thou sholdest be so worthy and nobill to have no need
of the seculer right / but that that right should have need of the to help to
maynteyn hit.

Thus to use the seculer puissaunce should be a great work of charity whereby a
parsone is gyven hoelly to the service of his neygbour / and seeks not to
defend his own life honor or goods / but seeks means only to be
proufitable unto his neighbor. As writes Saint Paul unto the Corinthiens
saying. Charity seeks not that is his own / and this shall thou not do of
intent to render evil for evil / but only by charity for the co^servation
and defense of the common christen co^corde and unto the proufit of thy neyboure
not to revenge thy silf. 1. Cor. 14
For touching / unto thy silf thou abidest upon the gospel. Thou hold and
governest after the word of Jesus christ that is thy king. So that thou will
willingly turn the other cheke vere the blow pacyently and let thy mantell
go with thy cote / if it touch but only thine own business. Thus may it
well sto^d to gyther that thou be indifferently subject unto both kingdoms
(that is) of god and of the world: unto the one ynwardly and unto the other
outwardly / So that thou do suffer evil and wrong / and do alweys
punysshe and reprove evell and wrong. Thou do not resist the evil / and yet
thou do alweys resist it for in the one thou considerest thy silf and thine
own wealth. And in the other thy neighbor and his wealth. Touching unto the and
unto thy wealth / thou hold thy silf and governest thy silf after the gospel
/ thou suffrest iniurye and like a true christen do not resist the evil.
Touching thy neighbor / and his wealth / thou hold and governest thy silf
after the order of love and do resist the m^^rye which is done unto him /
which the gospel does not forbydde but rather commands it.

Many holy parsones have used the sw^d after this manner syns the beginning of
the world. As it is written of Abraham how he delyvered loath the son of his
brother Gene. 14.
and s^ewe.iiij. kings and yet was Abraham alweys an holy man. Also the holy
prophet Samuel slew / likewise (...) k^^g Agag. Likewise Helias slew the
false prophets of the Idol Ba^^. 1. king. 15
In like manner did Moses / Iosue / the children of Israel / Sampson / David
and many other holy kings use the sword as appears in the old testament in
many places / Some man might now say. 3 king. 18
The old testament is now ended and has no more place / wherefore we can no
more gyve such ensam^les nor set them forth unto the Chri^ten. I answer the
that is not true.

For faint Paul writes you his first epistle unto the Chrinthiens. Our
fathers have all eten one spiritual mete / and have all drunk one spiritual
drink: 1. Cor. 01.
They dronke of the spiritual stone that followed them / truly the stone was
christ. That is to sey they had the same spryte and feith in christ that we
have for they beleved then that christ was for to come to redeem theyme / as we
beleve now that he is come and has redeemed us. And so were they christen as
well as we. Wherefore seeing that they thus used alweys the te^porall sword from
the beginning of the world unto the coming of christ for to depresse the
outward malice of thoffenders / likewise may also the christen do unto the
end of the world. For the time and outward change make no difference among
the christen. The old testament is not so cessed that we need in no manner wise
to keep it / or that he does evil that observes every part thereof. But it is
so ceased that in some things and some times it is indifferent / and in some
things and some time it is of necessite to do it or to leve it.

Hit is not now needful to keep it in all points any more under pain of
dampnacion as it was then. But we must keep it only there where brotherly love
requires it / As when saint Paul circumsised his dis^iple Timothe which was
not needful unto him for his health / but he did it to satisfy the mind of
the feeble and weke Iues which thought that he might not be saved without that
he were circu^sised after the law of Moses to thinte^t that by that mean he
might draw the more of them to the christen faith. The old testament as
concerning the commandments gyven unto Moses is not yet ceased nor shall not
cease unto the end of the world. Hit is of necessite. that art thou bound
to observe and keep under pain of dampnacyon as they were in that time. As
concerning unto their ceremonies they are clearly ceased in Christ / so that
if thou would circum^^se they silf at this day and forbear such meats as
were defended unto the Iues to e^te and to do other ceremonies not having trust
to deserve any thing thereby / it is to the indifferent in so doing thou have
not ^ffended. But if thou shall come in the company of Jews or of other
parsones which reken that they can not be saved oneles they should keep such
ceremonies whom thou would feign win to the christen faith and have hope
and lykelyod in the same there art thou bound by brotherly love which hurts
noma^ but servith every man to keep their ceremonye with them and to do as
they do till such time as they may be better taught to know that all their
health dependith upon the faith and trust of Jesus christ and upon his
merytes and deservinges and not in these blind ceremonies. For charity
regards not whether the thing be new or old that thou do but only the
vtilite and profit of thy neighbor.

Of governors / Iuges / baylifes / and other like an informacion ofter the
gospel Chapitre xxvij.
THe gospel is written for all parsones and for all estates of the world. And
there is none estate in the world but that he may find in the gospel how
that he should lyve if that he will follow it. Let none think that he is not
bound to ^yve after the gospel though he be never so great a person / be he
duke prince Emperor or pope. For god has commanded that the gospel be
preached to every creature that is to sey to all mankind. Before god there is
no difference nether distinction whether thou be a common husbond man or a
governoure / of a town or of a country / noble or ignoble / we have all
promissed at our baptesme the one as much as the other. we have all taken one
rule that is the teching of the gospel after the which we must led and
govern onre life. we may not sey / let the monks and prestes keep it for we
have all promised at our baptesme the one as much as the other. Wherefore when
the lords will lyve as they shu^d do after the gospel they must first observe
and keep.ij. things / that is to sey mercy and justice. And also that they
know when they must be merciful and when they must use justice.

Then first (...) ^ehoueth that thine intent be to defend the ryghtuous and
innocent and so with the secu^er right to come in aid unto the right of the
gospel reproving and rebuking openly and without any favor all
vnryghtuousnesse to th^^te^t that the people may lyve freely under thy
protection preserved from theves (...). therars and from all manner oppression
and iniurye as far forth as it is possible unto the / when thou do so thou
art gods servaunt. But it behooves that thou be well ware in such things to
aduenge thy silf in thy judgment and that thou gyve no judgment nor sentence
but only where thou know that thy judgment is ryghtfull and that nether for
hatred endye nor favor. And yet thou must do it with as great mercy and
compassion and as tenderly as thou would cut of a corrupt member from thine
own body / which by the malice of his corruption if thou dydest let him alone
would corrupt thy hole body. It were also no hurt in this matter to keep the
ordinance sometime made by Theodosius Emperor which ordined that none should
be put to death before that he had been.xxx. days in prison to the intent that in
the mean time he might be well aduysed to make answer. And to the intent that
the judge should cause no man to dye hastyly and with out aduysement / but that
he might have time to ^ole his enchauffed courage.

And when any of the comynaltie should happen to do any evil by mysfortune
against right and justice the which has alweys before been of good life and
name / such a one may a judge help against the laws and procure his
delyuerau^ce without sin. For if it be so that the law of Moses had so great
distrecio^ that thereby they did not put them to death which unawarely and by
case of mysaduenture had committed murder against their will. (...)
As it is written in Deuterono. So that Mofes had assigned three citees unto the
which they that had committed homycyde by misfortune against their will
might fle for their safeguard. How much more should we which are christian
that lyve after the gospel and love our enemies have and keep discretion and
regard in this matter

This I say to the intent that the iuges shall not think that they offend if
they help such. For when they have hope and lyklyod that the evil doer shall
amend they (...). 8
must be alweys merciful. As christ was unto the woman which was found in
aduoutrye As saint John reherseth. The temporal law must obey and serve unto
the gospel: hit may in no wise be contrary thereunto wherefore if en^ thing
theryn ^e against the gospel then the te^porall law must gyve place and
perisshe in that point: For we must alweys obey more unto god then unto ^en: As
teaches us saint Petre. Them that we may amend by warnyng we shall not
correct them by justice. All that a judge may do without sin in the cause of
an other he may not do it in his own. For none may ad^^ge his own iniurye /
nor vex his christian brother for his own proufit: As it is before said that
the true christen never playneth unto the judge of the iniurye that men do unto
him but suffers all pacyently. As says saint Paul. 1. Cor.
Now is sin yet alweys in you because that ye have stryves to gyther among
you. whi do ye not rather suffer wrong? why do ye not rather receyve hurt.
It behooves the iuges to look dylyge^tly that the one do not wrong the other
without loki^g that every man should co^pleyne unto him and al by charity
seching nothing but the rest and quietness of their christian brother whom
the evil people do oppress. The prophet Esaie reproves the princes and
inges that in their iugementes and sentences take regard unto richesse /
seching their own proufit: or bering favor unto their friends / saying on
this wife: Thy princes be vnfeithfull / fellows of theves. They al love bribes
they follow rewards / they judge not unto the orphantes / and the cause of the
wydowe enters not unto them. They ought to determine the cause with good
aduysement and as shortly as were possible / and to exhort the parties to make
brotherly appoyntement the one with the other showing them by the gospel that
the christen ought not to have suit and process among them. They ought to be
verey sorry of the dissension of their christian brethren / and of the evil
governaunce of evil doers.

Hit behooves also that the lords enforce them silues to put a wey al evil
custumes and that they forbid streytly that no young strong parsones go on
beggyng. For thereof comyth great evil / but shall co^stiayne theyme to i^rne a
cra^^e. There is a place in the Civil law that forbids that no strong
parsones being in he^th shall beg their bread. And therefore I merveyle
gretely that the temporal lords keep not this l^we / seeing that it is good
and not contrary but agreeable unto the gospel which co^maunde^h that he that
labors not should not eat. The lords should procure and counceyle the
rich folk that they should do their dyligence to cause the pore young folk
to learn a crast to the intent that they should not go a begging and that they
have none occasion to take them to the w^let.

The ruelars should also ordeyne some honest provision that the poor impotent
/ young children / and old people that can not get their bread / and have not
whereof to lyve / should not be constreyned to go from door to door. But it were
^rather better that they should ordeyne three or four honest parsones in enery
parisshe which of a common treasure / as of the treasure of the poor / might
provide every weke as much as should be need to enery house of the poor. And
that by porcyon after the nombre of the poor. And that they should exhort the
rich to gyve their almefie to that common treasure and to bequeth that that
they would bequeth by their testamentes other weys to that common treasure. For
we can find the mean to build great abbayes for to nourisshe in delicate
lyving strong people that may labor and some t^me me hores and bawdes also
And why can we not as well find the mean to do our charytable works
according to the gospel to the poor impo^ent syke and feeble: we should also
by houses for the poor to dwell in as are the hospitalles situate in a fair
plesaunt and large out of the town. And likewise should we provide unto them
an honest man that might every day make unto them a sermon showing unto them
the word of god for to comfort them in their povertye / and languores:
which should be a service honest wholesome and verey acceptable unto God.

How that we must pay taxes and subsidies in aid unto our princes.
Chaptre.xxviij.
WHen saint Paole had converted the gentiles unto the christen faith: then
thought the Christen (seeing that now they had gotten god for their lord)
that they should be delivered from their erthly lords / and that it should be
no more needful unto the^ to honor their temporal lords nor to pay unto
them taxes or tailles. which opinion Saint Paul reproved writing unto the
Romans. To. 13
And albeit that God almighty has delivered you by his son Jesus Christ from
your sins and from the subjection of the devil / ye may not think that ye
be thereby delivered from ^he obedience and service of your princes and lords
of this world. For the ^ervice that ye do unto your princes is ^ot hurfull
unto your health. Hit can but ^nely hurt or greve your body and tem^orall goods
if percase ye did pay unto ^heym any taxes or subsidies / when they ^ad no
need to require it. For these thin^s ye shall not therefore murmr / nor judge
against the punissaunces / nether (...) rebel against them albeit that it so
we (...) that they were uerey tirauntes / to thin^ut that ye sterre them not
to more gret^^ anger / whereby they should take occa^on to do the more gretter
oppressyon and ^yefe unto the christen. For ye must al^^yes labor to give
good ensample vn^other by your patience for to draw your ^des after that manner
from their evil li^as they shall se and behold your holy and ^^fible
conversation.

And therefore to him that exeth you tax (...) ^subsidye ye shall give it him.
In all (...) things shall ye be obedient unto your ^des although they were
paynems / to ^ntent that by that means ye may dra^^ them unto the christen
faith.

This is thobedience that saint Paul^ speaks of in the said Chaptre. After
thi^ manner was our savior Christ obedyen unto the temporal puissaunce / and
pay^ the tribute money for him silf and for saint Peter. Mat.17.
Not that he owed it but bycaus^ he would gyve noman occasion to be offe^^ded.
This should all the christen considre^ keep them silves from murmuryng an^
grudging when subsidy or taxacion is a^^ed of them. But when they axe nough^
thou owe them naught before god. for as Christ was passed by them that axe^
tribute he proffered them none / for he owed them none / but when yt was axed
/ he paid it / as we have said before. And the lords ought to be well ware
that they oppress not their subjects / for thereof they shall yield a streyte
account before God.

Of men of war and of the war whether the Christen may war without sin
an informacyon after the Gospel. Chaptre.xxix.
THe men of war have nothing in the gospel for the gospel knows no me^ of
war nor the war but only peace. Albeit that many doctoures sey that the
men of war is a thing reasonable and good because of the words of saint John
baptist who as (writes saint Luke in the gospel) answered unto the men of
war ax^ing him whate thing they should do to be saved that they should hurt
noma^ but should be contented with their wages. By these words will the
doctors and / Theologyens say that the men of war may war pill and do
evil without sin. But they understand not the words of saint John.

ye must understand that the teching of saint John brought noman unto full
perfection. It did but only make ready the heart of man unto god and unto the
teaching o^ Jesus christ. He rebuked the most grettes^ euilles by his preaching.
He did but only teache the beginning of righteousness / a^ though he would
have seyed: If I should all ar^once forbid you to war / ye might not yet for
your wekenesse suffer it ^ nor ye^ might not leve^t all suddenly. But begin
first to ^eue the most grettest evil as to do hurt and outrage unto other / as
to burn / to kill / to pill and so forth. And be alweyes content with your
wages.

So was saint John Baptist none other thing but as a man that abateth and
cutteth of from a piece of timber the most gretest knotres. He does it not to
the intent that it should abide so. But when the knottes and wars be cut of
then comith a better master carpenter that planeth it and makes it more smothe
with a large fine rabot. Likewise did saint John by his preaching / he did but
only abate and cut of the great knottes / that is to sey / the great sins.
And yet they were not clean taken away and cut of till an other better master
workman came after and ^ut them of with his fine rabot. And therefore was he
nothing else but a voyte crying in the deserte which cried: Esa. 40
Make ready the wey of the lord: make ^^reyght his fete paths.

He was not the light as says saint John the Evaungelist. He could not
pardone our sins / for he was not Christ. John. 1


He was but only a voice a foregoar and a shewer which made ready the wey
against the coming of Christ.

And for this cause did Saint John send his disciples to Jesus Christ / when he
should die to the intent that they might learn the full perfection of him. For he
had but only made them ready for to come unto christ. for this cause and reason
it is al manifest that saint John has not preised the war by these words /
but has rather forboden it: As teaches all the gospel. for as it is a thing
evil agreing that the ho^de fight against the head / So is it a thing as evell
agreing and great sin that one Christen war against the other. To. 12
For we are all brethren and members of one body / the body is Christ /
which in all his life preached peace and concord to all them that he taught.

Saint John in his first epistle says: 1. Ioh. 4
He that hates his brother is an homicide We may hate noman / we must love
our enemies / we must pray for them and do good unto them that persecute us.
How can it then be possible after the gospel that we may war without sin?
wherein so many people lose their livis and whereby so many parsones come to
wildenesse riot and evil life. There be textes in the canon law that suffer
some wars. But the reehing of Christ forbids all wars.

It is a thing horrible and dangerous for body and soul to enterprise and
move a war. For all malice reyneth in time of war. Nevertheless when a
country is invaded or a town beseged and when the common peace is troubled /
and great violence is done unto the subjects: the lord of that country is
bound by brotherly love to help his subjects / and to defend them to
punysshe the evyll / and to put his life in ieoperdy for his subjects.

But he must alweyes beware that he do it not to revenge his own wrong / or
for to enlarge his land and lordship / but only to defend his subjects. And
so may he use the horrible business of the war / charitably and christenly.

But if it were possible to agree for gold or silver / he is bound to do it.
For the life of a chrilren is more worth then all the richesse of the world.

A lord shall think alweyes that there is a king above him in heve before who
me all parsones shall yield account at the last day of judgment ye of the lest
works and thoughts that he shall do / be he king or Emperor / (...) / nobill
or ignoble / young or old.

We read that the people of Israel did war many times but their wars were
1. Co. 10
but all figures / As says saint Paul. wherefore it betokens to us that we
shall likewise fight not the one against the other / but against our silves /
that is to sey / against our sins against pride wrath covitize / lechery /
hatred / envye and such other.

How servauntes should lyve a doctrine after the Gospel. Chaptre.xxx.
SErvauntes that serve their lords / mastres / ladies and mastresses / shall be
true unto them as unto them silves and shall alweyes do the proufit of their
lords and mastres as though it touched them silves / They shall nor do their
service only for temporal rewards. For thou may by the service that thou
do unto thy master please god as well as though thou were no servaunt and as
though thou were in the church ^prayng on thy knees.

Therefore thou shall do thy service by faith and love in god thus thinking in
thy silf. Behold dear lord God I thank the that thou have not made me rich /
I am well content with the state that I am in. I will with a good will for the
love of the serve all the world. And I thank the that thou have made me
worthy to suffereny thing for thy love / and that I may in this world be one
of the lest and le^t esteemed when thou serve^^ thy lord in such a faith with
a good will thou receivest not only the reward or wages of men / towhome thou
servest / bnt that more is of God.

Therefore thou shall do thy labor diligently and joyfully / not as though
thou did sarve a man / but as though thou did serve God / as truly thou
do.

For so does saint Paul teache the writing to the Ephesians where he says:
Ephe.
Servauntes obey unto your carnal mastres / with fear and trembling in
ynnocency of your hearts as unto Jesus christ / not with service in the yie
^ight as men pleasers / but as the servauntes of Christ doing the will of god
with all your hearts with good will / even as though ye served the lord and not
men.

Remember also that whatesoever good any man does / that shall he receyve ageyn
Col. 3
of the lord whether he be bond or fre, and ageyn unto the Colossians.
Servauntes (says he) obey unto your bodily mastres in all things / not with
yie service as me^ plesers / but in simplicite or ynnocency of heart fearing the
lord god. Do all that ye do with a good will / as though ye did it unto the
lord God / and not as unto men / knowing that ye shall receive of the lord the
reward of enherifaunce for ye vo serve the lord Christ. But he that does wrong
shall receyve for the wrong that he has done: for there is no respect of
parsones. 1. Pe. ^
And also saint Petre says in his first epistle. Servauntes be subject in all
fear unto your lords not only unto the good and courteys / but also though
they be froward. For it comith of grace if a man for conscience toward God
endure grief suffering wrongfully. For whate preyse is it if when ye be beten
for your fautes ye take it patiently? But and if when ye do well ye suffer
wrong and take it patiently / then are ye great thank worthy before god.
Therefore thou shall in all things have god alweyes before thine yies and not
the men whom thou servest outwardly. As did Paul the bisshoppe which put
hi^silf into the service of the lords for the son of a widow. And because
that he had given all his goods for the will of God. He gave also him silf
into service for the love of God / for to deliver the son of the wydowe.

Be not sorry that thy mastre both not suffer the to go to the church to here
mass For thou may please god as well in doing thy work by such a good
intent as though thou were in the church when thou belevest: but thou must do
thy labor in such a faith as is before said. God regards not whate thing
we do or in whate place we be: but of whate courage and in whate feith we do it.

The servauntes shall take good head that they anger not their maystre or
mastresse. And when it shall so happon that then incontinent they axe them
forgy venesse. He shall alweys honor his mastre bering his hasty words /
keeping him silfe that he do not rebel and answer spitefully unto his master.
Gen
For thou art bound to support him and to gyve place unto him As the angel
taught unto Agar the servaunt of Sara^ the which fled from her mastresse as it
is written in the.xvi. chaptre of Geneu^s where the angel came unto her and
said: Go and turn toward thy lady and humble thy silf under her hand So
should the servaunt humble him stife under his lord / and when he has angered
him / to appayse him ageyn with humble demeanure and obedience. So did Saint
Paul make agreement bitwixt Onesimus and Philemon from whom he was fled awey:
(...) Phile ^one^,


The lords and mastres shall use their servauntes as me^ / not as asses. They
shall entreat them lovingly and softly / and not as tirauntes / for they be
their christian brethren and members of one body (that is) of Jesus Christ
wherefore thou shall not overcharge them with things not convenient or
unreasonable: but thou shall use them as members of thine own body For Christ
is our head / and we all to gyther be his body / and every one of us by him
silf is a membre of his body be he man / or woman / lord or servaunt / rich or
pore: as writes saint Paul unto the Corinth^e^s For this cause as no man
hates his own Cor. 12
members / but keeps them a^ well as he can: So shall we love the one the
other / and shall serve by charity and socoure the one the other as one membre
socoureth an other. It was sometime the custume that all parsones did call the
one the other brethren and sisters. This did ^^appostles institute to the intent
that the hethen might know whate love there was among the Christen. we may
find many mastres now a days that use their servauntes like asses / not
like men / nor like their own members / whereof they shall yield unto god a
full streyte account. Ephe.
Saint Paul exhorts you to entrete your servauntes with all sweetness. Ye
masters (says he) show the same love and dilection unto your servauntes that
they show unto you / absteyning your silf from threteninges remembering that
their mastre and yours is in heven / And there is no respect of persons
before him. And unto the Colossians: ye masters do unto your servauntes that
which Col. 1
is just and egall remembering that ye have also a master in heven.
Nevertheless although the mastres be rigorous and hard yet I counceile (with
Saint Petre in his first epistle) all servauntes that they take all that their
masters and mastresses ley unto their charge patiently / and that for the love
of god / if it be not so that they command to do a thing that is against the
commandment of god / for in such a case they must rather obey god then men.
As says saint Pe^er in the acts of thappostles. Act.


Of the widows life a short informacion after the Gospel. Chaptre.xxxi.
THappostle saint Paul teaches us writi^g unto his disciple Timothe that the
widow shall use her liberty unto the honor of god and that she shall serve
willingly the pore wesshing their fete / and socouring them after her power.
And to the intent that she should have whereof to socoure the poor she shall not
run about ydell from house to house clatering / but shall get her expenses
in her own house by her labor. And she must keep her silfe from ydelnesse /
and from delicate eating and drinking for by such means they f^ll into evil
desires and foul sins. Such widows so living in carnal pleasure / lyving
be deed already / As saint Paul says in the seyde place. They lyve in a
dangerous estate / it were much better that such widows did marye ageyn
then so to lyve in idelnesse and pleasure.

But the widow so taking her pleasures desires not the everlasting life
because she has no travayle here / and this is the grettest blyndnesse that
any parsone may fall in to. And therefore it were much better that she were
married ageyn for the carfulness and rule of house keeping / and the obedience
that the married woman to under her husbonde dely vereth the parsone from evil
desires. and for this cause counceyleth sa^nt Paul that the young wydowes mary
ageyn.

Laud and honor be only unto God. AMEN.
FINIS.
