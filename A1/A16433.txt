Printed at London for Edward Aggas. 1585.

Alexander Prince of Parma and Playsance, Governor, Lieuetenant, and Captain
general, etc.
Dearly and well-beloved, The tediousness of this inward war and desolation
which this Country has sustained, have given you sufficiently to understand,
and as it were palpably to feel the small duty that you ow unto the causers of
the same, who in respect of their own passions and particular interest, have
procured the destruction of the poor people. It is not therefore necessary to
repeat unto you all such things as have passed since the beginning of these
troubles, since even the most ignorant have evidently perceived that the
stirrers up of these wars bent not their endeavor to the maintenance of
common commodity and quiet, but rather to whatsoever tended to the
perticularities of their dangerous devises. For in case we should begin to rip
up their dealings we should find first that the late of Orange sought no other
but a continual confusion of all things, and never cared for succoring any one
of those towns which my L. the Kings army besieged and conquered. The like may
we report of ye French, for your selves are to testify how they purposed to
entreat your wives and children in recompense of such and so many honors as
you strained your selves to heap upon them. Now that God has been served in
calling out of this world as well the one as ye other, and that thereby you do
on the one side find your forces decay, and on the other do perceive your Kings
great power together with such happy success as it pleases God the Creator
daily to grant unto him to increase, it were more then time for you to have
some respect to your own safeguard, and the discommodity of your pore people
oppressed and environed with so many mischiefs, whereunto in the end they shall
be forced to stoop. A Cause that being moved by private zeal which we bear
to the country, as well in respect of the place from whence we be descended,
as also of such courtesies as we there tasted in our youth, we have hertofore
by our letters endeavored to represent unto you, even as well to you
perticulerly, as also generallye to al other ye towns and provinces such
means as in God and our consciences, did unto us seem most expedient for the
restoring of the whole country to peace and quietness, but in as much as the
late of Orange and others (who sought only by the destruction of the country
and blood of so many innocents to intrude themselves into the gouernmente and
dominion of the same) did wickedly deteine and suppress our said letters, we
thought it good now for a final conclusion to write yet this one unto you,
wherein we desire you with all ferue^cy and zeal possible to take pity upon
your wives, children, and desolate country. Once again call to remembrance
and look back upon such rest and felicity as every man hertofore did enjoy
under the obedience of his Majesty, and contrariwise consider of the
destruction and extremity wherinto at this present your country is reduced,
which yet daily (if the war continue) will more and more increase, unto ye very
tipe and uttermost periode of the same. He^ceforth stop your ears against the
lying inventions and subtle persuasions of those which do maintain and feed you
with this error of mistrust of the goodness and sincerity of the king your
natural prince, which nevertheless is such that notwithstanding the injuries be
bitter and hard to digest, yet does he not stand upon the^, but offreth you
perfect and perpetual oblivion. Furthermore in case you be disposed, according
to the desire of more then half your Bnrgesie of Antuerpe (as by such
aduertisements as daily and hourly from all parts we do understand) to enter
communication and parlie, we do promise ye that for our parts we will in such
wise concur with you in whatsoever honestly and reasonablye you may
propound, that you shall effectually perceive that we be rather led by a
fatherly affection and unfeigned good will ye we bear to your private benefit
and tranquillity, then any other our own interest and particular passion, or
mistrust of the success of our enterprises. Whereas contrariwise if you do
purpose to be obstinate and stubborn, your selves will procure ye empayring of
all conditions of reconsiliatio^: furthermore protesting that our selves are
altogether blameless in the shedding of so much innocente blood, as also of
whatsoever calamities may hereafter ensue. To the end therefore that hereafter
no man pretend cause of ignorance of this our good will together with such
offers as we make unto you, we do write our Letters to the same effect, unto
the great Counsel called Den Breeden Raedt, and other the Fraternities:
beseeching the Creator so to touch the hearts of those that may do most among
you, that the wealth and quiet which you are hereby to hope for, may according
to our hope, shortly ensue. And so praiing the Lord to have you most dearly
and well-beloved in his holy and worthy protection, we cease. From our Camp at
Stabrocck this 13. of Nouemb 1584.

Signed Alexander, and somewhat lower, Garnier. The superscription, To our
dearly and well-beloved the Borrovvmaisters, Sherifes, and Counsel of the
town of Antuerpe.

The Aunsvvere.
MY Lord, your Highness Letters of the 13, of this Month, respectively written
unto the Magistrate, ye deanes of Fraternities, and the great Counsel of this
Town have been received and read, as well by our College, as by all the
members of our town in the great counsel of ye same expressly assembled to
that end: Whereunto of one consent we have resolved for answer to show to your
highness in all reverence, that the exhortation to us made that we should
consider of the intent of those that have been procurers of this inward war,
we have accepted in very good part as proceeding from your highness good
affection that you bear to these countries, which you do wish to be reduced
to some better quietness, as our selves do also heartily desire the same, and
in consideration thereof do most humbly thank you. But under your correction,
it seems that your highness are not sufficiently informed of the true
original and fountain of this war* for it is manifest to all the World that
against our wills, and to our great grief we were forced thereto by the
driftes and practices of those, who for their own private purposes, and to the
end to establish in these countries a dominion in effect more than roial, have
under pretense of religion, with their sinister informations procured at ye
Kings Majesty's hands (unto whom as also to all other the high and mighty
Princes his predecessors, these countries have evermore borne as faithful and
true obedience, as ever any other nation in the world did bear to their
Prince) generally against all the inhabitants of the country, of whatsoever
estate, condition, age, or kind, the erection of the most horrible and cruel
persecutions ye were ever herd of or practiced, together with infinite
confiscations of goods, proscriptions, banishments, and bloody executions, by
fire, sword and halter, against al sorts of pore, honest, and innocent people,
who even unheard in their just and lawful defense, have been without
imposition of any crime condemned, only for gathering together to pray and call
upon one God, through our only mediator Jesus Christ, according to his own
word and commandment: whereupon contrary to the treaties, agreements and
edictes, so firmelye made and published by the Lady of Parma, your Highness
mother, with the aduow and consent of the whole counsel of estate, yea even
in ye kings name, under his authority and seal, have ensued such tirannicall
executions by the late Duke of Alua, and the Spaniards, not against the pore
commons only, but also against the principal governors, Lords, Barons, and
Nobles of ye country, of whom his majesty had received most notable service:
ye manifest infringing of al rights customs and privileges, sworn unto by all
Princes of these countries: ye subversion of all seats of Justice, which have
been committed unto such men as by all ancient laws and privileges of the
country, were utterly incapable of ye same. The raising of diuersforts, and
intolerable, unjust, and unlawful exactions, together with the utter
oppression of all ye liberties of ye whole country. Which things being so
notoriously committed against al ordinary form of Justice, could not possibly
bring forth any other fruit then this miserable war which have overwhelmed us
in this floude of mischiefs and sea of calamities. We do therefore beseech
your highness to believe that we never entered into this war of any pleasure
neither by the motion or perswation of the late Lord the P. of Orange of famous
memory, who came not hither, but at the instant request of the estates, as well
of the Prelates, as of the Nobles and towns, neither usurped any other
authority then with great importunity was laid upon him. But that of mere
extremity, and inevitable necessity we were forced and constrained to take
Armoure, and to enter into these Conflictes, whereof we desire nothing in this
World, more earnestly, then some good end by a happy peace and general
tranquillity.

We do also most humblye thank your Highness for such Parley as at this
present you do offer us the fruition of, and can not sufficiently commend and
extol your magnanimity, who having more then any other Governor your
predecessors, made proof of your virtue and valiauncie in arms, do
nevertheless so courteously offer to accompany the same with all gentleness
and clemency: a virtue undoubtedly most commendable, even in the greatest
Princes and Monarks. So that having before time ben thus persuaded of your
highness, if we could have been certefied that you had sufficiently ben
authorized to have granted unto us whatsoever accerding to your wisdom and
discretion, you had known necessary for the establishing of a good and perfect
peace, we would never have so long delayed the committing of our selves into
your protection: neither would we have sought to enter into any other
communication and conditions then your Highness of your own discretion,
together with your clemency and courtesy. should have thought reasonable, as
nothing doubting but that willingly ye would have followed and moved the King
likewise to follow the path of the Noble and commendable examples of other the
great kings and princes his Predecessors, who in ye like disease having more
nearely searched out the root of the mischief, have found it impossible to
attain to the perfect cure thereof, and to the maintaining of their subjects
in a steadfast peace and firm quietness, accompanied with all faithful duty
and obedience to their superiors, without granting them liberty of their
religion, whereof at al times they offered to give account to any unsuspected or
not partial Judges, in all free assemblies and lawful synodes. For in this
respect have they found the especial and most sovereign remedy for all these
mischiefs to consist in moderate condiscending unto the just and lawful
request of their subjects, as appears by the examples of the most
victorious and mighty Emperors of famous memory Charles the v. Ferdinand and
Maximilian in Germany, also of ye most Christian kings in France, and the
kings of Polland, in their dominions. But when as by infinite testimonies, and
eue^ by sundry declarations which your highness have made unto us, we were
certainly advertised yt it lay not in you any way to dispose of yt point,
which nevertheless is the only ground and principal pillar whereupon this
peace or war does consist, yea and that the King finding himself subject to the
Spanishe Inquisition, and the Pope of Romes commandments, had neither authority
nor liberty to grant to his christian subjects the same which the Pope and
sundry Italian Princes do permit to the Jews and Turks, and without ye
which it is utterly impossible to turn from the people a continual course of
al sorts of calamities, we found our selves past al hope of attaining unto any
thing ye might breed our assured rest, the same necessity which forced us to
enter into these wars, did also constrain us to continue the same, thereby to
defend our selves from so intolerable and wicked oppression, so ye after
infinite most humble supplications, petitions, declarations and protestations
as well by writing as by our deputies sent into Spain, besides the manifold
intercessions and mediations of diverse christian kings and princes in vain
prosecuted for the space of 20 years or more, we were finally compelled to have
our recourse to foreign Princes: And at this present pondering the great and
singular wisdom, equity and moderation whereby the most christian King does
maintain his subjects as well of the one as the other religion in all rest and
tranquillity, and finding also our selves in such want and necessity, we
cannot disse^ble with your highness, but must needs give ye^ to understand ye all the united provinces which are confederat with us by a general and universal
resolution have already had recourse to the most christian Majesty, and most
humbly have besought him to take our cause in hand, and as his subjects to
receive us into his protection, to ye end to defend us from so extreme rigor
and cruelty: wherein he has given us so courteous audience and good hope that
according to the duty wherein solemnly and generally we all stand now bound
unto him, it is no longer in us to enter into any communication or Parlie ye
may never so little be prejudicial to our offer and promise, unless we would
willingly incur a just reproach of the greatest unsteadfastness and ingratitude in
the world. Moreover as we are but one member of the said generality, also ye
by solemn oath we have bound our selves not to enter into any parlie or
treaty of peace without the general consent and agreement of al others ye
united provinces, we cannot, though we would, accept your highness offer before
we have obtained the consent and good will as well of them, as of the said
most Christian Majesty. Hereupon do we therefore most humbly desire your
Highness; ye according to this your fatherly courtesy and clemency which so
freelye you offer unto us, it may please you not to mislike that before we
enter into any Parlie we do according to our duty, send your highness letters
unto ye said united provinces, and by their consent and agreement do likewise
exhibit the^ unto his said most christian Majesty, to the end ye since it has
pleased him to do us so much honor as to hearken to our most humble complaints
which in other place have been rejected, we do nothing without his leave and
tolleration, least we should give him just cause to cast us of as deceitful,
inconstant, and unthankful persons. As concerning the protestation which it
pleases your Highness to make toward the end of your letter, we do undoubtedly
believe that your self are not the cause of sheding so much innocent blood,
neither of such mischiefs as may ensue, for that the original of this war
proceeds from an other foundation. But withal we do most humbly pray you
to consider that for our parts we are not justly to be blamed, as being entered
only into defensive war, not tending to any other then the maintaining of our
selves, our wives and children in life and liberty of conscience and in the
free calling upon the name of God, through our only Savior and mediator Jesus
Christ, and that therefore for our parts we would willingly cease from al
shedding of blood, in case it might likewise please your highness in effect to
prosecute ye moderation and clemency which in letters it pleases you to show
unto us, by staying the same likewise on your side, to the end ye by the
verification of this beginning, we may judge of the assurance of the rest:
farther beseeching your highness to believe that we do both admire and love your
virtues, and withal our hearts do desire to yield unto you most humble
service in what soever our honor, Oath and conscience, (which we pray that we
may reserve to God only) may any way permit. Hereupon my L. most humbly kissing
your Highness hands, we beseech God to send unto you whatsoever may be most for
your health.

From Anwerpe this 23 of November. 1584. Of your Highness The most humble at
command. The Borrowmaisters, Sherifes, Treasurers, Receiver and counsel of
the Town of Antuerp, having imparted the same to others the members assembled
at Breeden Raedt, and the Fraternities of the same Town. By their decree and
signed, B. Berlecom. The Superscription, To his Highness.
