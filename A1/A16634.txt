A Proclamation, Published by the high and mighty Prince Elector, John
Sigismond, Marquess of Brandenburgh, the four and twentieth day of February,
Anno 1614.
We JOHN STGISMOND by the grace of GOD, Marquess of Brandenburgh,
Arch-Chamberlaine of the sacred Roman Empire, and Prince Elector, Duke in
Prussia, of Gulyke, Cle^e, Berg, Sretin, Pomern, of the Cass^bians and Wandals;
also in Slesia, of Crossen and Jogernedorff: Vicount of Nurnberg Prince of
Rugen, Earl of Mark and R^uensberg, Lord of Rauenstein. To our well-beloved and
trusty, the most reverend religious, high, well learned and devoted, all and
singular, general and special Superintendants Prelates, Overseers. Parish
Priests: And in general, To all Ministers of the Church under our Dominions,
of the Electorats and Marquessate of Brandenburg, on this and the other side of
the River of Oder, do send our greeting; And besides we do declare and let
them know, That godly and Religious Princes, Sovereigns, and Magistrates in
all Countries, and at all times have considered properly to belong to their
high places, offices, and charges to look unto subordinate causes, and to
endeavor themselves, That all the unneedful and frivolous contentions and
disputations in the Pulpits, and all calumniations and comminations may be
abolished, put down, and taken away out of the Church, but especially such as
stifle, and ouer-boldly do undertake the same, and contrary to all Christian
love and charity, arrogantly do either assume or presume authority, to
censure, tax, and pronounce for Heretics, yea and wholly to disallow and
condemn other churches within and without the Empire (over which they have not
any charge to command or censure) not only with unseemly sharp and bitter
words, but also with all kind of notable and malicious surnames and slanders,
whereby the common people is not only scandalized, and the Church prejudiced:
But the edisication thereof is also apparently hindered.

And to omit and leave all ancient examples and presidents of other Princes,
That have been careful and provident to take order for all such triuiall and
frivolous contentions and disputations in the Pulpits or else where, we find
a commendable Example, and Memorial of the late excellent prince Elector,
Augustus of Saxonia, in the year of our Lord God 1566. and of the Dukes also
of Brownswicke and Lunenburg, in the year of our Lord 1562. in the name of the
common and general churches of low Saxonia. Likewise the prince Elector
Christian the first of Saxonia, and duke Ioachim Frederick at Lignitz and
Brieg, in the year 1601, Princes of famous memory have left behind them this
most commendable Example to immitate them. And not only the aforesaid
Presidents have moved us heereunto, but also amongst others this is not the
least; That we have had conference with other Electors princes, and States,
(howbeit there are very many amongst them, that do profess D. Luthers
doctrine, yet we are agreed together) That in our countries and dominions also
should be taken such order and provision, that there might every way be used
and observed all discretion and moderation by the Clergy in the Pulpits, and
other public assemblies: For to shun and avoid all scandal; perturbation, or
rather an intrication of consciences, and prejudice to the Church. Therefore
every man may easily perceive and consider, what grief it has been unto us.
That now, a reasonable long time, there has, by some of you (for in general I
can not accuse you) and surely by such as are induced and entised thereunto,
not out of a special zeal toward the truth of GOD, but rather out of
ambition, arrogancy and pride, yet they could say and speak the least to it,
if it should come to a trial, or else, if they could but get a little gain by
it, they would turn quite papists, because that they seek rather to be
praised by men then God; been used without all shame and fear, so many
acclamations, condemnations, slanderings, thunderings, and reproachings, and at
many times little regarding whether they bring forth the truth or untruth or
whether it be fitting or not fitting in the pulpit, but only to discomfort
true Christians, and to make them grieve at it, when they in cooling their
stomachs do power out their gall and venime, and make the Jesuits and
Papists (our common and public enemies) rejoice at it and make a laughing
stock of us; besides this, they do here withal, but heap upon themselves,
and upon their Auditors, the anger and wrath of God. For the holy* Scripture
teaches us quite otherwise, not willing that they that are united, and agreed
with us in the true grounds of faith and religion, and constantly and
faithfully believe only to be saved by, and through GODS mercy and the most
precious merits of our only redeemer, Mediator and Savior Jesus Christ*
excluding and putting away all other Mediators and helpers, should either have
any private disturbance of conscience, or receive other wrongs by public
scandals and calumniations, nor such as do with us also plant forth Christ
his Gospel, and stiffely fight for the same, and for the Gospels sake, yet have
they sustained and suffered of the Pope and his followers (common enemies of our
true Religion) many innumerable persecutions, and do daily sustain and suffer
them still, yea they have very often with a special courage and magnanimity,
gladly spent their bloods for the Gospels sake, then why should they be
excluded and separated out and from the Christian Communion? Moreover, the
Scripture does very earnestly command us: That all matters in controversy and
in question should not be rebuked, reproved, and contradicted by frivolous
words, and slander, (which is the proper nature of the Devil) nor by
heare-saying, and false witnesses, nor in malicious and detestable manner, but
out of mere ground of the word of God. The Scripture commands moreover, that
it shall be done and performed with Christian love, and a meek spirit, with
friendship, patience, and with hearty compassion of those that be in error, and
not with contentious, slanderous, and injurious words to the undoing and
destruction of the erroneous. Therefore every one can judge by himself, how
far these thundering exclaimers, above mentioned, do destray from the right
way, and what insupportable judgment in the end shall come upon them that do
endeavor themselves to rule much more over the consciences of man, then to
further and increase the Church of God with good examples.

And forasmuch as it belongs unto us, as Sovereign of these countries* by
God appointed to follow and use our office according unto the first and the
second Table of the ten Commandments of God; and because we will not make our
selves partakers of such heavy sins: Therefore we do statute, ordain, and
command (howbeit many of you are already personally admonished thereof,
although little by you regarded,) That ye hereafter shall endeavor your selves
to preach and teach to the congregation and flock committed to your several
charges, the pure and clear word of GOD, out of the Scriptures, of the
Prophets, and Apostles, out of the four capital Symboles or Creedes, out of
the reformed confession of Augspurg and the Apology thereof, and without any
deprauation and falsifying of the Scriptures, as also without the formular
glosses of new Doctrine, which some lazy, curious, and proud Theologians have
devised and forged amongst themselves, to obtain therewith the primacie in the
Church and Secular power to themselves ye shall teach therefore and instruct
the people with the pure word of God: For you shall draw more souls to the
church of Christ, in seeking only the honor and glory of God, and the salvation
of the people. And to the contrary, you shall leave and shun all railing,
slandering, cursing, and banning other Churches that are not committed to your
charges, and which as yet never were convicted of any error by their due
confession. For we cannot for conscience sake, longer abide and be silent unto
the same, and therefore if we do hear and perceive, That one or more amongst
you (whosoever he or they be, none excepted) that shall hereafter
contemptuously transgress this our earnest and straight Edict, being
conformable to the word of God, they may certainly assure themselves, that
they shall be sent for forthwith to appear at the Court, and there in our
behalf to be heard, and our meaning propounded unto them. And if we then yet
cannot perceive amendment in them, that he or they shall be put out of their
place and office, and dismissed the same. Likewise they there shall be
proceeded against with due justice, and severity of the Law that being sent
for will not appear, that they may be brought to obedience: And we do admit
and grant, and it is not against our will and pleasure, that if there be any
zealous and curious among them that shall think their consciences to be too
straightly and narrowly charged with this our Christianlike and well-minded
Edict and Proclamation, that they may provide themselves otherwise with our
full and free liberty and consent, and depart out of our Dominions, and take
their residence in such places where such unchristian contentions, railings,
calumniations, slandering, cursing, and banning other Christians and their
co-members may be permitted and allowed unto them: For which they may expect,
in time, of God Almighty their reward. Moreover, we do statute, and our will
and pleasure is, That if any of our Clergy for obeying this our Edict and
command should be invaded by other peacehating people, and provoked and
entised to enter into dispute with them by preaching or writing. That they to
the contrary shall not commence nor begin any thing without our special
priuitie, consent and leave, much less to make any strife amongst them, but
rather shall be contented by the testimony and witness of his conscience, and
that he or they are innocent and unguilty to the actions and doings pretended
by other unquiet spirits. And we do not doubt, That as we have publicly
proclaimed and openly published unto all men this our Edict or Proclamation by
induction of the word of God, only to the end to procure, establish and
further the peace, quietness, unity, and edification of the Church in those
Countries which are by the Almighty GOD committed unto us in these last and
very dangerous days, wherein the Roman Antichrist thirsts more, then before,
after the blood of true Christians. That also every one amongst you will be
diligent, and endeavor themselves to maintain peace, and unity, to avoid all
scandalls, and to show their duetifull obedience, considering the command of
the Apostle Paul, whereby he does admonish and exhort every one to be obedient
to their Sovereigns and Magistrates, and that ye may know that they do not
bear the sword for nothing, and in vain, and that ye do not move us to
displeasure or indignation, or to use against you the straight and sharp course
of the Law. And hereby you shall fulfill our gracious, and likewise final
will, and good meaning, which toward you (upon sure confidence of duetifull
acknowledgement and obedience) we will be always willing and ready to make
manifest. In witness whereof we have commanded our Signet to be hereupon
imprinted. Dated at our Court at Colln upon the River of Sprew the 24. day of
the month of February 1614.
