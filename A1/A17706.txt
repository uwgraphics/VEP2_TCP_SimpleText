SERMONS of M. John Calvin upon the Epistle of Saint Paul to the Galathians.

Imprinted at London, by Lucas Harison and George Bishop. 1574.

TO THE RIGHT HONOrable Sir William Cecill knight, Baron of Burleygh, Lord high
Treasurer of England, Master of the Queens Majesty's Courts of Wards and
Liueries, Knight of the most noble order of the Garter, and one of her
highness most honorable privy Counsel, continuance of health, with
prosperity and increace of honor.
YOur Lordships great goodness diverse times shevved toward me, abiding
still fresh in my remembrance, to my no small comfort, calls upon me
continually to show some token of thankfulness for the same. For needs I
must confess that it has uttered it self many and sundry vvayes, and that,
(if I may with your Lordships good leave say as I think,) not without a
certain freendly or rather fatherly care of my vveldoing, specially in that
long continued suit of mine in the Exchecquer, where your just favor (I meene
in respect of the just case, and not of any desert of mine) procuring me
credit and help to the furtherance of my matter, has bin the very maintenance
and safety of my right, which else had bin trodden under foot by the over
mightiness of mine adversaries. And here it behooves me also too
acknovvledge, the upright administracion of Justice extended with favor in
that so intricate case, both by the Judges and Chauncelour, and by all other
the Queens majesty's officers of that Court. For after many heerings of the
matter with great patience and circumspection, and with shevving of such
records for both parts, as were known or thought to make for the
manifesting of the case: at length when the matter could not grovve too
speedy end by reason of certain difficulties and incidents falling thereinto:
about the first entrance of your honor into the office of high Treasurer, it
was by consent of the Court put in co^primise to such persons as both parties
are very well contented with. By means vvherof being discharged of my former
continual cares, travels, expenses and troubles, I had the freer liberty to
follow this mine accustomed exercize of translating, which me thought was
too me a singular benefit. And my rehersing of these things is not to
diminish the thank which I owe to your honor, by interlacing of other men's
doings: but to show to how many I am beholden through your goodness, and
that I am loath to be unmindful of my duty toward you or them, so far as
opportunity may well serve to witness the same. Now then, to the i^^ent I
might the better accomplish this my desire toward your honor, I bethought
me of the counsel of the wise Philosopher Seneca in his books of Benefiting,
the effect vvherof consists chiefly in these three points: namely, that the
thing which is done or bestovved too utter thankfulness vvithall, ought to be
very good, very durable, and very acceptable to the party that is to receive
it. That the two former points are in this work, which I (upon trust of
your Lordships former goodness and accustomed favor) do take upon me to
dedicate to your name, and that the third point also shall accompany it: the
reasons that persuade me are these. The things that of their own nature
tend only to the vvelfare and benefit of man, must of necessity be very
good: and of the things that are good, those are alvvaies best, which may
redound to the commodity of most persons, and which being once possessed,
cannot be taken away against the will of the possesser: Seeing then that the
foundation of this work is a parcel of holy scripture, and that (as says
S. Paul) all Scripture given by inspiratio^ of God is profitable to teach, 2.
Tim. 3. d*
to reprove, to amend, and to furnish men with righteousness, Romans 1. b.
that they may be perfect and forevvard to al good works: in so much that it
is the power of God tending to the vvelfare of all that believe, both Jews
and Gentyles: and therevvithall conteyneth promises not only of this present
life, but also of the life too come: it cannot but be of the self same nature,
property and operation that the rest of the scriptures are, because (as says
S. Peter) the scripture came not by the will of man, 2. Pet. 1. d.
but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the holy Ghost. And hereupon
springs another co^mendacion to the proof of the goodness of this work,
that the Author thereof is God the souerain goodness it self, and not man. To
be short, the same reasons may serve also to prove the durablenesse thereof.
Esa. 40. b.
For besides that God him self protests that his word shall endure for
ever, 1. Pet. 1. d.
and that the very heavens shall perish before any one jot of his sayings take
not effect: in as much as this book co^teyneth not vvorldly uncertain and
perishing, but heavenly, assured and everlasting benefits: nor things
auaylable to fevve, but profitable to all unless they themselves be to blame:
and moreover that God is the Author thereof: it must by all likelihood needs
continue with other of the same sort, at leastvvise among the godly, not for a
day or two, but so long as men shall have need to be edified and strengthened
in Christ. Which thing will appear yet more plainly, if besides these
generalities which it has common with all the residue of holy scripture, we
consider the work more peculiarly and nearly in it self, which consists of
two parts, too wit, of Text, and of exposition of the Text. The substance
of the text of this whole Epistle to the Galathians, is this: that when God
has once voutchsafed to inlighten men with the true knowledge of his
gospel, it behooves them to stand steadfast in the truth which they have
embraced, and to show by their godly conversation that they be the children of
light, so as they another turn back again as renegates or as swine to the
mire, nor be carried too and fro with every blast of doctrine like wavering
reeds, or like little children that are soon vveerie of the things that they
have, and fond of every new thing that they see. Hereoutof spring other more
particular points, concerning free justification by faith, concerning Christen
liberty, concerning the abolishing of Ceremonies, concerning the force and
effect of the law, and concerning the pure conversation of christian life. For
the order which the vvriters of holy Scripture observe well near in all
their Preachings and exhortations, is first to lay the foundation of faith in
our Lord Jesus Christ, and afterward to build up the works of charity and
true holiness of life, without the which, faith is not only naked, but also
dead. Thus much concerning the Text and the contents of the same. The
exposition whereof being uttered in Sermons by that learned and godly minister
of Christ Master Calvin (whose own doings tending alvvaies too the benefit
of Gods Church, may yield him far more credit than any commendacion of
mine can do) contains not any diverse or contrary matter, but the same
things laid forth in more ample and plain manner, applied to common capacity,
even of such as are of meanest understanding: by means whereof a greater
number may reap profit and commodity by them. In respect whereof they be
right necessary too be set before our eyes, and to be beaten intoo our minds
at all times, and chiefly in these days, wherein it is to be seen that many,
yea, and which is the more pity, too many, being after a sort ouerglutted
with the long continuance of the heavenly Manna, begin too loath the svveete
food of their souls, and to long again after the flesh pottes and garlike of
Egypt. In so much that some thinking it enough to be bare heerers or idle
professers and disputers of the Gospel, without yielding any fruit beseeming
their profession, verify the saying of the Prophet Esaias in honoring God with
their lips, vvheras their heart is far of from him, and shevve themselves to
be but sovvers unto corruption, as says S. Paul in this present Epistle.
Some not professing only, but also glorying in Papistrie, the sink of all
sin and wickedness, think themselves well apayd that they may be enemies
in heart and religion, too God and all godliness and godly men: And othersome
being as it were of no religion, and therefore imagining all things too be
lavvfull which they like of, are carried headlong intoo all manner of loocenesse
by their blind and unbridled affections, and like brute beasts could find
in their hearts that all cleanness of mind and body (without which,
noman shall ever see God) were so utterly abolished, as the very name of it
might never be herd of: whereas in the mean while those fevve whom the
fear of God and the desire of heavenly immortality draws too a more
heedefull vvarenesse of efchevving the things that may impeache Gods glory and
the free proceeding of his Gospel, or hinder and offend their neighbor, are
in the eyes of some persons not only despized but also blamed: verily as who
should say it were a fault too indeuer too be faultlesse. For as much
therefore as this work (like as all other of the same authors) tends to the
benefit of the Christen common weal, by putting us in remembrance of our
duty both to God and man, the continual minding and practizing vvherof is
the ground of all good order, and the very path way too perfect felicity: I
doubted not but it should be the better accepted of your honor, whose whole
care and travel is continually employed to the vvelfare of this Realm, through
the maintenance of sound Religion and the conservation of public
tranquillity, by the protection and appointment of our most gracious
sovereign Lady Queen Elizabeth, whom as God has made the Moother of his
Church among us, the comfort of all Christendom, and the very pillar, life,
and soul of our English common wealth: so I beseech him that we and our
posterity may long enjoy her blissed reign. To the furtherance of which
things I have here presently bestovved (and by Gods grace shall not cease
hereafter to bestow) my faithful travel, that the wavering sort may in
all goodness be confirmed, the vveaklings strengthened, the ignorant
instructed, the negligent warned* the forevvard incoraged, the slothful
pricked forth, the corrigible amended, and the vvilfull and stubborn sort
left utterly without excuce. And so praying too God ^or the long and
prosperous continuance of your good Lordship: and of all other noble
Counselors and men of Honor, by whom God aduaunceth the glory of his
Gospel among us: I refer this labor of mine with all humbleness too your
favorable acceptance.

Written at my lodging in the forestreete without Cripplegate the. 14. of
November. 1574. Your honors most humble always too command, Arthur Golding.

The Argument of Saint Paul's Epistle to the Galathians:
IT is well enough known in what part of the lesser Asia the Galathians dwelt,
and how far their Country reached, but as concerning their original, and
the place from whence they came first, the ancient Authors are not all of one
mind. They all agree that they were Galls, yea and thereof they bare their
name: for they were called Galgreekes, of a word compounded of Gal and Greek*
But the thing that hangs in doubt, is out of which quarter of Galland they
came. The Geographer Strabo thinks that those Galls which were called
Tectosages, came out of the Country of Province, and othersome say they came
out of Gall Celtike, which is the commoner opinion* Howbeeit for as much as
Pliny makes the people of Amiens to be next neighbors to the Tectosages: and
all Authors wel-neare agreee that the Tolistobogians were their companions
which dwelled about the Rhyne: I take it to be most likely that they were of
Gall Belgike which is the lowest Country upon the river of Rhyne toward the
English Sea. For the Tolistobogians hilde the Country that is now called
Cleuelande and Brabant. The common errrour (in mine opinion) grew upon this,
that a company of the Tectosages being cast upon the Country of Province,
took possession of it, and reteyning still their old name, conveyed over the
same to the Country which they had conquered. And that is the thing which
Ausonius the Poet of Bordeaux meeneth when he says, unto the Tectosages,
which were first named Belgians. For he called them Belgians, and does us to
understand that they were erst named ^^^tosages in sted of Tectosages.
VVheras Caesar places them in the black Forest, which in those days was
called Hercinia, or Hertswald: I believe it happened by shifting of places,
because they were retired thither out of their own Country: which thing may
be gathered by Caesar's own saying, where he makes mention of them. But we
have spoken enough of their original for this time. Pliny reports of the
Galathians which dwelt in that part of Asia, which was called after their name,
that like as they were divided into three principal peoples, that is too
wit, the Tectosages, Tolistobogians, and Tro^mannes: so also they had three
head Cities. Now for as much as they were there among neighbors of small
prowess, and nothing well trained too the wars: they spedde their business
so well in times past, that the greater part of the lesser Asia became
tributarie too them. But in the end they grew out of kind, and by little and
little lost their courage, giving themselves over to pleasures and wantonness.
By means whereof Cneus Manlius the Roman Consul vanquished them in battle
without any great adoo, and subdued them too the Empire, under the which they
were in the time of Saint Paul. Now although he had taught them the Gospel
faithfully: yet crept there in false Apostles in his absence, which corrupted
his good seed by their false and wicked doctrine: for they taught that the
keeping of Ceremonies was still necessary. It might have seemed at the first
blushe too have been a matter of no great importance: but Saint Paul
debateth of it here as of the chief article of the Christen faith. And good
reason, for it is no small mischief, when the light of the Gospel is
quenched, when men's consciences are clogged, and when all difference is taken
away between the old and new Testament. Furthermore, he saw there was a
wicked and mischeeuous opinion interlaced with those errors: which was, that
men may deserve or earne righteousness: and that is the cause why he
contendeth with so great vehemency and force. Wherefore seeing we be warned
what will follow upon the matter that is treated of here: let us read it
with diligence. If a man should judge the case by the Commentaries of Saint
Jerome and Origin: he would marvel why Saint Paul was so whote for any
outward Ceremonies. But if a man look too the welspring, he shall find that
the things were well worthy too be handled so sharply. And for as much as
the Galathians suffered themselves too be turned out of the right way through
ouergreat simplicity or light belief, or rather through inconstancy and
fondness: therefore does he rebuke them the more sharply. For I am not of
their mind which think that Saint Paul's rough handling of them, was because
they were naturally dull witted, and hard of understanding. The Ephesians and
Collossians had been tempted as well as they. Now if they had lightly given
place too the trumperie of the false Teachers, as the Galathians did, think
we that Saint Paul would have spared them? Then was it not the peoples
nature that made him so bold as too be in thatchafe with them, but rather the
vnwoothinesse of the matter compelled him too do so* Now that we understand
the cause why this Epistle was written, let us come too the order and manner of
proceeding which he keeps in it.

In the two first Chapters, he indeuereth to mainteyne the authority of his
Apostleshippe, saving that toward the end of the second Chapter, he
enters by occasion intoo the chief point, that is too wit intoo the
question of Justification, howbeeit that the peculiar place where he handeleth
that matter of set purpose too the full, is the third Chapter. And although
that in those two Chapters, he seem too treat of many things, yet his drift
is but too prove himself equal with the greatest Apostles, and that there is
not any default in his own person why he should not be taken for an
Apostle, and be as highly esteemed as the rest. Nevertheless it is good too
understand too what purpose he labors so much too mainteyne his own
reputation. For what matter makes it whither he be greater or lesser than
Peter, or whither there be no odds at all betwixt them: provided that Jesus
Christ reign, and that his doctrine abide pure and uncorrupted? Seeing that
all other must be diminished too the end that only Jesus Christ may grow:
it is in vain to strive (...) the prerogatives of men. Furthermore it may also
be demanded, why he compares himself with the rest of the Apostles? For
what odds was there betwixt Petr, James, and John? What needed it then to
set one against another after that manner, where there was so good unity and
agreement? I answer, that the false Apostles which had abused the Galathians,
had shrouded themselves under the names of the Apostles, as though they had bin
of their sending, to the intent to be the better welcome, and to work their
matters the easlyer. It was a trim way too wind themselves in, and too
purchase authority, to make them believe that they represented the Apostles,
and that the Apostles spoke as you would say, by their mouth. And in so doing
they defaced the name, power and authority of the Apostle Saint Paul. For
they alleged that he had not bin chosen by our Lord for one of the twelve,
nor bin acknowledged for such a one by the rest of the Apostles, and that he
had not received his doctrine, not only not of Jesus Christ himself, but also
not of any of his Apostles. By this means not only Saint Paul's authority
was diminished, but also he himself esteemed much inferior to them, as one
that was no better than one of the common sort. If the matter had touched no
more but their persons: it had bin al one with Saint Paul to have bin counted
among the least disciples. But seeing that the doctrine was by that means
discredited: he ought not to hold his peace, but rather to cry out against it.
L^ what the wiliness of Satan is: when he dares not assail the doctrine
openly, he labors too deface the Majesty of it by overthwart ways.
Therefore let us remember that the truth of the Gospel was assailed in Saint
Paul's person. For if he had suffered himself to have bin bereft of the
honor of Apostleship, it had followed that he had thitherto taken more upon
him than became him: and so, that false bragging of his should also have made
him to be suspected in all other things. Again, upon that very point
depended the authority of his doctrine, for so much as it had not bin received
as a thing proceeding from an Apostle of our Lord Jesus Christ, but as from
some common disciple. On the otherside it had bin darkened and defaced by the
brightness of the names of great persons. For the false Apostles glorying of
the tytles of Peter, James, and John, took Apostolical authority too
themselves also. Now^ if Saint Paul had not withstoode such boasting earnestly
and ^t^^utly: it had bin a yielding unto untruth, and a suffering of Gods truth
to be oppressed in his person. Therefore he stryueth in good earnest to
show both the one and the other: that is too wit, that the Lord had
ordained him to be an Apostle, and also that he was not inferior to any of the
others, but had the like dignity and authority that the rest had, according
to the name which he bare as well as they* He might well have denied that those
Gallants were sent of Peter and his fellows, or that they had any charge or
commission from them. But this defense is of far greater weight, when he
says that he him self is of as great authority as the very Apostles. For
if he had spoken any lowlier, it would have seemed that he had not bin well
assured of his case. Jerusalem was at that time* the moother of all Churches,
because the Gospel flowed from thence intoo all the world, and it was as the
chief seat of Christ's kingdom. All they that came from thence too other
Churches, were honorably received, and good reason. Howbeeit there were a
number which were puffed up with pride because they had been familiar with the
Apostles, or at leastwise had been trained up in their school: and therefore
they could away with nothing which they had not seen at Jerusalem. All other
manner of dealings which had not bin used there, they not only rejected, but
also boldly condemned. Such waywardness and pe^uishnesse is a dangerous
plague, when we will needs have the custom of any one Church too be
received for an universal Law. And that proceeds of an unadvised zele, when
we be so affectioned to some master or place, that without any judgment we
will bind all men to that one man's mind, or all places too the ordinances of
that only on^^place, as to a common rule. Soothly there is always ambition
mingled* with that manner of dealing, or to speak more rightly, such over
great waywardness is always full of vainglorie. But too return too these
false Apostles, if their foolish fondness had led them no further than only
to assay too bring in the use of the Ceremonies every where, which they had
seen kept at Jerusalem: they had done ill enough already: For there was no
reason why they should of a custom make by and by a common rule. But there was
yet a further mischief: namely their wicked and harmefull doctrine, whereby
they meant too bind men's consciences, and to ground righteousness in the
keeping of Ceremonies. Now we understand why S. Paul speaks so earnestly
in defense of his Apostleship, and wherefore he sets himself against the
other Apostles.

He pursues that matter till toward the latter end of the second chapter,
where he opens a gap to treat of his peculiar matter: that is to wit, that
we be justified freely before God, and not by the works of the Law. For the
reason whereupon he groundeth himself, is this: If the Ceremonies be not able
too justify a man, then is not the keeping of them necessary. Howbeeit, he
treats not only of Ceremonies, but of works in general: for otherwise it
were but a very cold discourse. If any man think that this is a drawing
aloof from the matter: Let him consider two things. First that the question
could not otherwise be resolved than by taking that general principle, that
we be justified freely by the only grace of God: which principle excludes not
only Ceremonies, but also all other works. And secondly that S. Paul stood
not so much upon the Ceremonies themselves, as upon the wicked opinion that
followed them: that is too wit, of purchacing salvation by works. Therefore
let us mark that the holy Apostle deals not impertine^tly, in beginning his
matter so far off, but that it stood him on hand too touch the welspring of
the whole matter, to the end that the readers might understand, that the thing
which he deals with here is no trifle, but of most importance above all
others: too wit, by what mean we obtain salvation. They then do mistake
their mark, which imagine that the Apostle stands upon the particular point
of Ceremonies: for that could not be well dealt with alone by it self. We have
a like example in the fifth of the Acts. There fell a contention and debate
about Ceremonies, too wit, whither* they were needful to be kept or no. For
the resolving of this question, the Apostles set down the vntolerablenesse of
the yoke of the Law, and the free forgiving of sins. To what purpose do
they that? For it seems too be an impertinent digression, and that they leap
out of the propounded matter without reason. But it is not so: For the
particular error could not be lively disproued, but by taking a general
proposition. As for example: if it behooved me too reason in defense of the
eating of flesh: I should not only make mention of meats, but I should also
arm my self with the general doctrine, and show whither men's traditions
ought to bind men's consciences: and by and by I would take this ground. That
there is but one Lawegiuer which has power too save and too destroy. To be
short S. Paul conueyeth his argument here from the general to the particular
negatiuely, which is a very ordinary manner of reasoning, and most agreeable to
nature that can be. Furthermore if we go to the body of the Epistle, woe
shall see by what textes and reasons he proves this sentence, that we be
justified by the only grace of Christ. This matter he handles too the end of
the third Chapter.

In the beginning of the fourth, he treats of the right use of Ceremonies,
and wherefore they were ordained: and there he shows also that they be
abolished. For it behooved him too prevent this absurdity which would have run
by and by in every man's head, To what purpose then were the Ceremonies
ordained? Were they utterly needelesse? did the fathers lose their labor in
keeping them? He dispatcheth both the one and the other in few words,
saying that they were not superfluous in their time, but that they be now
abolished by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, because he is the very truth
and end of them. And therefore he shows that we must rest upon him. Also in
that place he shows wherein our state differs from the state of the
fathers. Whereupon it follows that the doctrine of the false Apostles is
lewd and dangerous, because it darkeneth the brightness of the Gospel with
the old for worn shadows. He intermedleth certain exhortations with his
doctrine, too move men's affections: and toward the end of the Chapter he
beautifieth his discourse with a goodly Allegory.

In the fifth Chapter he exhorts them too keep the freedom purchaced by the
blood of Jesus Christ, too the end they should not yield their consciences in
bondage too men's traditions: Nevertheless he therewithal admonishes them
also wherein that freedom consists, and which is the true and right use of
it. And too the same end he shows which be the true exercises of
christenfolke, too the intent they should not lose their time in musing upon
Ceremonies, and in the mean while leave the chief things undone.

The first Sermon upon the first Chapter.
Paul an Apostle, not from men, nor by men, but by Jesus Christ, and by God
the father, which has raised him from the dead,

2. And all the brethern that are with me, to the Churches of Galatia:

3. Grace be with you and peace from God the father, and [from] our Lord
Jesus Christ,

4. Who gave himself for our sins, to deliver us from this evil world,
according to the will of God our father.

5. To whom be glory for evermore, Amen.


NOT WITHOUT cause does S. Peter so earnestly warn us to watch against our
enemy who goes about like a roaring Lion, 1. Pet. 5. c. 8.
with his mouth always open to swallow up the pray that the fyndeth. For
although that on the one side our Lord Jesus Christ assure us, John. 17. c. 12.
that God his father has given him the charge of us, and that the thing which
he has in his keeping shall never perish: yet does it not follow that we
should therefore fall asleep, and in the mean while have no care to call upon
God, considering the need that we have to do so. For faith does in such wise
assure us of Gods goodness, and that the same shall never fail us, that yet
nevertheless we must have an eye to our own frayltie, and thereby be stirred
up too pray God to give us invincible constancy. 1. John. 5. a. 4.
It is said, that faith shall always get the upper hand of the whole world: but
yet it follows not that we shall not have battle. Now, on our own side we
have no strength at all: but we must be feign to borowe it elsewhere: and that
we may so do, it stands us in hand to pray unto God. For as I have said
already, it lies us upon to be stirred thereunto, by reason of the great
need that we have of it. And therefore here is a myrrour offered unto all the
faithful, whereby we may fare much the better, if we can put it too our
use. For Saint Paul had preached through all the country of Galatia, which is
a meetly large country, and there had reered many Churches. If ever man were
filled with all the gifts of Gods spirit too win men too the Gospel: we
be sure that S. Paul excelled all others, or at leastwise all that were of
his company. And it is certain that he discharged his duty. Yet
notwithstanding he had scarcely so soon turned his back, but by and by Satan
gave a push to overthrow all, and too make a horrible havoc in the whole
country: and he won so great a multitude there, that the Gospel was as
good as quite abolished, even among those that had bin taught so faithfully.
Since we see such an example, ought we not too cast down our eyes, and too
consider that God warns us too flee unto him, and to pray him so too
strengthen us, as we may hold out too the end? Which thing we cannot do,
except we be vphilde by him. Ye see then that the faults which Saint Paul
bewrays here in the people of Galatia, must serve for our learning. For it
is all one as if God should in their person show what our constancy would
be, if he gave us it not.

Although then that we have bin faithfully instructed in the Gospel: yet must
God be feign too work from day too day, or else we shall be so fickle
minded, that we shall be carried away by and by, and for every little
occasion. Furthermore (as I have fayde already) Satan is a dreadful enemy.
And therefore it is not for us too be negligent, seeing he lies always in
wait for us, seeking on all sides to invade us, and that if he spy never so
little a hole, by and by he takes his advantage too enter: It shall not seem
that there is any gappe open for him, and yet we may be taken tardie before
we be aware. Wherefore let us mark well the warning that God gives us in
this text, and let us make our advantage of it. And on the other side we see
how the Devil has at all times served his own turn with the name of God,
and made thereof a false cloak too disguize the truth, and too turn it into a
lie, or else too sow some discord, that by little and little the Gospel
might quite fade away. The Apostles (as they that were chosen by our Lord
Jesus Christ too bear abroad his Gospel, and to preach it through the whole
world) were well worthy too have bin reverenced every where, and to have
bin of such renown and authority, as the things that proceeded from them
should have bin [throughly] received. For their calling was lawful: it was
[well] known that they did not thrust in themselves of their own heads, but
that the son of God had chosen and appointed them by his own mouth, yea and
made them as it were new creatures: being silly souls and ignorant folk,
they were so changed, as it appeared well that their doctrine came altogether
of heavenly miracle. For they had not learned ought but in Gods schole: and he
had in one instant of time so endued them with his grace and power, that they
became as instruments of the holy Ghost. Yet notwithstanding, the Devil missed
not too abuse their name and title, too bring store of troubles and stumbling
blocks into the Church* For such as went in their company, made their brags
when they came in far countries, that they had bin familiarly conversant with
them: and yet for all that, some of them were full of vainglorie and pride, and
sought nothing but their own advancement. Othersome were selfwilled, and could
away with nothing but that which they had seen in the City of Jerusalem, and
in the land of Iewrie: and they would have had the whole world subject to their
Iure, and therwithal would have turned al things vpside down as they say.
Others were led yet with a more wicked mind, so as they sought nothing else
but to overthrow all that S. Paul had builded. And all these (as I said before)
boasted that they had not learned any thing of him, but that they had bin
taught their doctrine by the Apostles themselves. Thus ye see how Satan has
always defaced Gods glory, even under the shadow of the gracious gifts which
he had bestowed upon his creatures. And in good sooth, we see how that under
the names of the Apostles, and of the virgin Marie, the Idolatry is the same
at this day in the Popedom, which it was among the Painims under the names of
their falls gods: for there is nothing changed, but only the names of the^. As
for the superstition, it is as filthy and detestable in the Popedom, as ever
it was among the Heathen.

Here therefore we be warned to be wise, to the intent that if the Devil
abuse Gods name, we may be able to resist him, and to discern what
authority men ought to have, and therewithal not to be ouerhastie of belief,
nor over easy to be moved and shaken with every wind. For if we have not
the constancy to walk in the doctrine that has bin delivered to us, when we
be once fully resolved that it is Gods pure truth: it will happen to us as it
did too the people of Galatia. Ye see then that the thing which we have too
bear in mind, is in effect, that when God has given us the grace too
understand his word, we must always go forward in it, and not be shaken
like Reeds, nor carried too and fro, nor led up and down like little babes:
but we must have the wit and discretion, to stick to the thing which we
know too be offered us of God. Mark that for one point. But by the way,
forasmuch as we cannot have such power in our selves: let us pray with all
lowliness and earnestness unto God, too reform us by his holy spirit, and
too give us such steadfastness as we may never swerve aside, and that when we
see all things turned vpside down in this world, yet notwithstanding, this
foundation may abide sure, namely that for so much as God which cannot lie has
spoken to us, and showed us his will: we may safely stand thereupon without
turning any way from it. Howbeit for so much as the Devil has many cunning
knacks too thrust us out of the way, yea and that (as I have erst said) he
will not stick to abuse Gods name to wind himself in, and to get some
access to us: it behooves us to understand that our reuerencing of men must be
in such wise, as God may in the mean season continue vnimpeached, and that our
Lord may have the whole maystrie over us to himself, as he that is the
teacher of the Church: and that our faith depend not, neither upon men's
knowledge, nor upon any reputation that we have of their wisdom, power, or
holiness: but that our Lord Jesus may always have the preeminence for us to
rest and settle our selves upon. For if our faith be not grounded upon Gods
pure truth, which is vnvariable: certainly it will be but a loasing. This is
the thing that we have too gather of the example that is set down here
concerning the Galathians. But by the way a man might think it strange, why
Saint Paul should deal so roughly with them as we shall see hereafter,
considering that the case stood not upon the open denying of God and the
renouncing of the Gospel, nor upon the blaspheming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
or the setting forth of any notorious idolatry: but upon the ceremonies of the
Law. For they against whom saint Paul strives in this Epistle, maintained
none other thing, but that the ceremonies of Moses law were to be kept, and
that men were bound to them under pain of deadly sin. Now, at the first
blushe it might be said that their case was favorable in that behalf. For the
case stood not with them as it does with the Pope, who during his tyranny
has forged many laws, and commanded this and that, bringing poor souls into
bondage: but their saying was, that inasmuche as the law was not of men, but
of God: therefore it was to be kept. Hereby it should seem, that S. Paul had
no cause to be so moved against that opinion, although it were not altogether
sound and good. Again, there is yet an other reason: namely that we must not
make so much a do about outward things, as whether one day is to be observed
more than an other, or whether Swines flesh be not to be eaten as well as
mutton. For whether a man observe any ceremonies, or whether he observe none,
as for example, If he forbear the eating of Swines flesh, or do any other like
thing: is his so doing an utter forsaking of christianity? No Yet
notwithstanding, that is all the quarrel that S. Paul has: yea and thereupon
he cries out, that the Galathians are backsliders, that they have forsaken our
Lord Jesus Christ, and that they are become renegates. Some man would say, he
uses ouermuche vehemency: but herein we be still warned, that the devil
will now and then find small trifles to draw us from the Gospel ere we be
aware, and therefore it behooves us to be so much the better advised: for of
our selves we shall not be so, but must in very deed be feign to be governed
by God. Esaias. 11. a. 2
And not without cause also is the spirit of wisdom fathered upon him, to the
intent we should seek it in him. Therefore let us resort thither: and if any
man go about to bring in a thing that seems not to be of any great
importance, let us bethynke us what a tail it might draw after it. And for
proof hereof, when we be once turned from the simplicity of the Gospel,
we shall become like whooremongers: according as we have seen in the last
Epistle, how Saint Paul says expressly, 2. Ca. 11. a. 3
that the Devil uses Bawdes tricks and Ruffian tricks, when he comes too
turn us from the doctrine of the Gospel. He will always make some goodly
and fair protestation, like as when a Ruffian intends to deceive a young wife
or a maid, he will not use any lewd terms or knauerie, for he knows that
she would abhor them: but he will mark by little and little how he may
infect her with his deadly poison. Even so plays the Devil in that behalf.
For if he should show his horns (as they say) at the first dash, and show
himself openly too be Gods enemy: every man would shun him, and we would
abhor him. But he windeth himself slily in, and creeps in at small
cranies, so as we shall wonder that he could prevail with us in sundry
things, and we shall still bear our selves in hand, that we cease not to
hold with Jesus Christ and his Church. And yet for all that we shall be
turned away, and in the end we shall perceive our selves too be quite cut
off. Therefore when we read this example, that the Devil had marred and
corrupted the Churches whereof mention is made here, [and that,] under the
shadow of the Ceremonies of Moses law: let us bethink our selves the
better, and stand stiffely without turning aside by any means from the
simplicity of the Gospel. Furthermore seeing he has stryued and disputed
about the Ceremonies of the law: let us look well about us too profit our
selves by all that is here contained, and let us stand continually upon our
guard, that we may find out the crafts and wyles of Satan. And whenever
he shall go about too undermine us, let us look well too our business, and
stand always too that which we have learned, so as we may be out of all
doubt, that we shall not find any thing in the doctrine of the Gospel, which
is not the pure word of God. For (as I said) that is the thing whereupon our
faith must be grounded. And if any man will add never so little too it, let
us not only suspect it, but also abhor it: for when there is such a mingle
mangle made with Gods pure truth, it can be nothing else but corruption. Now
let us come to the order which Saint Paul keeps in handling the doctrine
which we shall see point by point. That he may be the better heard and also
received, he confirms his own authority, which some men had gone about too
impeache. For behold, the policy of those dogs that incountered against
him, was too allege that the Apostles taught otherwise than he did. Now
forasmuch as Saint Paul had not bin conversant with our Lord Jesus Christ
while he lived in this world: it was supposed at the first, that the Apostles
were a degree above him, and ought to be preferred before him. And on the other
side they inquired who had put him in that place, as though he had thrust
himself in, and had done it rather of rashness than otherwise. Saint Paul
therefore was feign too set himself against all this geere, and too show that
he was truly sent of God. Furthermore (as I said erst) the Devil stirred
up others, who coming from Jerusalem, said that that was the mother Church,
and the holiness of all Christendom: and they pretended too be zeelous
setters forth of the pureness of the Gospel. By reason whereof, it behooved
Saint Paul too go forward in showing that he had not advanced himself, nor
taken any thing upon him of his own head, but had obeyed the calling of God,
and of our Lord Jesus Christ, who had made him his Apostle. Yea and he
compares himself with John and James and Peter, Gal. 2. d. 9.
who were (as men termed them) the pillars of the Church, and so taken to be
among all men, showing that he was no whitte inferior to them. And why [doth
he so] To the end his doctrine might be received: for that is the mark that
he amed at. Afterward when he has prepared the Galathians too receive
obediently the warnings that he gives them: the^ he debateth the matter which
was at that time in controversy, and shows that the Gospel is beaten down,
if we have not the freedom which is purchased for us by the blood of our Lord
Jesus Christ: which is, that the ceremonies of the law should not hold us any
more in subjection or awe. For (as we shall see hereafter) if such subjection
should be admitted, all the fruit of our redemption and of the salvation which
is purchased for us by the son of God, should go to wreck.

But now let us come to the order that S. Paul keeps for the mayntenance of
his authority. He says, that he is an Apostle, not on men's behalf, nor by
man, but by Jesus Christ, and by God the father, which has raised him from
the dead. First of all, we have to mark here, that Saint Paul, to the
intent too be received, groundeth himself upon the ordinance and
appointment of God. For surely no man ought to take upon him any honor in
the Church, Heb. 5. a. 4.
save he that is called, as I have declared already. Besides that, our faith
should be very feeble, if it should be settled upon men, how great
excellency or worthiness soever were in them: yea though they were perfecter
than Angels, yet were that nothing: our faith is so precious a jewel, as it
must rest altoogether upon God and his truth. Seeing it is so, if a man intend
to be heard, it must not be alleged, that he is witty and skillful, or that
he has seen and heard much, and is a man of great experience: al those
things are but smoke, when it comes too the leadyng of us too the kingdom
of Heaven. For there the matter stands not upon profounde wit, and high and
exquisite knowledge: all those things are but the sleyghts of Satan: Again,
we know how it is fayde generally of all man's wisdom, 1. Co. 1. c. 20
that it is but stark folly, yea and that God laugheth it to scorn, and
abhors it, because it turns us away from the obeying of him. Therefore
whenever the case concerns the teaching of us, all things that beelong too
man, or too any creature, must be laid a water, that there may be a well
ordered gouernemente in the Church, and such a one as God allows. For if men
advance themselves in that case, God is thereby plucked back, and in the end
there will be nothing but utter confusion.

So much the more then behooves it us too mark well what S. Paul shows us
here, in that he does not allege or bring any thing of his own for the
stablishyng of his authority, but holds himself wholly too Gods calling.
Mark that for one point. And herewithall we have too note, that Saint Paul
boasted not him self at all adventures, as many harebraynes do. For they
could find in their hearts to preach with full mouth, that God has sent
them, when as notwithstanding they be but fantastical fellows, and Satan's
very Champion, serving to overthrow all. But by the way, S. Paul in
protesting his calling, mente also to show by whom [he was called,] as we
have seen here before. And it was sufficiently known, that he had been
converted by miracle to the Gospel, that he had bin taught upon the sudden,
that God had by his means wrought after a strange and unaccustomed fashion,
and not only that it had bin openly reveled unto two or three men in the City
of Antioche that S. Paul was appointed too be the Apostle of the Gentiles, but
also that he had good warrant of it in all places where he came, because God
uttered his power most manifestly in him. So then when as S. Paul told them
that he was an Apostle, he presupposed that it was already sufficiently
justified, that God was the author of that office of his, and that the thing
which he pretended, was not a false surmize, after the manner of men, whom we
see too much subject too vaunting of themselves. Therefore we must put a
difference between S. Paul, and all such as falsely boaste and brag themselves
too be sent of God, as the Pope does, who too beguile the wretched world, and
to maintain himself in his hellish tyranny, which he has usurped, says
and ouersayeth that he is the vicar of Jesus Christ, and the successor of his
Apostles. And all the cankerwormes of his Clergy who name themselves Prelates,
together with all the horned beasts and all the rabble of Maskers in the
Popedom, will needs challenge that honorable title: and (if a man list too
believe them upon their single word) they be all of them descended of the
Apostles. But yet for all that, it behooves us to consider what likeness and
agreablenesse they have too the Apostles: and also it stands them on hand too
show by certain and infallible record, that their calling is approved of God.
In these days the Pope and all his, are too openly proved too have falsified
and corrupted the doctrine of the Gospel, and that the thing which they term
the seruis of God, is nothing but stark abomination: and moreover, that there
is nothing among them, but outrageous lies and falsehodes, yea and
inchauntments of Satan. All this is known well enough. But behold, their
shield wherewith they cast the mist that covers al their filthiness, is that
there has bin a continual succession, ever since the time of the Apostles,
and that they represent the^ and are the Church, and therefore that whatsoever
they put forth must be taken for good. Well, gooto, if they which do
nowadayes take that title upon them will be herd: they must look whither they
have any resemblance of the Apostles, and whither they execute the duty of
good and faithful shepeherds. But seeing they be clean contrary to the order
which our Lord Jesus Christ has set in his Church, what shall men say to them?
Yea (say they) but we have a continual succession from the Apostles. That
would be showed first of all. They will allege some records, howbeit very
triflyng ones. Yet notwithstanding, it may be said on the contrary part, that
there were as good successors in the Church of Galatia, as ever there was in
Rome: and not only in some one Church, but in many, as well of Ephesus, of
Colossus, and of Philippos, as of other places. And where is all this
succession now? If any man think himself to have any privilege, and name
himself S. Paul's successor: it were meet he should go preach the Gospel,
and therwithall show good evidence why he should be rereyued. Therefore let us
mark well at a word, that when there are men to preach the Gospel, and when
there are Shepeherds and Overseers, it is not meant that they should diminish
the authority of God, or prejudice aught that belongs to him, that is to
wit, that he alonly should not be honored, and that our faith should not rest
upon his word: but that by the means of men, we should always be hild under
his obeisance. Mark that for a special point. And above all things our Lord
reserueth that right to himself: namely that men should not thrust themselves
in through their own presumption, but that they should be raised up and sent by
him. Now therefore (as I have erst said) there ought to be cause why, too the
end we may discern and not believe at all adventure, nor at randon. For Satan's
champions can boast and crake enough and too much, and stand in their own
conceyt to the uttermost, to the intent to wind themselves in by their
presumptuousnesse. But it behooves us to try what is in them, that we may be
sure of Gods calling. And how does S. Paul speak of it here? Not on the
behalf of men (says he) nor by men. When S. Paul says that he is an
Apostle, not on the behalf of men: it is a general point which ought too
extend to all the ministers of Gods word, and too all Shepeherds of the
Church. For (as I have said heretofore) whereas it pleased God that there
should be Prophets in old time, and that afterward there should be
shepeherdes too teach his people: he bereft not himself of his soueraintie: but
rather it was too show, that men must not govern here after their own lust,
and in the mean while be but as Ciphers in Algorisme themselves, saving only
for maynteyning still the title, but that we should all of us give ear unto
him, so as the men whom he sets in office, should be as instruments or
vessels of his holy spirit. Now then we see whereat S. Paul amed, when he
said that he was not sent on the behalf of men: for thereby he shows that he
was authorized of God, and that he was his servant. The second point where he
says that he was not sent by men, belongs peculiarly too the Apostles. For
although that we be called of God, and that he allow of us: yet are we
nevertheless called of men: and if that manner of calling were not agreeable
too Gods will, S. Paul would not have used it. We know how Saint Paul
proceeded in that case, namely how that in every place where he came, he
ordained Ministers and Shepeherdes by election: and no doubt but that doing of
his was lawful. Then let us mark well, that Saint Paul does not
indiscreetly here condemn such as were called by men's means: but only
treats of the thing that was peculiar too the charge of an Apostle. For that
was the difference between the Apostles, and such as had charge of particular
Churches: according whereunto the same state remains at this day, and shall
remain to the worlds end. For the Apostles were not chozen by election of
men, nor by the common policy of the Church: but by the very mouth of the
Son of God. Act. 1. d. 24
In so much that when it behooved the Apostles too put another successor in the
room of Judas, too make up the full number of twelve again: although they
themselves were there present, and a great multitude of Disciples with them:
yet durst they not make any election. When there was any choozing of a
Shepeherde for the Church of Jerusalem, or of Antioche, or of any other
people, this fashyon was used: that is too say, first they prayed snto God,
and therevppon choze such a man as was found meet and convenient for that
office. But as for the other, they referred it wholly too the will of God, and
cast lottes for it, as for a thing that passed their wit. The cause (as I
said) was, for that it behooved the Apostles too be chozen by special
privilege from above, because they were the persons by whom the Gospel was
too be published over the whole world. Now as for S. Paul, he was chozen
afterward. But howsoever it was, he had equal privilege with the residue,
because there came a revelation from heaven, too show that he was admitted too
the executing of that office: 2. Cor. 12. a. 2.
he was rapted up intoo the third heaven, and we have seen that he was well
lyked of in all things. Finally, that it might appear too be Gods will too
give him a larger commission, and too have marked him out for the Apostle of
the Gentyles: he had the holy Ghost immediately, which spoke and uttered the
word from above. Ye see then that S. Paul was not chozen by means of men.
And yet notwithstanding, this manner of choozing (as I said before) is no fault
in those that are Shepeherdes and Ministers of the Church. But it was
requisite that S. Paul should be privileged, too the intent he might be
comparable with Peter and John, and with all those that had bin conversant and
kept company with the son of God, while he dwelled in this world, and was
in this mortal life. Now we see in effect whereat S. Paul amed. And hereby
we be taught, that the reverence which we owe too such as carry abroad Gods
word and bear the name of Shepeherdes, serves not too bar God from being
herd continually, nor to bar our Lord Jesus Christ from being the only
Schoolemayster of the Church. It behooves us too bear this school point well
in mind, or else our faith will always be subject too many varieties, and he
that is cunningest among men, shall ever go away with the gole: and so shall
we have nothing certain, but we shall be still chaungyng from day too day,
yea even every minute of an hour. Wherefore let us mark well, that if men
allege the names of the Church, of Prelates, or of Bishops: we must
always come back too this point, that they cannot climb any higher than too
be the servants of Jesus Christ, and to be allowed of him. And how shall we
know that they be allowed of him? First if they have bin chozen by lawful
order, with calling upon the name of God. And secondly if such be chozen as
are meet, that have in them wherewith to execute their office. Lo here the
marks whereby we may know and be well assured, that they be such Shepeherdes
as God allows and accepts. And herewithall it is not enough for a man too
be called too that vocation: but he must also execute the charge that is
committed too him, according as S. Paul says not singly that he was ordained
an Apostle: but in taking that name too him, he shows that he is sent to
bear abroad the message of salvation, and too preach the Gospel too the
world. Therefore they that will be taken for Bishops and Prelates, must teach: and
if they be Idolles and dumb dogs, it is certain that as they do shamefully
mock Gods name and abuse his majesty, so also men may reject them and despize
them, yea and that they ought too be hild as accursed, because they pretend
Gods name falsely. Thus ye see what we have to mark upon this streyne. Now S.
Paul says purposely, that ^e was sent of Jesus Christ, and of God his
father who rayzed him from the dead. Whereas he says that he was sent of
Jesus Christ, it is too bring us back too the thing which I have touched
already: that is to wit, that if we covet too obey God and to be subject to
him, we must embrace our Lord Jesus Christ, and give ear unto him as too the
only schoolemayster: and both great and small must submit themselves to him and
too his doctrine: for he that honoreth not the Son, honoreth no^ the father,
as it is said in the fifth of John. John. 5. d. 23.
And this is well worthy too be marked: for every man will needs be thought
to honor God, and to desire nothing so much as too hold himself under his
yoke. But in the meanewhyle, we see that the world fights against the
Gospel, and noman can willingly find in his heart to yield too it. When it
comes to the point that Jesus Christ calls us to him, every of us plays
the rebel: we be so wild that he cannot tame us: whereby our faythlesnesse is
to plainly proved, and we show ourselves to despize God, how goodly
protestatio^s soever we have made before. For he sends us back to his Son,
Psalm. 2. b. 12.
and wills us to stoop to him to do him homage. Yet notwithstanding, as we
see and as experience shows too much, every man would shrink away from
subjection too our Lord Jesus Christ. S. Paul therefore shows what a
majesty there is in Jesus Christ: that is too wit, that we ought too tremble
at his word, and to hold our peace when soever he speaks, and too receive
without any gainsaying, whatsoever he teaches, or proceeds from him. And
without that, it is certain that God rejects all the protestations that we
can make of our desirousnesse too serve and honor him. Thus are we exhorted
in this streyne, to give our selves wholly over unto our Lord Jesus Christ,
seeing he is our [only] Shepeherd, thereby to show that we be his true sheep,
and that we harken too his voice, and discern it from the voice of
strangers. Now seeing that God shows himself in such wise unto us, as we
know that our Lord Jesus Christ calls us too him: let every of us follow
him, and show that we be of his flock in deed. Thus ye see what we have too
bear in mind. Howbeit for as much as there is such unthankfulness in a great
number, that they cannot find in their hearts too submit themselves even too
the Son of God: Saint Paul does here set down the name of God the father
as an Overplus. True it is that the whole fullness of the Godhead dwells in
Jesus Christ, Coloss. 1. c. 29. and 2. b. 9.
and cursed be he that seeks any other God. But yet for all that, for as much
as our Lord Jesus Christ appeared unto us in the shape of man, and was
conversant in this world, and there despized yea and abaced even too a most
shameful death, wherein he received all the curses that were due unto us:
therefore it is said that if we give not ear too the Son of God, the father
is prejudiced thereby, according also as our Lord Jesus himself declares in
that he says, Luke. 10. c. 16.
He that despizeth you despizeth me, and he that rejects me rejects the
living God that sent me. Mark then whereunto the order tends which S. Paul
keeps: namely that if we do not willingly honor our Lord Jesus Christ, by
accepting his doctrine for certain and infallible: God is set at naught, and we
cannot say that our intent is too woorship him, for he will reject all our
doyngs. And why? For (as I said before) it is enough too prove us rebels, if
we separate the Son from his Father. And S. Paul adds expressly, that
Jesus Christ was rayzed from the dead, too the end that his Apostleship should
not be the less esteemed, and also that men should match him with the number
and company of the other Apostles, according also as he was added too them
after that Jesus Christ ceased too be any more upon earth. For (as I have
touched already) the thing wherewith the false Apostles which came too
overthrow all vpbrayded him, was this: How now [sayd they]? He has not bin
the Disciple of the Son of God as Peter and John were: he is a thing borne
out of seazon. And how ca^ he show that he has received his doctrine of Jesus
Christ? S. Paul declares that if they will needs inquyre of the authority
of our Lord Jesus Christ, his ryzing again ought not too have diminished it.
Surely though our Lord Jesus Christ were brought low while he had the veyle of
man's nature upon him, whereby his glory was after a sort hidden: yet was he
not abaced in himself. Luke 2. b. 13.
For we know that the Angels acknowledged him for their sovereign king, and
although he were [borne] in a stable and laid upon the ground as a creature
destitute of all help: yet we see that the Stars of the sky bare record of
him. Mat. 2. b. 2.
To be short, the majesty of our Lord Jesus Christ was always sufficiently
avouched, as long as he was in this world. But yet for all that, there was a
much excellenter glory in his resurrection, according as it is said in the
first too the Romans, Romans 1. a. 4
that then he was showed too be the Son of God. And we also have seen in
the second Epistle to the Corinthians, 2. Cor. 4. d. 14.
that as he suffered under weakness of the flesh, so he was rayzed again
through the wonderful power of Gods spirit. So then, S. Paul shows, that
although our Lord Jesus Christ be not conversant with us nowadayes, yet must
not his Majesty therefore be diminished nor defaced, that we should not
yield him his due and deserved obedience, and receive his word reverently
without all gaynesaying. This warning is very behooffull for us. For what a
number of lightheaded persons do we see, which would have Jesus Christ too
be here in visible shape? Their saying is, that they would feign see Jesus
Christ conversant here beneathe, and that [then] they would at the first push
accept what soever he spoke to the^, so as there should need but one word of
his mouth to ravish them, and there should need none other teaching, nor any
other man to be much with us. Yea, but the Son of God which came down, has
performed his charge which was committed to him of God his father: that is to
say, he has preached the Gospel, and sufficiently confirmed it by his death
and passion. Afterward being rizen again, he sent forth his Apostles. And
now that he has all sovereign dominion, so as the Angels bow their knees
before him, and that he has such a majesty as surmounteth all glory both in
heaven and earth: ought not all that which he has done, to suffize us
thoroughly? When it pleases him too send us mortal men, and too send forth
the message and inestimable treasure of his Gospel in brittle vessels, and
yet notwithstanding will have us to receive them: is it not a mockery to say,
that if Jesus Christ were with us and in our company, we would obey him? For
if heaven and earth must be feign too quake under him, and his Majesty be
known even to the Devils of hell: and yet for all that, we continue blockish,
and pretend that he is to far of from us: yet notwithstanding our Lord Jesus
shows sufficiently that he has not forsaken us, seeing we have the Gospel
preached unto us: And that although he dwell not with us here by low in
visible shape, yet notwithstanding we shall be continually joined with him, and
that forasmuch as he is our head, he will govern his body, and there shall be
one inseperable bond betwixt him and us. Now seeing it is so, we ought of right
to yield him obedience, and his resurrection ought to touch us to the quick,
and to work such a reverent awefulnesse in us, that whenever the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ is spoken of, Esa. 65. c. 16
we may be sure that it is the name whereof the Prophet speaks, whereby all
men ought to swear, and whereat they ought to bow their knees. Thus ye see in
effect that the thing which we have to bear in mind, is, that we should not
measure the Gospel after the respect and reputation of those that speak unto
us, for why, they be frail men. Another is that the thing whereon we ought to
stay: for that were as much too say, as we should settle our salvation upon
the credit of men, which might cause us too rest upon the world: but we must
understand, that it is Jesus Christ which speaks. And how? In the Majesty
that is given him by God his father: for the power of the holy Ghost was then
showed too the full, when he was raised from the dead. Then seeing our Lord
Jesus Christ has obtained such authority when he was lifted up into heaven,
as too have superiority over all creatures: let us learn too submit our
selves too him, and let the same serve to hold us in awe, that his word may be
received of us, and we assure ourselves that he governs us, and that it
becomes us too suffer our selves too be taught in his name, and [too
vnderstand] that although the word which is preached unto us proceed out of
the mouth of men, yet notwithstanding it is by the authority of God, and our
salvation must be grounded thereupon, as well as though heaven opened an hundred
thousand times too show us the glory of God. Lo (say I) how it behooves us to
be taught in this world, until God have gathered us into his everlasting
heritage. And that is the thing which we have to bear in mind, concerning
that the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ is expressly set down in this place.

Now let us fall down before the Majesty of our good God with acknowledgment
of our faults, praying him to voutchsafe to make us too feel them, that he
may draw us too repentance the better, and that we may always hope that if we
be once renewed by him, we shall thoroughly perceive that it is he which rules
us by his holy spirit, so as having that record imprinted in our hearts, we
may boast without hypocrisy that we be not tied to this world although we be
in it, and that we dwell in it but as pilgrims and strangers, because we have
a better dwelling place in heaven, where our heritage is thoroughly assured unto
us by faith, although we possess it not presently. That it may please him to
grant this grace, not only to us but also to all people and nations of the
earth, etc.

The. 2 Sermon upon the first Chapter.
3. Grace be unto you and peace from God the father, and [from] our Lord Jesus
Christ.

4. Who gave himself for our sins, to deliver us from this evil world
according too the will of God our father.

5. To whom be glory for evermore, Amen.


THere is no man but he desires his own welfare, and we be inclyned thereto
by nature. Nevertheless we be very far ouerseene in that behalf, and know
not which is the fountain from whence all welfare springs, and much less
what is the true cause of our happiness, namely that God loves us, and that
we be sure that he holds us for his children. For without that, all the
prosperity of the world is nothing, nay rather it shall always turn to our
harm, because that until such time as God receive us into his favor, we be
all of us accursed, and the goods that we receive at his hand shall cost us
right dearly: for they belong not too us, till we be of the fellowship of his
children. Therefore we must above all things seek to be in the favor of our
God, and too be well assured in our selves, that he admits us too be of his
household and Church. And that is the cause why that after the Prophet has
rebuked men's worldly desires, in that one would have abundance of wine, another
abundance of corn, and every man, has an eye to his own ease: Psalm. 4. b. 8.
it is said in the Psalm, that nothing is better nor more too be desired,
than that God should show us the light of his countenance: that is too say,
than that we might take hold of his favor, not doubting but he will
acknowledge us for his children, as I told you before. And that also is the
cause, why in the hundred and sixth Psalm the Prophet craves above all
things, Psalm. 106. a. 4.
that God should be mindful of him with the favor that he bears toward
his people. He knew well enough that he wanted many things: and yet he
ouerpassed all the rest, because his heart carried and haled him the other way,
namely [too desire] too be comprehended in the number of Gods chozen, and
therefore he says purposely according to the Love which thou bear
toward thy people. True it is that God gives oftentimes some sign of his
love too all men in general: but yet is all Adams offspring cut off from him,
till we be greffed in again by Jesus Christ. Therefore there is one kind of
love which God bears toward all men, for that he has created them after
his own image, in which respect he makes the Sun too shine upon all men,
nurrishing them and having a care of their life. But all this is nothing, in
respect of the special goodness which he keeps in store for his chozen,
and for those that are of his flock: howbeit not for any worthiness which
he finds in them, but for because it pleases him too accept them for his
own. And so ye see why S. Paul in all his Epistles brings us back too the
grace of God, and too the love which he bears toward the faithful, saying,
Grace and peace be unto you. Under the word Peace (as I have said
heretofore) he comprehends all prosperity, as if he should beseech God too
provide us of all things which he knows too be expedient for us, too pour
out his Riches upon us, and too show himself so bountiful toward us, as
we may have cause too magnify his goodness. Yet notwithstanding, for as much
as all the goods of the world cannot but turn too our harm, until we be in
Gods favor: therefore Saint Paul keeps this order, of setting down
continually Gods grace or free favor before the benefits which he bestows
upon us. Although then that we must desire God to make us feel his goodness
in all things which he knows to be meet for us: yet must we not forget the
principal point, that is too wit, that he should take us into his Church, and
assure us in our hearts that he bears us good will. When we once see that
light, Psalm. 4. b. 7
let it suffyze us (as it is said in the Psalm) and let the same content us.
But yet for all that although God give us leave too wish whatsoever is good
for us: yet must we bridle our selves in such wise, that if he list too
smite us with many miseries, we nevertheless must make such account of his
favor, as too content our selves with that alone, though all the rest be taken
quite and clean from us. I have told you already, that although we lived at
our ease in all pleasures and delights, yet should we be unhappy, until such
time as we be fully assured in our consciences, that God loves us, and that we
be in his favor. Ye see then that we ought not too have a mind too any
worldly goods, except Gods love go before them. But on the contrary part, if
God love us, and yet in the mean while list too try our patience by suffering
us too linger in this world, and by putting us under many afflictions: we
must still make such account of his favor, as to bear all things patiently,
not withstanding that they seem to be utterly against us. And it stands us
so much the more on hand too bear this lesson in mind, because we see men
wander away after their own lusts. For most men are become so brutish, that
they desire nothing but to have the things that nature teaches them too like
of: They have no regard at all of God. One desires to eat, and another to
drink, and the third to have apparel: and these are desires that houer in the
air. But the point whereat we ought to begin, is too know that God is the
founder of all our welfare, and that all the commodities which we have in this
world, and all the aids which we have too help us with, are benefits
proceeding from his hand. Then if we cannot apply our desires unto God, it is
too untoward, yea and too beastly a thing: and yet for all that, the most part
of the world is at that point. There are othersome which seem too take a
better way and rule: but yet do they also pervert all. They desire God too
send them the things which he knows too be good and profitable for them: but
in the mean while they look not to the fountain wherout of they should draw
their first water, that is to wit, too be reconciled to God. For all is one
with them so God spare them, and execute not his rigor toward them. As for
his love or hatred, they pass not greatly for it, so he handle them after the
desire and appetite of their flesh. Now although such manner of men do seek
unto God, yet do they set the Cart before the horse. For they ought to set
Gods love in the first and chiefest place, and then to come down to the great
number of benefits which he bestows upon us, and whereby he witnesses his
goodness toward us. Albeit then that many men hold not themselves within the
said measure, but make more unruly requests unto God than one man would do to
another: so as one man craves Riches another Honor, and none is contented
with that which God sends: yet notwithstanding, though men were well aduized
in their wishes, and precize in desiring nothing but that which they have need
of, yet if they forget Gods favor, therein they show themselves not to have
profited at all. Wherefore let us mark how it is not without cause, that S.
Paul has here set down two things jointly together: that is too wit,
that God must first receive us into his favor, so as we also may feel him
to be truly our father, and to accept us as his children: and he thervppon
afterward make us too prosper. Now, such manner of prosperity may (as I have
said already) be well wished for: but yet in the mean while the only goodness
of God must be our solace: and when we be put too the suffering of many
miseries in this world, so as things fall not out as we would have them, yet
must we be contented with this, that God accepts us. And therewithal he
sets down the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, because it is not possible
that God should favor us, but for his own sons sake in whom is his whole
delight, according as it is said, Ephesians. 1. b. 6.
as well in the. xvi chapter of S. Matthew, as in the first too the Ephesians.
Then if we had nothing else to set before our eyes but the majesty of God, it
would make us afraid, and we could not have any access unto him, because we be
frail creatures, yea and altogether sinful, creeping here upon the earth,
and deserving too be swallowed into the bottom of Hell. Therefore it is very
requisite that Christ should show himself unto us, and that we should look
upon him, to taste what Gods love is, and to enjoy all the benefits which he
bestows upon us: for they belong not to any other than to his own only
Son, who is the heir of all things, as the Apostle speaks of him in the
first chapter to the Hebrews. Hebr. 1. a. 2
Seeing then that all the good turns which God does us, belong peculiarly too
our Lord Jesus Christ: it behooves us too communicate with him, and to be made
parttakers of them by his means. Therefore it is not without choose that S.
Paul says here, from God the father and from our Lord Jesus Christ. Yea and
too the intent too give us the greater assurance that God will take us into his
favor (if we seek him truly and unfeignedly,) howbeit by the means of his
only Son: he says that Jesus Christ gave himself for our sins. Now it is
certain that nothing puts us out of Gods favor, but our own sinfulness.
For we see that his mercy extends it self even to the Sparowes that fly in
the air, and unto the brute beasts. For when as God brings forth grass in
the mountains, and makes other fodder too grow for cattle: Psa. 104. b. 14.
and 147. b. 8.
it is a token that he has a care of them. And truly they be marks of his
goodness, as it is said in the Psalms. How then should he not love those whom
he has created after his own image, and which approach much nearer too him,
and to his nature, that is to say, men? God therefore in respect of his creating
of us, receives and auoweth us for his own. But for so much as we be corrupted
and our nature is become sinful, it causes God too hate us and too take us for
his enemies, so as there is as it were a deadly foade between him and us, till
he have taken us again into his favor for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake.
Wherefore to the end we may nor have any cause to doubt of Gods love, S. Paul
does here set down before us the Sacrifize whereby the rememberance of our
transgressions is blotted out, so that God having now forgotten all our
wretchedness, beholds us as his own, and as those on whom he has set his
mark, and (to be short) as those whom he has created too be his children and
heirs. And hereby we be warned, that there is none other means to pacify
our consciences, and to make us able to call upon God in full liberty, but by
applying too our selves the sacrifize offered by our Lord Jesus Christ,
wherein he has made full satisfaction [for vs], so that henceforth God
receives us as his own children. And here first of all we see the force of
the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, how that therein we find
atonement between God and us, so that whereas we were erst at odds with him,
and he must needs have (as ye would say) abhorred us: now he voutchsafeth too
take us into his favor* And why? Because our Lord Jesus Christ has made
amends for all our faults and misdeedes, by the obedience which he yielded in
his death and passion, in so much that the sacrifize which he offered was a
[full] satisfaction for [all] our sins, and his bloodshed became likewise our
clenzing, and has washed us clean from all the spots of our sins. Thus ye
see how we may be sure that God receives us. And how may we have the boldness
to call upon him and to resort unto him? Even by fastening our eyes upon the
Sacrifize which our Lord Jesus Christ has offered. For if we have not that, it
is certain that we shall always be afraid, when we think upon the majesty of
God. For seeing we be wretched offenders, how should we not be afraid of our
judge, who is armed to execute the vengeance that we deserve? Nevertheless for
as much as our Lord Jesus Christ has buried our faults, we may come unto God
boldly and without any stop. Howbeit it behooves us to mark therewithal, that
the sacrifize whereby our Lord Jesus Christ has reconciled us to God his
father, is so sufficient, that it behooves us to lay* up all our trust therein,
and not to seek any other means: according also as S. Paul's intent here, is
to bring back the Galathians to the pure truth from the which they had bin
led away and seduced not that they had utterly renounced Jesus Christ, but that
they had intermingled the ceremonies of the Law, thereby to obtain
forgiveness of sins, as who should say there needed other helps thereunto:
according as in papistrie it will well enough be granted, that Jesus Christ is
the redeemer of the world, but yet therwithal every man seeks to co^pound
with God, and to make amends by himself. Now the Galathians had already bin
imbured with the like error. For this cause Saint Paul shows the, that
sins are none otherwize wiped out, than by the sacrifize of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to the intent that our faith may rest wholly there. Therefore if we will be,
parttakers of so great a benefit, we must give over al our vain hopes, and
all the illusio^s that the Devil puts in our mind, when he turns us
aside from our Lord Jesus Christ and from his only grace, by making us to
believe that we can come unto God, if we bring some amends with us. To be
short, until such time as we be sure that there is none other washing
wherewith to skoure out the spots of our iniquities, but the blood which our
Lord Jesus Christ has shed, and wherewith we be rinced through the holy ghost:
it is certain that we ca^ never come freely unto God, nor rest upon his favor
and love, but shall ever be wandering in our own imaginacions: and that shall be
a due payment for our misbelefe, in that we have not yielded our Lord Jesus
Christ the honor that he deserved. Thus ye see in effect what we have to bear
in mind here, where S. Paul sets the death and passion of our Lord Jesus
Christ before us, telling us that that is the thing wherein we shall find the
amends of all our faults, do as they shall not be called any more too account
before God. And he says purposely that Jesus Christ gave himself too the end
we should the more boldly take hold of his Love. For we see here, that when
our Lord Jesus Christ did put forth himself too make atonement between God
and us, he spared not his own body and soul, in so much that he endured
extreme anguish in his foul, as he that was our borrow in the same, and bare
the wrath of God in our behalf. And in his body also he endured all reproach
and shame, and therewithal also the horriblest torments that could be deuized
and all this (as I said before) shows right well, that the love which he bare us
was inestimable, since he forgate himself after that sort for our sakes. But yet
notwithstanding, herewithall S. Paul brings us always back too the will of
God, too show that when our Lord Jesus Christ did in that wyze perform all
that belonged too our salvation, it was no let but that God in the mean while
uttered his mercy in the same, according as it is said in another text, John.
3. b. 16
that God so loved the world, that he spared not his only son, but delivered
him to death for us. To the intent therefore that we should not think that the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ too pacify God his father, was after such a
sort that he persuaded him to alter his purpose, (as men are inclined to such
gross and earthly imaginacions:) S. Paul (to show us that God was not
reconcyled unto us after the manner of men) tells us expressly that the cause
why Jesus Christ was delivered for our sins, was for that God had so ordained
it. For if a man be angry with his child, some other man may step in, too
appease his wrath, and such a one shall supply the room of a third party. But
the case stood not so with our Lord Jesus Christ when he offered himself in
Sacrifize too do away all our sins, and to make us way unto God from whom we
were shet out before. He came not as one that stepped in of his own head, and
as though God had not meddled with the matter. How then? God (as has bin
touched not long since (did both hate us and love us before the reconciliation
[was made.] And why loved he us? Because we be his creatures. And again,
although he saw we were so wretched, and utterly forlorn and damned folk by
reason of sin: yet notwithstanding he had pity upon us, and would not have
mankind to perish utterly. Thus ye see how God loved us, notwithstanding that
in the person of Adam we were fallen away from him and utterly corrupted.
Therwithall he did also hate us, even because he is the welspring of all
righteousness. Therefore he abhorred the naughtiness that was in us by reason
whereof there needed an attoneme^t to be made in the blood of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and by the sacrifize which he offered. But yet must not that benefit
be fathered upon any other than God. Ye see then how it was Gods doing too
send his only son, and too give him over unto death for us. And why? To the
end that all hatred between him and us should be done away. This in effect
is the thing that ought to be understood of S. Paul's words, when he says
that Jesus Christ gave himself to the death for our sins, and yet
notwithstanding that the same came not too pass without the will of God, who
had determined the same aforehande in his own everlasting purpose. Here first
of all we have too magnify the mercy that was showed us, in the person of our
Lord Jesus Christ. For if God had [but] proclaimed a pardon, and told us that
he would take us to mercy though we were unworthy of it: that had bin very
much, yea and it had bin impossible for us to magnify such a gracious
goodness as it deserves. But seeing he has lent us such a gage of his love
as his own son, and gives himself to us in his person, [thereby] showing
himself to be our father: it so far passes all that we have said, that if
all our wits were employed too woondering at such a goodness, yet should
we never come to the fullness thereof. Thus ye see what we have to mark in
the first place, when Saint Paul speaks too us of Gods will. [Howbeeit] let
us understand, that even from the time that God had just cause to hate us, and
to abhor us, yea and [euen from the time] that we were his enemies (as the
Scripture says) in very deed he never ceased to have some regard of us, To.
5. b. 10.
and to extend his pity so far forth, as he would not have us to abide in
our destruction: in so much that he has not thought it enough to declare the
same by word of mouth, but also has given us such a pledge as we see, that is
to wit, that his own son has answered for it. Now seeing it is so that God
has showed himself so gracious and merciful before we were reconciled to
him: what will he do now when we have so sure a warrant, and that the Gospel
also is preached unto us, to assure us that we be knit unto our Lord Jesus
Christ by faith, as members of his body? Shall we now doubt of Gods love
toward us when we have so good a confirmation of it, as Saint Paul faith in
the fifth Chapter to the Romans? If so be that Jesus Christ (says he) came to
put away all our sins at such times as there was yet deadly foad between god
and us: ought not all doubting to be trodden under foot, and we not be afraid
in any wise too call upon our God, but assure our selves of our own salvation,
now when God has so confirmed it unto us, when he has admitted us into his
favor, when he calls and allureth us as gently as may be, and when he
shows and certefieth us that he does as it were hold open his arms to
embrace us, whenever we will come unto him? Thus ye see what we have to bear
in mind in this streyne. Furthermore, let us mark also the love of our Lord
Jesus Christ, how that seeing he has given himself after that sort for our
sins, he will not suffer his death and passion to be unprofitable, nor the
sacrifice which he has once offered, to be void and of none effect, without
bringing forth fruit in us. But as he has offered himself once for all: so
also will he be our continual Mediator and Advocate, to the end we may be
partakers of the clennesse which he has purchased for us, that being rid of
all our fowlenesse we may appear [cleane] before God, and speak unto him with
open mouth. Lo how we ought to gather together all the things that are showed
us here for the stablishing of our faith, and that we may freely resort unto
our God, not as strangers to him, but as his own children and familiar
friends. And herewithall let us learn also, to shake off all the illusions
and fancies of Satan, who seeks by all means too turn us away from our
Lord Jesus Christ, or else to darken the grace which we should find in him:
and when he can not abolish it utterly, he snarleth us and puts [new] means
into our heads whereby to purchase favor at Gods hand. But let us cut off all
such things, and so fasten all our wits upon our Lord Jesus Christ, as he
only my suffize us, and we utterly mislyke whatsoever shall come in our head
too purchase grace and favor with, assuring our selves that there is not any
other thing that may cause God to receive us to mercy, than the sacryfize
whereby all righteousness and clennesse was purchased for us. Furthermore,
under these words of Gods will, it behooves us too comprehend a free
goodness, too exclude all that men are wont too make themselves believe of
their own merits: for in that sense also are those words taken in the holy
Scripture, so that (as I have told you before) the thing which is termed here
by the name of Will, is termed elsewhere by the name of good pleasure. Saint
Paul therefore not only shows that the welspring of our Redemption and
Salvation consists in the ordinance and everlasting purpose of God the
father: Luc. 2. b. 14
but also intends to beat down all pride and presumption, by showing that we
must yield the whole praise of our righteousness too the free favor of God,
which had no regard at all of our deseruings. For let us examine our selves:
and what shall God find in us but utter wretchedness? And that is the very
cause why God voutsafeth his mercy upon us. So then let us assure our selves,
that henceforth we may freely lift up our eyes to heaven, and prefer our
prayers and supplications unto God, John. 3. b. 16
because he has prevented us, according as it as said in S. John, that he had
not tarried till we loved him, (for that was impossible because we be wholly
bent unto evil, and are utterly given over to it:) but had loved us even
though we were his enemies. And so ye see that the appearing of our Lord Jesus
Christ, was too the end too reconcile us to God his father, as we have showed
already. That therefore is in effect the thing that we have to bear in
mind. Now Saint Paul adds immediately, that it was to deliver us from this
wicked world. Here he shows why we be called too the knowledge of our
Lord Jesus Christ: and also why he has set so great store by us, as to
redeem us as he has done: [namely] to the end we should not abide in our
filth and uncleanness, but be withdrawn away from it by him. In very deed
that is not the cause of our salvation, but the end and mark whereat God looked
[in ordeyning us to salvation.] The thing therefore which it stands us on
hand to have an eye unto when our redemption is spoken of, is that we must
begin at the free favor which God bare unto us, when he determined in his
everlasting purpose, that we should be brought back again unto him by the
means of our Lord Jesus Christ. And so, that was the principal cause.
Another cause thereof is Jesus Christ, in whom we find all that is requisite
for our assurance. For there we see our sins blotted out, inasmuch as he is
ordained to be our borrow, and has made such amends for us, as nothing can
stop us from coming too God. That is the second point which we have too
remember here. Now the mean whereby we be made partakers of our Lord Jesus
Christ, is our embracing of the promises of the Gospel by true faith. For the
faythlesse have no profit at all by the death and passion of our Lord Jesus
Christ, but rather are so much the more damnable, because they reject the mean
that God had ordained: and their unthankfulness shall be so much the more
grievously punished, because they have trodden under foot the blood of our
Lord Jesus Christ, which was the ransom for their souls. Therefore it
stands us on hand to receive the promises of the Gospel by faith, if we
desire that Jesus Christ should communicate himself unto us, and that he
should bring us to the possession and inioyment of the benefits which he has
purchased for us: so as they belong not too any other than such as are members
of his body, and are graffed into him, and receive him by faith, according as
it is said in the first Chapter of Saint John, John. 1. b. 12
that God accepts and avouches those for his children, which believe in his
only son. Thus ye see what we have to remember in the third place, when we
come too the scanning of our salvation. Now remains that God be glorified
in us, as good reason is that he should be. And in that respect also, Saint
Paul in the third to the Romans says, that whereas God has given us the
means in our Lord Jesus Christ, To. 3. d. 25.
too find favor at his hand by the forgiveness of our sins, and there
withal sent us the Gospel to put us in possession of the same benefit: his so
doing is to the end that he only may appear to be righteous, and be
glorified therefore, so as we should yield him all praise, and acknowledge our
selves beholden to him for all things. Nevertheless the glorifying of God
consists not only in our confessing with our mouth that he is the author of
our salvation, and that the same comes of him alonely: and of his mere
goodness and free grace: but also in becoming new men through his holy
spirit, so as his image shines forth in us, and we indeuer to give over our
selves wholly to his service. 1. These. 4. b. 7.
It is said, that God has not called us to filthiness and uncleanness, but
that his meaning is too make us holy to himself. Now then seeing the case
stands so: it is not for naught that Saint Paul adds here, that Jesus
Christ has delivered liuered us from this wicked world by offering himself
for us, and that he has wyped out the remembrance of our sins before God his
father, to the end we should not lie any longer plunged in our own filth and
uncleanness, but be as it were separated from the world* to the intent to
become the heritage of God, and to dispose our whole life to such obedience, as
it may be seen that like as he has adopted us to be his children, so we also
have loved and honored him as our father. And out of all doubt, when as it is
said that we must be taken out of this wicked world, it is a benefit which we
ought to be abashed at. For under the word World, is comprehended all that
belongs to man in his own nature. The world of it self has in it neither
vice nor corruption: but all the euilnesse of it comes of the sin that
dwells in us. So then, whereas it is said that the world is wicked, 1. Iohu
(...) 19.
according also as S. John in his canonical Epistle says that all the world
is saped and plunged in naughtiness: that wickedness is neither in the Sun,
nor in the Moon, nor in the earth, nor in the water, nor in any of all the
things that are contained in them: but in that we be so perverted, that we have
infected all things here bilowe with our uncleanness: and that as long as men
continue in themselves and in their own nature, they be but filthiness, so
as they must of necessity displease God. For surely there can be none
agreement between righteousness and unrighteousness. But in us there is
nothing to be found but unrighteousness. Therefore we must either be
withdrawn from our selves, or else we shall never be able to come nie unto
God. What shall then become of all the blind wretches, which bear themselves
in hand that they be able to work wonders with their free will, their virtues,
their wisdom, and I wot not what else? According as we see that men do always
like well of themselves, and although they be convicted to have nothing but
filthiness in them, and that they be so loathsome as it is pity to see it, and
they themselves ought to be ashamed of it: yet they will still challenge somewhat
to themselves, and always deceive themselves with their own fond
imaginations. And yet notwithstanding when men have well tried themselves, all
that they can find in them shall be condemned under the term of naughtiness
[or wickedness:] insomuch that it is showed thereby, that there is nothing but
corruption in us, and that if we presume too preace unto God as we be of our
selves, he must needs drive us a great way of. Therefore mark this for a
ground, that here all pride is beaten down, too the intent that men may
learn too leave their boasting in any thing, save in the free goodness of
God, and be so abashed in considering their own shame, that they may condemn
themselves with their own mouth, and not tarry til God give sentence against
them, but become their own judges. This is it in effect which we have to
mark. And now we see how it behooves us to walk warely and carefully; that we
may be assured that the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ belongs to
us. For if we will needs give bridle too our Iustes, it is certain that our
Lord Jesus Christ will disclayme us. True it is that our Salvation rests
always upon the only goodness of God, and that we must not intermeddle our
own works when we intend too have the certainty of faith, but rather
renounce our selves. Nevertheless howsoever the case stands, our Lord Jesus
Christ is not come to give us occasion too abuse the grace that he has
purchased us, for that were a mocking of him to his face. If we should go
wallow again in our own filthiness after that he has washed us in his
blood, were it not a wilful defyling of the thing that is most holy, ye a and
which makes all the whole world holy? Now forasmuch as we are all of us
corrupted, and the whole world is subject to cursing, and all of us are
condemned: there is not any thing to sanctify us again, but [onely] the blood
of our Lord Jesus Christ. And how great and intolerable a treachery were it,
if we as much (as in us lies) should fall to beraying of our selves again in
our own filthiness? The^ let us mark well, that to enjoy the fruit of the death
and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, we must not take liberty to do evil, nor
to live after our own appetites and lusts: but we must always come to the
separation whereof S. Paul speaks here, which is to be withdrawn from this
wicked world, and not to break asunder the things that are knit together with
so holy a band, nor to disanull the order of God. The faithful therefore must
give themselves to all pureness of life, and consider that the redeeming of
them by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the sacrifice of his death and passion,
is upon condition that they should forsake themselves, according also as we
heerehow our Lord Jesus Christ tells us, Mark. 8* d, 34.
that those which will be his disciples, must abace themselves and follow him.
What have we the^ to do, and what ought to be our travel all the time of our
life? We must do our indeuer to withdraw our selves from the defilementes of
this world, that we may cleave unto our God in pureness of life. True it is
that this thing is not perfected in us until we be quite withdrawn from the
world: but yet that is the mark that we must ame at, and whereunto it behooves
us to draw more and more. Then like as the faithful resort continually to Gods
mercy, grounding themselves thereupon, and are not otherwise righteous than by
the forgiveness of their sins: so also behooves it them to keep on to the
end which S. Paul sets down to us here, which is to be separated from the
world. And those two things are well worthy to be marked. Some fantastical
persons have imagined such a perfection, that when we be once regenerated in
our Lord Jesus Christ, we have no more need of the forgiveness of our sins.
Insomuch that they say we keep the world still to their Apsie, when we
preach that we, cannot become righteous but by faith, nor come in Gods favor
but by his forgiving of our sins, and by his covering of the^ through his own
goodness. But that is a devilish pride, and yet among Papists there is no more
praise than that given unto Gods goodness. So then let us abhor such
harebraynes, and all their blasphemies, when they go about to be witch us so
far, as too make us believe that we have no more need too be pitied of God,
nor to have our sins forgiven us. But let us trust unto it, that it stands
us on hand to sigh and groan al our life long, and that there is none other
hope to assure us of our salvation, but first to yield our selves guilty, and
then to be out of all doubt that the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ does
continually wash us pure and clean. Mark that for one point. And therwithall
let our endeavor always be to be separated from this wicked world. And how?
Even by praying unto God too touch us first with his holy spirit, and
afterward too increase his gifts in us, and too mortify the lusts of the
flesh. And sith we feel such a battle, so as we be feign too enforce our
selves, or else that we do but lympe and halt in going unto God, insomuch
that we make many a false step, and oftentimes happen to trippe and stumble:
let us mourn continually seeing we fail at all assayes. Thus ye see how we
may be delivered from this wicked world. [Namely] not by being set utterly
free from sin, like as also when S. Paul says that God has delivered us
[from our sinnes] to the intent we should live perfectly, and undefiled before
him, it is not for that there can be found any such pureness in any man so
long as he is in this world: for all our thoughts do continually rebel
against God, yea and even the righteoussest men of all shall evermore find
themselves behind hand, and perceive that they do still dragge their legs
after them. But yet howsoever the world go, we perceive on the other side,
that our Lord Jesus Christ has already ridded us by faith out of the bondage
of the Devil, and will maintain us against all assaults. If we fall to
examination, and every man try what is in himself, we shall find that when
on the one side there is any good desire in us, so as we seek to honor God:
[on the other side] our own nature leads us the contrary way, so as we
would feign keep aloof from him: insomuch that the faithful must needs
feel both those two motions in them selves, namely that when on the one side
(as Saint Peter cheereth us) the holy Ghost counsels us too give our selves
to all holiness of life: 1. Pet. 2. a. 1
on the other side we feel our selves to be plucked back by many wicked
affections, so as we cannot come near unto God as we feign would do. And that
is the cause why Saint Paul in the vij. To. 7. d. 19.
Chapter too the Romans sigheth and confesses that he is unhappy, because
he cannot do the good that he is desirous to do, nor utterly eschew the evil
that he hates and abhors. Thus ye see that the thing which we have to
mark concerning the deliverance that is mentioned here, is that our Lord
Jesus Christ has not so regenerated us already by his holy spirit, as to set
us in full freedom to walk as we would wish, and to run so swiftly and with
so cheerful a courage as were requisite. But his delivering of us is to make
us hold on our way still toward our mark, that is to say, to make us yield
our selves wholly in obedience unto God, and to withdraw our selves from our
corruptions, and too forsake them more and more, until the time of full
perfection be come, which is, when our Lord God shall have thoroughly repaired
his Image in us. Now by the way, although the Galathians were partly slipped
away, and had given ear to the buzibodies that had disguized the Gospel, and
made such a mingle mangle of it, that Jesus Christ was as good as overwhelmed
and buried: yet notwithstanding S. Paul matcheth them still with the
faithful, for whom the sacrifize was offered, according also as he places
them in the Church of God. He speaks not to the Renegates that had forsaken
Jesus Christ. True it is, that he will anon show them their fault: but yet for
all that, he minds not to exclude them utterly from the hope of salvation.
For there were no cause for him to write to them, if it were not to draw them
back again, and to win them and to bring them again into the good way.
Forasmuch then as S. Paul labors to bring back the Galathians into the way
of salvation (as need was:) therefore he admits them still to the
inestimable benefit that is purchased for us by the son of God, and reckeneth
them still as separated from the world, knitting them to the fellowship of
those whom God accepts and auoweth for his children. And that is, because
there was yet some seed of the Gospel in them, and although they were snarled
in some errors, yet they had not utterly forsaken God, nor gone quite away
from the Gospel. For that consideration therefore, Saint Paul holds them
back, and reckeneth them still in the number of the faithful. And so although
we be not worthy of it, yet will God reckon us as of his householde for his
words sake which is preached among us. No doubt but it shall be to our sorer
damnation, if God call us, and we answer him not. But if we have any good
desire too come unto him, and yet have still many vices and infirmities in us:
he accepts us as his own, for his words sake. And we be called his
Church, Mat. 4. a. 5. and 27. f. 25.
not for that we be worthy of that title, but because that as the City of
Jerusalem was called the holy City in respect of the promises, namely that the
Gospel should come from thence, and that the Redeemer of the world should be
manifested there: so by like reason we be called the faithful, and the
children of God, and are mustered in the array of his Church, when the Gospel
is preached among us, and men consent thereunto, although it be not with such
reverence and perfectness as were meet. Nevertheless, how soever the case
stand, Saint Paul's using of such mildene (...) toward the Galathians, is
not to foad them in their vices, nor too sooth them up with fond flattery
after the manner of many men, whom we see desirous to be flattered after that
sort: but we shall see anon how he rebukes them as sharply as may be, insomuch
that he calls them witless. And how can these things agree together? It is
for that on the one side, he intends to advance the grace of God, which had
bin opened in that Church: and that on the other side, he was feign to scour
away the vices that were in it, as need was. We see then hereby, that when
God has planted his Church in any place, it follows not by and by therefore,
that all things are to be commended there, and that there is nothing but all
godliness in it, as the Papists imagine, who under the name of the Church
would feign cover all their abominations, yea even the most horrible and
diuelishe abominations in the whole world. As how? The Church [say say]
cannot err: 2. Tim. 4. d. 25.
she is the bryde of Jesus Christ: she is the pillar of truth. Yea, but in the
mean while look upon the Churches of Galatia. What says the holy Ghost of
them by the mouth of S. Paul? Among them there were Renegates that had
renounced the Gospel: there were as foul and outrageous heresies among them
as could be. Then let us understand, that we must never be so tied to men, as
not to condemn their faults when they come to the scanning: but that all
things must be made subject to Gods word, and every thing be condemned that
is not agreeable thereunto, so as nothing may hinder God from having his
authority continually, and from putting all things under foot which agree not
with his word, but that men do condemn them, and utterly abhor them.
Furthermore, let us not cease to draw those continually unto God, which have
any entrance already. And although we perceive them to be weak or stepped
aside out of the way: yet let us always set forth Gods grace, that it may
grow and be strengthened more and more in them, until we be all gathered
thither as we be daily called, that is to wit, to our Lord Jesus Christ.

Now let us fall down before the Majesty of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us perceive them more and
more, and that we may be so touched to the quick, as we may mistyke of them,
and so embrace his grace, as it may be more and more increased in us, and we be
hilde up and sustained in our weakness by his hand, until he have brought us
to the holy perfection of the heavenly kingdom, which is purchased for us by
the means of our Lord Jesus Christ. And so let us all say, Almighty God our
heavenly father. etc.

The. 3. Sermon upon the first Chapter.
6 I marvel that you are so suddenly carried away from him that had called you
through the grace of Christ, unto another Gospel.

7 Which is none other thing but that there are some which trouble you, and
would overthrow the Gospel of Christ.

8 But if I my self or an Angel from heaven tell you otherwise than I have
told you: cursed be he.


We see here more openly the thing that I have touched already this morning:
that is to wit, that Saint Paul spares not the Galathians, although he mind
not too shet them out of the gate of salvation. For inasmuch as his meening is
to bring them back to repentance: it is good reason that he should set the
grace of God before them, as a thing common to them. But yet for all that, he
flattereth them not, but rather rebukes them for their faults, and specially
for the ouergreat lightness that was in them in giving ear to deceyuers,
which came unto them to disguize the doctrine of the Gospel. And to make them
perceive their own unthankfulness the better: he says that he wondereth to
see them carried away so soon and so easily from the heavenly calling, and how
it comes to pass that they could be so quickly thrust out of the way, and
continue yet still in their doing, seeing that they had already felt and tried
Gods grace in our Lord Jesus Christ. For inasmuch as he labored to bring the^
back again, he says not at the first dash that they had turned away from the
Gospel, but that they had bin overcome by that temptation. And afterward he
adds, that the same was nothing else, but that those buzibodies intended to
overthrow the truth of God. For there is but one pure doctrine of the Gospel,
like as there is but one Jesus Christ, upon whom the same is grounded: so as it
is not in us to forge a new Gospel, but whenever any body goes about too
mingle any thing with the pure seed which we have of our Lord Jesus Christ,
it is nothing else but an overthrowing of Gods building. This in effect is the
thing which is contained in this first sentence of S. Paul's. But here he might
seem to be over sharp and rough in finding fault with the feebleness of the
Galathians, seeing they never meant to forsake the gospel, nor yet Jesus Christ
who had bin preached among them. Howbeit S. Paul passes not for their
opinion, but has respect to the matter in it self, which is, that as soon as
men turn aside from Gods truth, by and by they forsake Jesus Christ, and make
themselves strangers to him. Many men would think this strange, according as
we see there are many that would feign mingle the light and darkness
together. And specially the confusion that is in Popery is a very notable
example hereof: for there ye shall hear men make wonderful protestations of
holding still the Christian faith wherein they have bin baptized. But yet for all
that it is apparent, that al is turned vpside down: for all superstitions reign
there: and besides that, there is too manifest Idolatry, yea and that as gross
as ever was any among the heathen. By reason whereof al reverence of God is as
good as quite abolished there, because every man makes himself a Savior in
stead of our Lord Jesus Christ. But now will the Papists lustily reply, that
they be no backsliders, nor have forsaken Christ. Yea, but our Lord Jesus
Christ is no Ghost, he cannot transform himself after the appetites of men. To
be short, he cannot be separated from his Church. Whensoever the Papists
utter this saying: they rob Jesus Christ of all authority. For (say they) if
there were but one Mediator, what should become of the Heesaintes which are
patrones, and of the Sheesaintes which are our Advocates* if any man speak to
them of the sacrifice whereby our Lord Jesus Christ has once purchased perfect
righteousness for all the faithful: What (say they) and must not Mass be
said every day, and Christ be offered up new again there, too appeaze Gods
wrath? If a man tell them of the free forgiveness of sins: and what shall
become (say they) of our own satisfactions, whereby we deserve to have pity
at Gods hand? Again, if a man say too them, that all our goodness comes of
our regeneration through Gods spirit, and that there is nothing but spottinesse
and rebelliousnesse in us, till God have changed us: how so (answer they) and
what shall then become of our own free will? To be short, Jesus Christ shall be
named often enough, and men will reserve unto him the title of Redemer. But in the
mean season his office shall be parted, and put too the spoil, and every man
shall catch a portion of it too himself. Besides this, they imagine that the
Saints and Angels of heaven are as patrones to them, and finally they have
infinite ways (to their own seeming) whereby to come unto God. But hereupon we
may well conclude, that the holy Ghost does justly auow them to be backsliders,
and to have given over Jesus Christ, and to be become strangers to him. For
they falsely abuse his name. Jesus Christ is not variable, 1. Co. 1. d. 19
according as we have seen how S. Paul in the second to the Corinthians
said, that we shall not find yea and nay in him, but that he will continue
always at one stay. To be short, whatsoever the Papists babble concerning
Christianity, is altogyther hypocrisy and leasing, and they do but falsify
the name of Gods son, and abuse it wickedly. For they make a mumrie of it, or
rather an Idol. Ye see then why Saint Paul blames the Galathians for being
so carried away. Now if a man demand the reason how: it was in that some
would have made them to observe the ceremonies of the law as things
necessary: and yet had God commanded them. Yea verily, howbeeit that was but
with a temporal condition for the people of old time, so as they must of
necessity have all ceased at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Forasmuch
therefore as the Galathians mingled the old figures and shadows of the law,
with the clear light of the Gospel: Saint Paul being not able too suffer it,
says that they were turned aside from God, yea and utterly fallen away from
him. But there is yet a worse thing than that: namely that the grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ was thereby disanulled, because men do always bear
themselves in hand, that they deserve and earne righteousness before God, to
be in his favor for their serving of him: and so when these deceivers had
brought in the said error, that men ought to keep the old forworne figures: it
was all one as if they had threaped a meritorious service upon God [whither he
would or no.] But our salvation must be of free gift, or else Jesus Christ is
nothing worth. I term it salvation of free gift, because it is given us
simply of God, so as we bring not any thing with us [to the attaynment
thereof] but only an eager desire too be filled with the thing that we want.
Therefore it stands us on hand too come as poor beggars unto God, if we
mind too be justified for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake. For if we imagine
never so small a drop of deserving in our selves, it stops us from coming
too our Lord Jesus Christ. And not without cause does an ancient Doctor say,
that we cannot receive the Salvation that is offered us in our Lord Jesus
Christ, except we have first dispatched the mynding of our own deserts, and
acknowledged that there is nothing but utter wretchedness in our selves. Thus
ye see why Saint Paul had yet more just reason too say, that the Galathians
were carried away from Jesus Christ and from his father. But there was yet this
clogge more: namely that they were made too believe what other men lysted, and
thereby brought in subjection too a slauishe bondage, too be robbed of the
quietness of conscience which we ought too have in our Lord Jesus Christ.
For besides that we be reconcyled by the sacryfize of his death and passion,
we be also set free from the rygor of the law, under the which we were hilde
in bondage. As for example (according as we shall see more fully hereafter, for
as now I do but ouerrunne matters whereof we shall see a larger discourse
afterward.) Deuteronomy. 27. d. 26.
Ye know how it is said in the law, that whosoever performs not all that
God commands to the uttermost point, shall be accursed. But it is impossible
for us to attain too such perfection. Therefore it stood us upon too have
freedom purchased for us by our Lord Jesus Christ, that the Lord might not
any more hold us under his yoke, Act. 15. b. 10
which was intolerable as it is said in the fifteenth of the Acts. Now we
see in effect why Saint Paul blames the Galathians for falling away like
perjured persons toward God, and toward our Lord Jesus Christ, as having
given him the slip, and forsaken the faith which they had plighted unto
him. And by this example we be warned to hold us to the pure doctrine and
simplicity of the Gospel, without wavering one way or other. For it is not
enough to have the name and title of Christians, no nor yet to bear the mark
of baptism: but we must continue steadfast in the doctrine of the Gospel. For
(as I have said heretofore) our Lord Jesus Christ cannot deny himself: and
when we have dreamed this and that of him, yet must we be feign to know him
for such a one as he is given us of God his father. Now the Gospel shows
wherefore he is come, what his office is, the benefits that we receive by
him, and what his power is toward us. And therefore if we have not the pure
and single doctrine, wherein our Lord Jesus Christ was manifested unto us:
surely we have nothing at all: and whenever we have once bin instructed in
it, we must hold it still too the last pushe. For if we swerve never so
little from it, there will be nothing but unfaithfulness in us. And in good
sooth it stands us on hand to bethink us of the horrible fall whereunto we
were tumbled with others, when we were plunged in so many errors, trumperyes,
and Illusions of Satan, that Jesus Christ was utterly unknown too us. Seeing
that God has now of his own infinite goodness plucked us out of such a
bottomless gulf: let us settle our selves too have a constant and fast faith,
that we be no more shaken like Reeds with every wind, but abide fast in the
root of the Gospel, grounded upon the invincible power of our Lord Jesus
Christ. And again, seeing that in him all Gods promises are yea, 2. Co. 1. d.
20
and Amen, and have their truth in him, so as they be performed there: let our
faith also abide steadfast there. This is it that we have to remember in this
saying of S. Paul's. Furthermore to put the Galathians to the greater shame,
he sets before them their calling by grace. These words, from him that
has called you, may be referred as well too Jesus Christ, as too GOD the
Father: for there is no great difference in the matter.

But in the mean time we see in effect what Saint Paul meant too say.
Therefore he casts the Galathians in the teeth with their lewdness, in that
they had so much the less excuse of their shrinking aside after that sort,
considering the goodness that God had showed upon them. For if God call us,
although it were too summon us too our confusion, yet ought we too obey him,
because we be his creatures. It becomes us to be subject too his
authority, and howsoever he dispose of us, it is always our duty too say,
behold Lord I am at thy pleasure: so that too use any shrinking away when God
calls us, is an utter perverting of all order. Much more when God not only
calls us unto him, but also sets all the treasures of his goodness
before us in our Lord Jesus Christ, and shows that he seeks nothing else
but too make us his own by gyuing himself so wyllingly unto us, when God (I
say) uses such bountifulness toward us as ought too rauishe all our wits
unto woondering: must we not needs be too too lazy if we shrink back?
Moreover, if we fortune too wander too and fro after we be once come unto
him, we shall have so much the less excuce, and feel the sorer and horribler
condemnation, as I have touched already. Now then we see what is imported in
this saying where Saint Paul makes mention of the grace that the Galathians
had bin called too. And out of doubt we in these days are much more blame
worthy than the fathers that lived under the law, if we continue not in the
pure doctrine of the Gospel, without turning aside from the things that are
contained therein. For albeeit that God called the Fathers too salvation under
the law as well [as us now:] yet was not that calling with so open and
abundant vtteraunce of the riches of his mercy, as we have it in our Lord
Jesus Christ. Therefore let us look well about us, and seeing he has
already made us too feel his grace: let the same stir us up and inflame us
too be the bolder too have an invincible courage too continue in the same
calling, until we be come too the place wherevntoo God allureth us. So then,
if we compare our selves with the great number of misbeleeuing and ignorant
souls, it is certain that our unthankfulness will be so much the greater, as
Gods grace has showed it self larger and deepelier unto us. We shall see
many silly souls straying here and there, and yet cease they not for all
that too be subject too damnation. For he that has offended without law, Romans
2. b. 12
shall perish without Law. Now for as much as God has declared his will so
freendly unto us, and that together with the use of discretion we have also
the doctrine of his Gospel, which (as I have said heretofore) serves too show
us that our damnation shall be more horrible if we labor not too dedicate
ourselves wholly unto him, by means whereof our bond becomes so much the
streighter: S. Paul adds another circumstance, which is that it came too
pass very hastily. For certesse it was a horrible thing, that the Galathians
having bin taught by the holy Apostles own mouth, should be so corrupted as
long as he was alive. Ye see then how it was the more too their blame, that
within three [or foure] days after their receiving of the Gospel, they were
fleeted away and had mingled many false opinions with the truth of God. But
although they had continued in the truth some good while after Paul's decease:
yet does it not follow that their so doing might have bin a sufficient
discharge for them, if they had fallen away afterward. For as the truth
whereupon our faith rests is everlasting, although both heaven and earth
do pass away: so must our faith hold out too the end, and not hang either
upon the life or upon the death of any man, Luke. 21. f. 33.
but have her ankerhold fastened in heaven. Therefore if we change [at any
time,] whither it be to day or too morrow, we shall be the more too blame,
and our unthankfulness shall be so much the shamefuller. And truly the thing
that S. Paul sets down here in the person of the Galathians, is seen
now adays too much. For such as have gotten some smattering of the Gospel,
will be weary of it within a two or three years, if there come no new
change in the mean time. For they have itchyng ears, and we see many
fantastical persons become backesliders: and because the truth of the Gospel
likes them not, they would always be fleeting, and have I wot not what new
stuff brougtht in, too feed them in their fond speculations. We see
othersome grieved, because they perceive that the Gospel aduauntageth them not
too the worldward: yea and there are some that turn away, because they see it
is an occasion too make them too be persecuted, and too purchase them many
enemies, or else they starve (as they think) whiles other men prosper and fare
well. Thus ye see how Jesus Christ is forsaken of many, howbeit not from the
father too the son, but by reason that such as have showed him a fair
countenance, are suddenly changed and fleet away from him within a two or
three years, or at leastwyze within half a score years after. So much the
more then ought we too mark well this doctrine, because it is spoken too us:
and also too think upon the reproach which Jeremy laid unto the Jews. Go
your ways intoo far Countries (says he) run beyond sea, Ierem. 2. c. 10.
see what other people do: every man keeps him too his own Idolles, and yet
there is no Godhead in them: Satan beguyles them under color of devotion, and
they be so settled in the same, as they cannot by any means be turned away
from it. Now at leastwyze be you as constant as they, seeing that God has
showed himself too you, and you know his will fully and certainly. Let us
beware that the like be not said too us now adays: for we see the
ouerearnestnesse of the Turks [in their Religion]. And although the Jews be
no better than unclean Dogs, yet are they stiff still in maynteyning the
authority of their Law. As for the Papists, they have nothing but dotages,
so beastly as it is horrible too see: even children are able too judge of them:
and yet for all that, we see how they burn with furious zeal too maynteyne
their treacheries. But as for us, the Devil does no sooner hold up his
finger, but by and by we gad after him: it should seem that every of us
watches too spy if there come any new toy, and the least occasion in the
world will by and by shake us and scare us out of our way: and thereof we fee
too many examples, even here without going any further. So much the more
therefore does it behoue us too mark the blame that is laid here by the mouth
of Saint Paul, against the inconstancy of such as turn away from God,
specially so soon after he had called them to the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ. And therevppon S. Paul says, that it is nothing else but that there
be some among them which trouble them, and would overthrow the Gospel of our
Lord Jesus Christ. Here S. Paul shows, that what soever men bring besides
the Gospel, is every whit of it but stark smoke, and that in the end it will
be perceived that the Devil did cast gewgawes in their ways, too cousen
silly fools that could not rest wholly upon Gods truth. It is none other
thing (says he) but that some trouble you. Truly this word Other imports
that it is nothing else or nothing at all. Nevertheless Saint Paul
declares, that the Galathians may well pretend, that they which came from
Jerusalem and from the country of Iewrie, had told them that they ought not
too separate the Law from the Gospel. No, no, (says he) there is no more
but one Jesus Christ, another is there any more than one doctrine that leads
us unto him, and holds us in the faith, where through we obtain salvation
by his means. So then all such as intend too cleave unto the pure knowledge
of the Gospel, and to continue in the same, must not seek any other
perfection [than that]: as for them that go any further, they be troublers that
overthrow and disorder all things. And this saying is well worthy too be
marked, too the end we may know that when our Lord has done us the grace
too teach us in his school, we must no more have a wavering faith too reele
too and fro, but a resolute judgment and determination too say, this is the
thing wherein we must live and die. But ye shall see many that will not speak
openly against the doctrine of the Gospel, but will suffer the grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ too be preached. If a man ask them what it is that they
find fault with: nothing, say they. But let an Altar be never so soon set
up, and puppets upon it, and by and by they run to it, they must needs go
hear Mass and see all the rest of the Popish trash, they care not which way
the world go, and when all those disorders are set before them, they think not
that there is any difference at all. But let us mark that such beastliness
bewrays that there is no faith in them. And why? For, the thing wherein we
may show, yea and (as in respect of our selves) feel, whither we be
faithful, is too have such skill of the Gospel, as to conclude that it is
Gods infallible truth, and that it cannot lead us amiss if we follow it.
Contrarywize the Papists have deuized an Implicate faith (as they term it)
and that is enough for them: and although the wretched souls wot not what
they mean themselves, yet notwithstanding, behold (say they) I refer my
self too our mother the holy Church, I believe as she believes. But such
folk show openly, that they have no faith at all, ne know by what means too
be saved. Nevertheless it is said that we obtain righteousness and
salvation by faith, namely for that we embrace Christ as the party by whom
all good things are imparted unto us. Then if our Lord Jesus Christ be
unknown, it is no longer faith, but a gross Illusion of Satan, who has
bewitched the Popish doctors too speak after that sort: and thereby we see
that they have no knowledge of God, but are utterly given over too a lewd
mind. Wherefore let us mark well, that whereas S. Paul says here, that
there is none other Gospel: it is too hold us still in such steadfastness,
that after we have once learned what our Lord Jesus Christ is, we may continue
in him, and utterly give over all things that are contrary too the doctrine of
the Gospel. Have we once such skill, it will serve us too fight against Satan
and all the diversity of opinions that are at this day in the world, so as
we shall not be shaken down what trouble soever happen, nor finally be
turned aside from the certainty of our faith. But if we waver after such a
sort that we become like little children, who if one man offer them an apple
at one side they run thither, and if another man offer some other pleasant
thing atother side they run thither likewize, and leaving the first go too
yield themselves too the second. I say if we be so fickle minded, it is a
token that there is nothing but mere unbelief in us. Then let us assure our
selves, that there must be such a mutual agreement between our faith and the
Gospel, that we must give our selves wholly thereunto, and never be plucked
from it, and our knowing of the things that are contained in it, must be too
rest our selves upon them, as I have said already heretofore. Not that all men
can be teachers a like (for it is very certain that the most part of those
whom our Lord Jesus Christ has in his flock, comprehend not the tenth part of
the understanding of the holy Scripture) but that how soever the world go, it
behooves us all to be grounded in these points, namely that there is but one
God the father, of whom we have al things, and who has adopted us of his own
mere mercy: That there is but one only Jesus Christ, by whose means we be
made parttakers of all good things: And that we be begotten new again by the
holy Ghost: And as touching our Lord Jesus Christ, it stands us on hand too
be well assured that he is our advocate, and that without him we cannot come
unto God, nor durst once open our mouths to call him our father, save in
respect that we be members of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that he bears word
for us as our spokesman and patron, guyding us as it were by the hand, too
bring us unto God his father. If we know not these things, it is certain
that we can obtain no Salvation. And that is the cause why S. Paul blames
the Galathians, for that they considered not that there is but one only
Gospel, which could not be altered without doing of wrong too our Lord Jesus
Christ, who all only ought too have all audience. Therewithal also he
warns us, that when soever there come any busy bodies to turn us from the
pure simplicity which we ought too hold us too concerning God and our Lord
Jesus Christ: we ought too hold them accursed. For (as shall be said more
fully hereafter) they overthrow the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. And it is
a right horrible thing, that the Gospel which is the foundation of our faith
and the key too open us the gate of Paradise, should be overthrown. For that
is all our welfare, that is the kingdom of God from whence we (after a sort)
are banished: and we can by no means come unto him, until he have made us
way by means of his Gospel, to the end we may be his people and he our king,
and we be guided and governed by his authority. Ye see then that the
inestimable benefits which are comprehended in the Gospel, are these: namely
that men are reconciled unto God: that the gate of Paradise is opened unto us:
and that our Lord Jesus Christ is given us for our heritage, so as we be made
pattakers of all the benefits that he has powered upon us, and that he has
warranted our endless Salvation. Now, were it not better that the whole world
should sink and perish, than that all this should be overthrown? That
therefore is the cause why S. Paul tells us, that all such as come too set
troubles after we have bin faithfully taught, and that all such as bring in any
curiosities or foyst in this or that of their own brain, do turn men away
from the kingdom of God and from his royal seat, too the intent that they
should not any more be governed by him, nor the Scepter of our Lord Jesus
Christ be any more lifted up among them too their salvation. Now if we set so
much store by Gods honor as we ought to do, or esteem it a precious thing
too be parttakers of all heavenly benefits, or if we make account of our
own welfare: ought not every of us too shun those troublers, and too cast
them out as deadly plagues of the world, when they come among us and fall too
abolishing of the whole Majesty of God, and of the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and consequently of our salvation also? Thus ye see in effect, that
the thing which we have too mark here, is that we must stick with so
earnest a mind to the Gospel, as we may not suffer our selves too be thrust
out of the way by any means, nor abide that any man should trouble our wits,
by bringing in any new thing more than was before. Although the men be never so
skillful, subtle, sharpwitted and eloquent: yet let us shake it off every wit
as accursed, if it go about to turn us from the pureness of the Gospel. That
is the thing which Saint Paul teaches us here. And when he has spoken so,
he adds, that if he himself, or an Angel came too preach any other Gospel
than that which the Galathians had heard and understood, they should shake
them off, hold them as accursed, excommunicate them, and take them too be as
Diuelles. Here we see that S. Paul is (as ye would say) whote to maintain
the steadfastness of the faith, to the intent we should not by any means be
shaken from it, and that is not without cause. For we see what frayltie is in
us, and not only frayltie but also fondness and rebelliousnesse, which are yet
worse. At the first blush, if a man teach us Gods word, and that we be not
touched with it in good earnest: 2. Cor. 2. d. 14.
we will think it the straungest thing in the world: for the doctrine will
always seem foolish too man's wit, as we have seen heretofore. And what is
the reason? Even our fondness, because our wits are wandering and rouing,
and we be naturally bent and foreward too leasing, and desire (as it were
wilfully) too be beguyled. Now then seeing that our wits are so marred, it is
no marvel though we like not the word of God, or though it have no entrance
intoo us, for all our lustiness is but rebelliousnesse, and whereas we think
our selves to have reason, we be stark blind: and to be short it is not for
naught that the scripture says, that men are nothing but vanity and leasing,
yea and rebels too God, so as they draw always back from that whereunto God
calls them. But put the case that God had done so much for us as too draw us
too him, and to make us taste that his truth is the thing whereunto it behooves
us too hold our selves, and that we were so tamed that there were no more
wilfulness in us, but that we were ready to yield him all obedience: yet is
there such a fraylnesse and inconstancy in us, that the Devil shall easily
thrust us out of the way every minute of an hour. And hereof we see
experience even in those that had bin as mirrours of holiness, so as ye would
wonder to see them suddenly changed and gone from the right way. And what is
the cause of it? As I said before, although we be in a good forewardnesse, yet
can we not hold our own long, but that we shall by and by go clean awrie,
except God work in us and amend our frayltie. Thus ye see why S. Paul does
with such majesty maintain the doctrine of the Gospel and the occasion
thereof was given him by the Galathians, for they were thrust out of the way, by
reazon that they were borne in hand, that it behooved them too keep the
ceremonies of the law. S. Paul therefore beholding such an example and image
of men's infirmity and over great lightness, says that the belief of the
Gospel must surmount all that we can conceive, and that we must not be
removed from it, another by the knowledge, nor by the great cunning, nor by the
eloquence of men, in so much that even though the Angels of heaven should
deal with us in that case, we should take them too be but Diuelles. But
how soever the case stands, this were very strange. What? The Angels of
heaven? And again, what is it that Saint Paul speaks of? His own
preaching. He fayeth not singly the Gospel of Christ, but the Gospel which
I have preached unto you. And ought that too have pre-eminence above all the
Angels of heaven? First and formest we see, that it is too no purpose too
magnify the doctrine of the Gospel in general and vndistinct terms: but we
must also therewithal be sure which is the same doctrine. To be short, there
are many among us that can well enough mock at the fondness of the Papists:
but if a man poze the^ in the principles which even young children ought too
know perfectly, they can no skill of them: and so that one of them be talking
of one man and another of an other, all is one too them, they have no
discretion, they make such a hotchpotch of the matter, as if a man should
iumble salt and water and mustarde and very we all together. Ye see then
that they can well enough confess in general terms that the Gospel ought
too be preached, but in the mean while they know not what the Gospel is.
Now too correct such faults, S. Paul says Namely the Gospel that I have
preached unto you. And hereby (as I said) he shows us that we ought too
know, what substance is contained in the doctrine that is set forth unto us in
the name of God, to the intent that our faith may be fully settled upon it, so
as we may not be fickle minded to be tossed with every wind, nor go at all
adventure too alter our purpose an hundred times a day, but that we may stand
out too the end. This is in effect the thing that we have too bear in mind.
But by the way, it ought too make Paul's doctrine of the more authority, that
he speaks so boldly in the mayntenance of it, and that not through humane
rashness and presumption, but in the name of God. For in very deed he
stands not here upon the praising of himself in his own person: and that
does he show right well in that he says, If I my self. He sets himself
foremost, as if he had said, Let me, even me my self I say be taken for a
Devil, if I change the doctrine, or if you find me to have swarued in any
manner of wize. Here S. Paul shows that he meant not too purchase reputation
too himself, ne fought in his own quarrel, to have it said of him that he was
a fineheaded fellow, or a wyze and excellent man: no, but he raungeth himself
in array with the faithful, and says, let us all embrace the doctrine of that
Master too whose charge God has committed us, and unto whose government we
ought too be submitted. For although I be he that taught you the doctrine:
yet is it not mine, but Gods who is unchangeable: and although ye should see
me change, yet be not you removed nor abashed for it, but esteem me as a
Devil, hold me accursed, and for your own parts continue you still settled in
the truth which you have learned, and as for me, curse you me, and ban you
me, yea and the very Angels of heaven too, rather than too change any whit
of the truth of Gods Son, or too turn aside from it. Here we see well
enough, that S. Paul sought not aught else, but that Gods truth might have
such reverence among men as it deserves, and be so received, as all our
wits, all our thoughts, all our lusts, and all our affections might be
subdued and hilde prisoners under it, and that it might not be lawful for any
living creature to change aught thereof, but that God only might speak by the
mouth of his only Son, and we hold him for our Master, yea and every of us
obey him without gaynsaying. That is the thing which S. Paul sought. How beit
for as much as we cannot now lay forth the rest, it shall be reserved till the
next Sunday if it please God.

Now let us fall down before the Majesty of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him too make us perceive them more and more, and that
the feeling of them may draw us too right repentance, and cause us too grow
and increace in faith, so as we may be true sacrifizes too him: that like as
our Lord Jesus offered himself for our redemption, so we also may bethink us
too dedicate our selves wholly unto him, and be guyded by him in such
steadfastness, that another in life nor death we may not seek any other
contentation and rest, than too apply our selves too his good will, nor glory
in any other thing than in the Salvation that is purchaced for us in him. That
it may please him too grant this grace, not only to us but also too all people
and nations of the earth, etc.

The. 4. Sermon upon the first Chapter.
8 But if I my self or an Angel from heaven tell you otherwise than I have
told you, cursed be he.

9 As I said before, so say I yet again, if any man tell you othervvize than
you have received, cursed be he, etc.


We have seen heretofore that we must be sure of the truth of the Gospel, or
else our faith is no faith but rather an opinion, if we be ready to stagger too
and fro. Now then the very proof which we ought to make of our faith, is to
be fully settled and resolved in our selves that God has taught us, and that
he has so uttered his will unto us, that if we swerve from it one way or
other, it is all one as if we did wilfully cast our selves away. And for this
cause we must not only receive Gods word as good and holy: but also bear
such honor too it, as to hate whatsoever is against it, yea or which agrees
not fully with it. For when as S. Paul speaks here of an other Gospel: his
meaning is, that if men disguyze the pure simplicity which they have learned
of him, there remains nothing else but untruth and corruption. Wherefore let
us learn to set such store by Gods doctrine, that we may not only esteem it
in it self, but also reject as devilish things, what soever shall be brought
contrary or repugnant unto it. And truly Saint Paul thinks it not enough
too speak of men, but mounteth even unto the Angels of Heaven, and says
that we must rather hold them accursed, than alter any whit of the faith
which we have of the Gospel. He does well too speak of himself first: and
he does that, too show that he had no regard of his own person, but that he
meant simply too honor God, and too cause his word to be received of all the
world without gaynsaying. Therefore it was needful that Saint Paul should
use that protestation: for if any man exempt his own doctrine by privilege,
he makes the same a private case. But he that teaches, ought too raunge
himself in the common array and too submit himself obediently too the Gospel
of our Lord Jesus Christ, so as we may not have any other Master in this
world of whom too hold our faith, but that the Son of God may have all
soueraintie over us as belongs unto him. And Saint Paul speaks purposely
of the Angels, because the false Apostles and deceyuers that were come intoo
the country of Galatia, pretended the name of Peter, John, and James: and
therefore he sets a bar in their way, saying that when they had all that
could be on their side, yea and that the whole world took part with them,
all that was nothing. Moreover though they had the very Angels of heaven with
them, yet should God nevertheless over rule the^ by his word, and all
creatures be thrust down. For if any thing lift up it self against Gods truth,
wherein his image shines forth and his majesty and glory ought to be known:
the same ought also to be condemned, and to be hild as accursed. It might
perchance seem at the first blush, that S. Paul used an excessive fashion.
For too what purpose brings he in the Angels, seeing we know how they be
wholly given too do Gods will? Psalm. 103. d. 20.
According as it is said expressly in the. 103. Psalm, and as we see moreover
through the whole holy Scripture, that they have not any other regard, than
simply to obey God. Seeing then that it is impossible that the Angels should
falsify the pure truth: Saint Paul should not have brought them in. Yea it
might be thought that he does them wrong and injury, considering that God
has given them the grace too abide in his obedience, and too walk quietly as
he has appointed them. But it is not without cause that Saint Paul speaks
so, for as much as the Devil does always indeuer too bring the things that may
be well liked of, to overthrow the pure doctrine withal. And we see, how
that even Gods name has at all times bin pretended by deceyuers, and although
they brought nothing but illusions and mockeries, yet not withstanding they
protested with full mouth, that they were sent of God. By reason whereof, the
Prophets had much ado in fighting against such as labored to abuse the world
under such covert, [in so much that] they were feign too come to the trial,
to know whither God spoke by their mouth or no. And we know also how Saint
Peter says, 2. Pet. 2. a. 1
that like as among the people of old time there were many deceyuers which
troubled the Church and brought all things in a broyle: so we also in these
days must look too have underlings of Satan's, which shall labor too sow
darnell among us, and the Church must still be subject too the same
inconvenience, because God intends too bewray and try whither we be his in
truth or no. For the Hypocrites will soon be shaken down, when they find
occasion to change. They be so light headed and fleeting, that they must
needs be trotting too and fro. But Gods children which have taken lively and
deep root in the Gospel, will never be removed. And therefore does God also
give bridle to Satan, who rayzeth up false Prophets as it is said in the
thirtenth chapter of Deuteronomie, Deuteronomy. 13. a. 3*
because God intends too know by experience, whither we love him or no, that
is too say, whither we bear him the honor that he deserves, by resting upon
him, yea and by resting upon him with a true and unchangeable constancy. Now
seeing that the Devil has in such wise troubled the Church, and so sown his
errors as he has taken covert under the name of God: it behooves for the
mayntayning of that point and article, that Gods word abide in his full and
perfect state. For when the Paynims worshipped their Idols, they always abused
the name of God, and all that they did was Religion as they termed it, and (to
their own seeming) there was none other holiness in the world, but the
following of their fond devices. But contrariwise the holy Scripture tells
us, that all their Gods were but Devils. And what agreement is there between
those two sayings? Yea, but for as much as the thing that the Heathen men took
in hand, was but a masking to vnhalow the name of God, and to convey it over to
their Idolles: therefore it is requisite that that fond opinion should be cut
of. And we see at this day how the Pope and all the filthy puddle of his
Clergy, do bear us in hand that they be Christ's vicares, and that they
represent the Church, and are the successors of the Apostles. All this geere
must be beaten down, or else we shall never know what faith we ought to
stick unto. Ye see the^ after what manner S. Paul alleges here the Angels.
As if he should say, what soever authority of men be alleged, it cannot in
any wise prejudice God or his word. For his word must have the upper hand, and
all high and excellent things in this world must stoop and be brought low: and
not only the mortal creatures, but eue^ the Angels also, in so much that if it
could come to pass (which thing is impossible) that an Angel should set
himself against God, he ought to be abhorred. And let us not think that the
Angels are wronged herein. For what is all their glory and dignity? It is too
do seruis to their Maker, and to our Lord Jesus Christ, who is their head as
well as ours. So then, if a man make bold with their name too the end that
Jesus Christ be glorified, and that his Gospel may abide in perfect
soundness vnappayred: therein the Angels are willing too yield, so their
name serve to such use, for that is their chief desire. Thus ye see why
Saint Paul makes bold with the name of the Angels, although he meene not
that they can at any time shrink from their obedience unto God. And he
repeteth the same sentence again, saying, that who soever shall bring any new
Gospel, let him be bilde as accursed. Now first of all we see here, how
God intends too be honored and served at our hands: namely not with
strange Ceremonies and fashions as men are wont too do: but our chief
seruis is to harken unto him, and as ye would say to bridle our selves, holding
all our senses prisoners under his word when he speaks unto us, according
also as he himself protests in his prophet Jeremy. Ierem. 7. c. 22.
Have I (says he) demanded Sacrifize of thy fathers? No, but the thing that I
required of them, and which I still require of you as the homage that you owe
unto me, is that you harken to my voice. In that text God shows, that men may
well ouerlabour themselves in bringing their own devotions to him upon hope to
please him thereby, but all shall be but filthiness, till we have learned to
harken to his voice, and to obey him. Mark well this point which is very
notable, least we labor in vain as we see the wretched Papists do. For it
has always bin a common disease in the world, that men knowing well that they
were created to serve God, have tormented themselves and taken much pain [to
do it,] and yet all has bin vain and vnauaylable, because they began not at
the right point of ruling their life by the will of God, and of settling
themselves fully to take nothing in hand but that which he commanded them.
Ye see then that the means too have our seruis acceptable unto God at this
day, is too give ear unto him, too suffer ourselves to be taught by his word,
to be governed altogether thereby, and to frame our life with all our deeds and
thoughts fully according to the same. And herein we see the benefit that God
has given us in calling us to the knowledge of his Gospel. On the otherside,
we see (as I said before) how the poor Papists rise early, and busy
themselves about this and that, without end or ceassing of their travels: and
yet in the mean while, not only the time is lost, and their labor is vain and
unprofitable, but also they themselves are abominable before God. Then seying
the case stands so: let us make account of the grace that God has granted
us in declaring his will unto us, and let us understand that we must not walk
at adventure, but discern between good and evil, howbeit not after our own
wit and imaginacio^, but by going to Gods school, and by learning the things
that he allows, assuring our selves that nothing deserves too be esteemed,
save the framing of our selves to the rule which he has given us by his word.
Mark that for a principle. And herewithall we see also what the majesty of
the Gospel is, and that it is not for us to bring in men's opinions in that
case to wrap our selves in any doubt as the Papists do now adays, who have
none other buckler against us, but the traditions of the Church, Councels, and
Antiquity. Howbeit when they have thronged all the world together, will it be
able to counteruayle the Angels of heaven? No certainly. Now then we may well
mock at their foolishness after the example of S. Paul, and say that if the
Pope and all the rabble of his stinking Clergy had the Angels on their side,
it were nothing at all in comparison of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has all
sovereign power, and before whom all knees ought to bow, not only of mortal
creatures, but also even of things that are aloft in heaven, according as it is
said in the Epistle to the Philippians, Phil 2. b. 10 and Esa. 45. d. 23.
where this saying is applied to his person, in that God swears that al knees
shall bow before him, and all tunges confess that he only is to be glorified.
Ye see then that the way for us to commend the doctrine of the Gospel, is to
abide unremoved by the authority of men, and (when it is told us that such a
one is of this opinion or that,) to assure our selves that seeing God has given
us the grace to be fully resolved in our minds, it behooves us to hold us
always to it without changing. This is in effect the thing that we have to
consider in this sentence: Now herevpo^ S. Paul shows, how it was not
without cause that he speak so of his Gospel that he had preached. For he
says that he teaches not after the manner of men, or that he does not set
forth men, nor counsel [them] after the manner of men, but that he sets
forth God, and seeks not to please me^, but Jesus Christ. Afterward he
adds, that his Gospel is not of men, but that it was reveled to him from
above, as I have declared already. It had not bin enough for S. Paul to have
spoken of the Gospel in general, except he had showed therewith, that he had
bin a true and faithful minister of it. For the Devil ca^ well enough away,
that the name of the Gospel should be of very great estimacion among us: but
in the mean while he would not have us to know what it means, nor cease to
be inta^gled in store of errors, and to have our wits rouing here and there.
Then it is not enough, that the name of the Gospel be honored in the world:
but we must also know what manner of thing the Gospel is, and what is contained
in it. And that is the cause why S. Paul chalendgeth that faithfulness of
teaching the Gospel, in so much that if any whit of it be changed, let the
same be accursed. And this yet again is well worthy to be noted. For when the
Papists read this place, they do nothing but skoffe at it: and God also has
dulled them, so as there is less wit in them, than in little children. For
they understand it [thus: namely] that Paul meant, that if a man should make
another Gospel, as if a man should write a book, and the same should not be
the Gospel that was written by him, then they should utterly reject it,
because the Gospel was sufficiently proved already. But in the mean while
they thought not that all that was contained in Paul's Epistles was every whit
of it Gospel: but they rather surmyzed, that he had written some story of the
Gospel, and that if any other had bin brought in upon the refuzall thereof,
the same that had bin so brought in, should have had no credit nor reputation.
But we see that in that case these wretched beasts have another reason nor
understanding, nor any taste at all. So much the more therefore does it stand
us in hand too mark, that S. Paul had good cause too speak of the Gospel
which he had preached, even to show as it were with his fingar the doctrine
which it behooves us to be fully persuaded of. Will we be of the flock of our
Lord Jesus Christ? Then is it not enough for us too accept what soever is told
us in his name: but we must put that thing in ^re which is spoken in the
tenth of Saint John, John. 10. a. 5
which is, too be able by herkening unto his voice, too discern his voice
from the voice of strangers, and too be always fully persuaded, that there
is not any other than he, too whom we ought too yield. Thus ye see how the way
to be under the guiding of our good shepherd, is that we swerve not one way nor
other when men assail us, but every of us indeuer to draw home to himself, so
as we become not like wavering reeds, but stand steadfast in the doctrine which
we shall have learned. In so doing our Lord Jesus Christ will auow us to be of
the company and number of his sheep, and always do the duty of a shepeherd
toward us. But if we play those men which care not which end go foreward, in
so much that if a man tell the^ that Jesus Christ is the only he upon whom we
must rest to have any trust of Salvation: it is well, they can like well enough
of that doctrine: and on the contrary part if a man set store of trumperie
before the^, and go about too trouble their wits with this and that, [they
can well enough away with that too] and all is one to them: if there be no
discretion in us, it is a token that we have no certainty of faith. For we
must be out of all doubt, that Jesus Christ is the only Master, seeing that
that charge is committed to him by God his father, and also that he has fully
performed the same. If we be not at that point, it is certain that we shall
always be carried away with opinion and imaginacion, and that there shall be
no faith at all in us. And that is the cause also why S. Paul declares, that
the Gospel which he had preached, is the same which our Lord Jesus Christ
commanded to be preached and published, and whereof he is the author in the
name of God his father. Seeing it is so: it behooves us to hold us to it: and so
consequently when S. Paul speaks of another Gospel, he means the
minglemangle and corruption that might be put unto it: as if he should say,
Whatsoever is added or patched to the doctrine of the Gospel by man's device,
so as they can not content themselves with the simpleness thereof, but that
they do vary from it: is every whit of it mere leasing. And therefore let us
shun it as a poison, for surely no poison can be so deadly as a false
doctrine. And if men do naturally keep themselves from the things that may
hurt this transitory life: ought not our souls to be much more precious too
us? What care ought we to have that they be not poisoned by any trumperie of
men? Too be short, let us be sure that as soon as any by matter is added
too the pure doctrine of our lord Jesus Christ, it is plain falsehod. For he
will not only he hilde as principal, but he must continue alone without any
companion, and all those that teach, must first become his scholars, so as he
that speaks in the Church set not down any thing of his own, or which has
bin coined in the warehouses of men, but show himself to be the true disciple
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and teach us all by the authority of him. Mark
that for one point. And for a second, it behooves us to know what is
contained in the Gospel. For if the word Gospel should trotte up and down
in every man's mouth, and yet in the mean while men make us believe that Chalk
is Cheese, as they say: what a thing were that? What should we be the
better for giving so honorable report too the Gospel, as to say it is Gods
pure truth, wherevntoo all creatures ought to submit themselves? It stands us
on hand too know what is the substance of it, so as we may be sure that the
son of God is come down hither to guide us unto God his father, too the
end we may understand after what manner he will be worshipped at our
hands, and furthermore be made privy too Gods will, that we may frame our
whole life thereafter, and not invent a service after our own lust and lyking,
but yield him that obedience which he requires and allows above all things.
Again, we must [learne too] know how miserable our state is, if we intend
to seek our salvation in our selves. For there is nothing in us but ignorance,
infirmity, weakness, yea and stubbornness and wicked lusts: and to be
short, we be hilde in Satan's bands, so as he draws us like silly beasts,
even as Asses and Oxen that are sold: and if we intend to be set free from so
horrible bondage, and tyranny, we must go too none but God, assuring our
selves that he is the fountain of all welfare. Furthermore forasmuch as we
cannot come unto God, but we must first come to our Lord Jesus Christ, who is
come down unto us: so as we must seek all that we have need of in his
fullness, and repose our whole trust there, and not have any other preparation,
righteousness, holiness, or perfection than him, but be utterly emptied in
our selves, and yet notwithstanding not cease too trust that he will lead us
too God his father* We must also understand by what means we be justified,
that is to wit, by the sacrifice of his death and passion. Besides this, when
we come to pray vnt God, let us resort unto him as our Advocate, that he may
bear word for us. Ye see then that the thing which we ought too know
concerning the Gospel, is that there is but one only law whereby to rule our
lives: that we must have but one certain belief, so as we know the God whom
we should serve and worship: that we behold him in the person of our Lord
Jesus Christ who is his very Image: that we must have none other thing to rest
upon than Jesus Christ: and that all our thoughts must be directed thither,
assuring our selves that in him the father has put all things requisite for our
faluation, and that he also does by the power of his holy spirit, guide and
govern us, in such wise, that being under his protection, we be sure that the
Devil and all his champions can do nothing against us, when we be so
preserved by his power. This is the contempt of the Gospel, which it behooves
us to know, or else the things that are spoken here will do us no good at al.
Furthermore S. Paul, to show that he does not without cause prefer himself
before those that went about to disguise the doctrine of the Gospel, by
thrusting in some minglings and additions: uses two arguments. The one is,
that he had behaved himself faithfully and with a pure and right meening mind
in teaching the Galathians and all other me^. The other is that he had not set
forth any thing of his own head, but had received his matters by heavenly
revelation from our Lord Jesus Christ. Now it behooves us to mark well these two
arguments, to the end we may perceive, that S. Paul has not without cause
declared heretofore, that this doctrine of his ought too be of good credit,
and that it was not lawful for any living creatur to strive against it. Hervpon
we may gather a general rule, how we ought to be sure of our faith. For the
Angels shall not come down to speak to us after a visible manner, but we must be
taught by the mouths of men. And yet for all that, (as I have said already) we
must hold this for an infallible conclusion, that we have the doctrine
whereupon our faith is grounded and settled, from God and from our Lord Jesus
Christ. And how shall we perceive that? By the two reasons that are set down
here. VVherof the one is, that such as teach us have a desire and zeal to
bring us unto god, and arm not themselves with the title and name of men, no
nor have any thing at all of man, but follow the trace which God has commanded
all his to keep, that is to wit, that they win the world unto the obedience of
him. Let that serve for one point. Secondly, besides their good zeal, they
must also have a certeintie [of doctrine] so as he that speaks may not take
any thing upon him, nor pass his bounds, but from hand to hand deliver the
thing that is commanded him, in such wise as Jesus Christ may always be heard,
and suffered to speak, and al mouths else be stopped, saving only in way of
harkening, that his doctrine may be known unto us. Now as touching the first,
where S. Paul protests his good mind: he says that he does not counsel [or
persuade] according to me^, but according to God* And hereby he meneth, that he
went not to work with a worldly affection, but had labored to apply himself
simply unto God, seeing he had bin called by him: and also that he had taken
Jesus Christ for his master, so as he laid not forth any thing but him, nor
took any backfence of me^, as those do which would allure simple and ignorant
folk unto the^, who hunt for credit here and there, saying* ho, such a man
says so. But it is only God that is to be hearkened unto. For though al me^
with one accord would turn us aside from him: surely he alone ought to outwey
ten C. M. worlds, if there were so many. Then seeing the case stands so, let
us mark well the doctrine that is contained here, where S. Paul sets down
his own affection, which serves to give us a general rule: according
whereunto he adds immediately, that he had not labored to please me^. For so
sone as folk speak after the appetite of men, Gods truth must needs be
corrupted. Also* he adds, that if he should please men, he were not the
servant of Jesus Christ. But the devil has many means and slightes to darken
Gods truth, in such wise, as it may well seem unto us that we be still with God,
and yet in the mean while we shall be a great way of from him, unless we have
wisdom and discretion as it is given us here. Therefore let us have the skill
too discern God from men, so as we may not be abashed nor amazed when we see
many contrarieties, much diversity of opinions, and many incounters and
disputations. Let none of all those things make us change our belief. And
why? Let us look no more but whether we can be sure in God: if we have that
once, let us boldly despise the whole world. But if we be not well settled
in our faith: it is certain th^^ every blaste of wind will overthrow it; or
at leastwyze make it too stagger too and fro. Therefore let us take such taste,
as we may know that God has verily had pity of us, too the end too show
us his will: and let us look well too such as teach us, [and marke] of what
mind they be led and governed, whether they seek to obey God on their own
part, and too lead us in the same way by their own example. Furthermore, when
S. Paul says, that if he should please men he were not the servant of Jesus
Christ: that doctrine implies very much. For we know well enough what men
are of their own nature, how there is nothing in them but iniquity and
stubbornness against God. Then if we mind to pleasure them: we must give over
God and have nothing to do with him. For men go always backwarde if they be
not compelled to come unto God, and they kick against him like wild beasts.
Therefore we cannot please them but by straying from God, and by giving the
bridle to such as leap out, eft a tone side, and eft a toother: yea and even
the good men could sometimes find in their hearts, that God should apply
himself too their appetites. For although they be still minded too serve him:
yet are they not at all times, and in all points so well ruled, as to have
given over all their own opinions, lykings, and desires, but that sometimes
they shall every one of them be tempted to do one thing or other, insomuch
that if we were not hilde short, and made to retire out of hand, we would
run to our destruction. To be short, there is none of us all but he would
be pleased, insomuch that if they which have the charge to build and teach
the Church, would please men: they should be feign too renounce our Lord
Jesus Christ. And hereby all Ministers of Gods word are taught to shet their
eyes when they intend to discharge their duty faithfully, so as they must
not look aside too regard men according to their disordered desires which
they see, but set aside all desire of their good lyking and favor. And if
they purpose to lead those unto God which would else be stubborn hearted:
whatsoever come of it let them so deal, that God may have his right, and that
our Lord Jesus Christ may have his authority. For (as I have said already)
what is too be done when we speak in his name? We must not only generally
condemn all that is of our own nature, but also so ransacke men's consciences,
as every of them may feel that God executes his jurisdiction there, and that
the Gospel is not only a launcing iron to prick, but also a sword that
pearceth to the marye of the bones, as the Apostle says in the Epistle too the
Hebrews. Heb. 4. c. 12
There must then be neither thought nor affection, which the Gospel must not
search. Truly it cannot be but that they which are so wounded, must needs
groan and have some grief and hartbyting. But yet must we shet our eyes at
all that, and not regard what men covet or desire, but pass on still forward.
Furthermore, this warning serves not only for the Ministers of Gods word,
but for all men ingenerall. Therefore if we desire too be Christians, let us
learn to do so much honor to the son of God, that although his word be
not very well too our lyking, nor we find favor in it according to our
natural wit: yet notwithstanding we may not cease too receive it
obediently. And so when any man comes to a Sermon, let him first and
foremost make his reckening to be rebuked as meet is, and let him understand
that it is for his profit that he is not soothed. And if he have itching
ears, let him lay them away from him, assuring himself that else he is
forclosed, so as he shall never receive the doctrine to his profit and
instruction. Wherefore let us all suffer our sores too be rubbed, and our
selves to be condemned, and too be dealt with clean contrary to our lyking.
Thus ye see how every of us ought to be prepared, if we purpose to be
scholars too the son of God, and to yield him the maystrie which belongs
unto him. And we ought too endeuer this thing so much the more, forasmuch as
we see our nature drives us to the contrary way. For we be blinded with
selfeloue, and every of us coueteth too be honored: but honored we cannot
be, but by flattery and lying. For who is he among us that deserves to be
commended? There is nothing but filthiness and infection in us before God. For
all the goodly virtues which we have to outward show, are but corruption till
God have reformed us. So then it is certain, that all that ever we have of our
own nature must be cleansed, or else we shall rotte in our own wretchedness.
And therefore forasmuch as there is none other mean to draw us to salvation,
but by clensing us of all our vices, and the same clensing cannot be done but
by violence: when we be warned by the doctrine of the Gospel, so as our own
consciences rebuke us, although we like well to be now and then flattered and
soothed, yet let us seek to be spoken unto earnestly, and to have our faults
told us, and to be made ashamed of them, and too have our unhonesty
discovered, and not desire to be pleased: for it were the next way to make us
rotte in our own naughtiness if we should hold it so in secret: and it
would cost us dearly the setting on, if we should be so flattered by men, and
in the mean season, the heavenly Judge should thunder down upon us. Thus ye
see how every of us ought too profit himself by that which S. Paul speaks
here, namely that if the preachers gratify and please men, in so doing they
renounce God: and if they renounce him, what shall become of the rest of the
people? VVhither shall they be led but to the devil? Therefore when any man
commes to a Sermon, let him bear well in mind, that he which preaches
speaks not of his own authority, but in the behalf of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who^ God his father has appointed to be our judge. And to what end is Jesus
Christ our Judge? To the end that every of us should condemn himself, and
that having so passed condemnation, we should resort to him to be quit. Now
then if a mortal man cover my sins for some love that he bears to me: will
the heavenly Judge spare me because he spares me? Were it not better that he
which has the charge to teach me should condemn me, and show me my faults, to
the end I might be sorry for them, and learn to mislike of the thing that
would bring me to destruction? Ought not I to take the profer, while God has
his arms stretched out to receive me, and while Jesus Christ comes before
me, offering me up to God his father, as an acceptable sacrifice of sweet
savor? And so, must it not needs be that we are as good as mad and bewitched
by Satan, if we cannot abide to have our sores rubbed and bewrayed, that we may
be brought to that which is for our welfare? If a man please a sick body,
what will become of him? Shall he give him drink every minute of an hour?
Shall he give him wine whereas he should give him water? Shall he give him
Sallets? It were the next way to poison him. Too be short, it is certain that
a man does always seek his own death, when he would have men too soothe
him. But now which is the better, either that he which has the ordering of a
sick man should yield to al his desires, or that he should bridle him
notwithstanding that he chafe at it and gnash his teeth, and storm because he
may not have his own will in his desires? But it is certain that if there be
inordinate desires in sick folks, there are much more inordinate desires in
us. What would become of us the^, if they that have the charge to bear abroad
Gods word, and ought to play the physicians, had not a care to keep us from the
things which they know to be hurtful to us, and to minister the things unto us
which they know to be for our welfare? For surely if they should sooth us in
our affections, it were the way to cast us quite down. This in effect is the
thing that we have to consider, when S. Paul speaks of his affection. Now he
adds the second argument: namely that he had not his gospel of men, but by
revelation from heaven. He confirms still his matter, in that he says that
neither Peter, nor John, can have any such reverence in their own persons, as
that men should be bound to hearken too them as of themselves, for that is
reserved to God alone, and to our Lord Jesus Christ, and they must not have
any companion. Then since it is so, let us learn to look up when the case
concerns the certeintie of our faith, and let us surmount all that is in this
world, and quite and clean give over men. And though they be never so
excellent, yet let not our faith rest here beneath, nor upon any creature, but
let it be grounded upon God. The Papists will say, we be full of pride and
stateliness, for that we will be wyser than all the world. Truly if we
rested upon our own wit and weening, or upon our own opinion, it were too
great a pride. But forasmuch as we walk in humility, shrinking down from
all our own reason and wisdom, and acknowledging that we must be fools in
this world if we will obtain the wisdom of God: Seeing (I say) that we
have such a modesty and soberness in us, and attempt not too know more than
is lawful for us, but in the mean while do so magnify Gods doctrine, so
that we can defy all that is of the world: that loftiness must needs be
good, for it is the thing wherein God will be glorified. Therefore we may defy
the Crosses and Myters and Gewgaws of the world, and all the horns of the
Pope whereby he aduanceth himself against God: I say we may defy them, yea and
abhor them, as things full of filthiness and infection, whereby our mortal
enemy Satan goes about to poison us. And therewithal let us be so settled
upon Gods truth, as we may triumph over all that is against it, assuring our
selves, that our faith must get the upper hand of all that ever sets it
self against it to batter and bear it down: the which thing to do, Satan
never forgets too torment us as much as is possible. But if we be once
strengthened in our God, let us not fear that we shall be vanquished by all
his temptations: for we be sure that as long as God is on our side, we may
esteem all that shall come of creatures to be no better than smoke.

Now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him too make us feel them more and
more, till we be utterly rid of them, and that so long as we have to live in
this world, he will bear us up in our weakness, till he have remedyed it,
and we be thoroughly reformed according to the perfection of his righteousness
whereunto he calls us. And so let us all say, Almighty God our heavenly
father. etc.

The. 5. Sermon upon the first Chapter.
11 But brethren, I do you to wit, that the Gospel which was preached by me,
is not of man.

12 For I receive it not of man, neither learned I it but by the revelation of
Jesus Christ, etc.


We saw this Morning, that all such as have the charge and office to teach in
gods Church, must forget all lyking and favor of the world: for otherwise
they can never discharge their duty faithfully, considering how men do
always desire and covet too be flattered, and cannot abide to have their
faults rebuked as they ought to be. Thereupon I told you also, that every man
must rid himself of all fleshly affections, that they may become true
disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ. For so long as we shall follow our own
lusts, the gate shall be shette against us, and we shall never have any
entrance in unto the Gospel. And truly we see how the Prophet Esaias
speaks thereof. Esaias. 30. 6. 10. 11.
He says that all such as will have men to preach pleasurable things to
their lyking, do drive away God as far off from them as they can. True it is
that they will not speak after that sort. For even in the Country of Iewrie,
every man protested to serve the God that was revealed too their father
Abraham, and which had published his law by Moses. Sacrifyzes were offered in
the Temple, and there were fair shows ynowe there. Nevertheless the Prophet
concludes in one word, that men were desirous too be soothed, and fair
spoken too, and by means thereof could not suffer God too guide them, nor
give him leave too lay his yoke upon their neck. Ye see then that the means
for us to be prepared too receive the doctrine of the Gospel, and to be
edified by the same, is that we be not wedded too our own lykings, but
suffer our Lord Jesus Christ to speak the things that are expedient for our
instruction. Howbeeit besides this, we must also be as it were wounded to the
heart by the word that is preached to us, or else we shall never fare the
better for it. Heb. 4. d. 12
For (as I declared this morning) it is not without cause that the Gospel is
lykened to a sharp swoorde, and it behooves us verily too be made true
sacrifizes by renouncing all our own lusts, and all other things which God
condemns, and too endure the same patiently, too the intent too be wholly
brought back too the obeying of his will. And heerewithall we must also call
to mind what has bin treated of heretofore: that is to wit, that all men as
well great as small, must stoop, and the son of God must have the
preeminence and maysterhood, in such wise as there may be no mo Sheepherdes but
he, and we all of us be his sheep. True it is that such as have the charge
too preach the Gospel may well be called Sheepheards: howbeeit, that is not
for that they may do any thing in their own name and authority, or that the
same should impeache the superiority of the son of God. For as for me
which do speak here now, I must not bring ought of mine, nor advance my
self above others: for my speaking unto all this company is in such wise, as
my doctrine must first be applied to my self, and [afterwarde] bear sway over
all other men without any exception. For there is no highness in the world,
which can exempt it self from the subjection which all of us owe too the
son of God: according as we have seen heretofore, how it is the property
of the Gospel to bring down all the glory of the world, so as men may not
presume too set up their bristles, nor too challenge ought to themselves, but
that such as ween themselves too be most excellent, may be utterly abaced
and made nothing, and all things be made captive to the obedience of the
Gospel. And that is the cause why Saint Paul too confirm his doctrine,
declares that it came not of men, nor was learned in their schools: but that
he had it of our Lord Jesus Christ, concerning whom the father gave
commandment, that men should hear him. For that prerogative is given
peculiarly unto him, and ought not to be communicated, Math. 3. d. 17. and. 17.
5
neither to any man, nor to any Angel of heaven. Good reason it is, that men
which speak as instruments of our Lord Jesus Christ, should be heard: but
(as I told you before) that is not to impeach the authority which he has
over us. But howsoever the case stand, the certain and infallible rule to
attain to salvation, is that our Lord Jesus be the only master and teacher,
and that we be teachable to receive his word without gainesay or replying. And
Saint Paul thinks it not enough that he holds the things of Jesus Christ
which he has published: but also he utterly rejects and excludes men in
that behalf, to show that the authority of them were not sufficient to ground
and settle our faith upon. For we shall never leave staggering till we be
come unto God, and unto that person whom he has stablished as head and
chief teacher over us. Now whereas Saint Paul says that he tells it
them: it is not for that the Galathians and others had not heard the like
before: but because they had bin unthankful, so as they had bin entangled in
many errors and paltryes. Therefore he brings them back again too the
well head: as if he should say, until such time as men have full concluded
with themselves too suffer themselves too be governed simply by the pure word
of God, they shall be always in a mamering, and the Devil shall no sooner
raise up any trouble against them, but they shall be so dismayed, as they wot
not which way too turn them. For it behooves us too be first of all sure,
that as touching the doctrine whereupon our faith is settled, we hold it of
God and not of men. True it is that all men shall not have the like revelation
that Saint Paul had: but it ought too suffize us, that our Lord Jesus Christ
having ratyfied the Gospel with his own blood, and also commanded his
Apostles to publish it abroad, has given them such proof, that the doctrine
which we receive of them is of full authority, and utterly out of all doubt:
this (say I) ought to suffize to hold us as it were in prison, and too keep
us from admitting any of all the things that men can allege. But let us also
call to mind what the Apostle tells us in the first too the Hebrews: Heb.
1. a. 2.
namely that God has lastly spoken to us by the mouth of his own son, to
the intent we should have all perfection of doctrine in him. Ye see then that
the thing which we have to bear away, is that the reualation whereof Saint
Paul speaks here, shall not be common to al other men, but serves to
warrant the doctrine which we have received by his means, so as we see it is
our Lord Jesus Christ that has spoken. And whereas he excludes men after
that sort: it is to show us, that our Lord Jesus Christ does not give us some
bare entrance, as if a man should teach a child his Apcie, and afterward
send him to a better learned master: Our Lord speaks not so by halues unto
us, but in full perfection: insomuch that both in life and death, we must
always stand steadfast in the things that we receive of him, and forsake
whatsoever comes of men: for all mingling will be but corruption; as I told
you this morning. 1. Pe. 4. c. 11
And that also is the cause why he exhorts those that speak in the Church,
too hold fast continually the Majesty of God, and not too bring in ought of
their own, nor too put forth any thing which breeds of their own brain.
For in what case should we be, if men might intermeddle themselves with our
Lord Jesus Christ, and every man cast in his morsel and coluppe (as they
say) and that we might have a Gospel stuffed with men's dreams and fancies?
It would be nothing else but a horrible confusion. Ye see then that our
Lord Jesus Christ has not his authority among us, until men be put down,
and all other creatures with them, and that all give ear unto him fro the
least too the most. This in effect is the matter which we have to bear in
mind. And in deed we see how that in another Text too the Corinthians, 1.
Co. 2. b. 6
Saint Paul declares that he had preached the perfect wisdom, when he did
set forth our Lord Jesus Christ, and that there a man shall find whatsoever
he can wish for his welfare. And in one other Text too the Ephesians he
says, Ephesians. 3. d. 18
that that is the thing wherevntoo we must apply all our study, both far
and wide, so as we need not too bring any petie trashe, too further the thing
that he had set out before. Then since it is so, we see that all such as
entangle themselves in men's devices and inventions, have a disguised Jesus
Christ, and a bastard Gospel which God disclaymeth, so that our
Christianity can be no Christianity, except we continue in the things
which we have learned of the son of God, who is our only Master, and in
the things which the Apostles also have taught us in his name. Lo what we have
too remember in this Text. Now heerevppon Saint Paul shows his own
conversation, whereby it may be gathered, that out of doubt he was as it
were fashioned by the spirit of God. For so strange an alteration as was
seen in his person, could not happen, except God had put too his hand, and
wrought after a secret and unaccustomed fashion. And so ye see in effect
whereat he amed, when he says that the Galathians knew his conversation or
manner of living. We have here a good lesson. Howbeeit, that we may profit
the more by it, let us mark how Saint Paul continues the thing that he had
touched before: which is, that a man shall not find a steadfast foundation in any
creature whereon to setle faith, but that God only must be the founder
thereof, and although men be mean, and instruments of it, yet
notwithstanding they have need too be authorized of God, and too have it
known that he has sent them and allowed them, and that they bring not any
thing which they have not received of him. Now if a man have an eye too the
virtues that were in Saint Paul, certainly he deserved well too have some
credit and audience among men. Yet notwithstanding he acknowledges and
confesses, that he is nothing as in respect of himself, and that all that
ever he has, is only to serve our Lord Jesus Christ, and to set forth the
things faithfully which he has received of him. (...)
What shall we then say too such as have neither good life, doctrine or ought
else? Whereas they call themselves Prelates, and take upon them some
stateliness and superiority, so as their sayings go for sawes: are they
therefore advanced above S. Paul? [Admit they were:] yet must all loftiness
of man cease, and be pulled down, so as nothing may hinder the exalting of
Jesus Christ. As for example, Math. 11. b. 11.
although S. John Baptist had record borne unto him that there was not an
excellenter man borne of woman: yet notwithstanding he says that both himself
and others must be diminished, John 3. d. 30.
that Jesus Christ might grow and increase. Likewise S. Paul speaking of it in
another place, Ephe. 1. d. 20.
says that the Church must in such wise be builded, as our head Jesus Christ
may always have preemi^nence. Col. 1. c. 18.
For if we should so advance men, that Jesus Christ should be defaced among
them, that were a terrible building, and such a one as should bring nothing but
ruin and confusion. And in good sooth, if a man should become as big as a
Pillar of this Church, and his head of the bigness of ones fist, so as it
should be hid between his shoulders: He should be a monster, and it were much
better for him too keep his ordinary proportion. But like as the Church is
the body of our Lord Jesus Christ: Ephesians. 1. d. 23
so must he be advanced above all men, and every man must look upon him, and
stick to him. And certesse the Papists condemn themselves at this day by
their own proverb, in that they say a man cannot know God for his Apostles.
And in very deed they have buried Jesus Christ in such sort, that he is as
good as hidden in the world. For they have robbed him of all that belonged to
him: Esa. 33. d. 22
insomuch that whereas he is called the lawgiuer, the Judge and the King, to
show that he alonely ought to bear rule: we see how me^ have decked themselves
with all those feathers. Therefore let us keep our selves from such confusion:
and if we increase, let us always abide in the root and groundwork of the
simplicity of the Gospel. Let us take good heed that we swerve not a hear
breadth from it. And as touching that which is rehearsed here concerning the
conversion of S. Paul: it tends still to this end, namely to do us to wit,
that he did not thrust himself in of his own head, but that God reached him
his hand, and that the doctrine which he had preached was given him by
revelation, so as it might safely be hilde as the word that proceeded out of
the mouth of God, and [consequently] as the certain and infallible truth. I
have told you heretofore, that if a man seek to be heard for his own skill,
for his great and deep understanding, for his fair speech, or for his great
eloquence: all those things are nothing but filthiness and dung, and that God
only must have that authority and honor at our hands: and that forasmuch as
it pleases God to speak to us by the mouth of his only son: only Jesus
Christ must have the preeminence to be the master and teacher of all his, and
we likewise must become his flock to hear his voice. Lo how our Lord Jesus
Christ is to be honored among us: namely by becoming his true scholars, and
without feyning. In the Popedom a man may well enough worship some Marmoset
with the honor of Jesus Christ, when as in the mean while the Gospel is
trodden under foot and blasphemed, and yet notwithstanding those blind wretches
think themselves too have made a fair hand. Yea, but [in very deed] it is an
open spitting in the face of our Lord Jesus Christ, when men renounce his
word wherein they should behold his glory and majesty, as Saint Paul
says in the second to the Corinthians. 2. Co. 3. b. S.
Then is it no honoring of Christ, when men make many murlimewes and
ceremonies: but when they submit themselves simply to the doctrine wherein it
is his will to be known, and wherein he shows himself unto us as it were
face to face. Thus ye see in effect what we have too bear away. And
herewithall in this conversion of Saint Paul's, we see perfectly the heavenly
power which he minded to show us here: that is to wit, that it was not of
man, but that God had uttered his arm, to the end it might be known that
such change came of him, and that S. Paul was become a new creature. For
surely it is a more excellent work of God, when a man is repaired after his
Image, than when we be borne into this transitory life. And so we see how
Saint Paul was made a new man. And that is the cause why he says expressly,
that he persecuted the Church of God, that he made havoc of all things, and
that he played the cutthrote (as ye would say,) until God had changed him, and
of a ravening woolf made him a meek sheep, and finally a shepherd in his
Church under our Lord Jesus Christ. Thus then we perceive, that S. Paul was
sent us by the hand of God, and that he brings a sure mark, so as we see he
did not thrust himself in, but that it was a work of the holy Ghost, and there
was nothing of his own coining in the doctrine that he preached, for so much as
it behooved him too have quite and clean renounced himself, to the end to give
and apply himself to the service of our Lord Jesus Christ. For had S. Paul
bin led with vainglorie, we be sure he was honored among his own
countrymen, and he could have won his spurs there. Again, if he had stood
upon the reputation of a holy life, he was unblameable. On the other side he
was at his ease and lived in rest. But it stood him on hand to have made no
more account of all the things that are to be desired to the worldward, and
which he had highly esteemed before, Phil. 3. b. 8.
than of dung and dirt, (as he himself protests to the Philippians) and it
behooved him to cast the^ al away as things hurtful, forasmuch as he saw well
how they were all of them impeachments that hindered him from coming to our
Lord Jesus Christ. S. Paul therefore not only gave over the reputation which
he had to be a great doctor, and therwithal a holy man, and as it were a little
Angel: and moreover the rest, ease and commodities of the world: but also did
before god give over all his opinion of purchasing eternal life by his own
good works. All these things he rejected as abominable, knowing well that he
was blinded with pride, in that he had imagined that any thing was auaylable
before God, or that he could purchase any favor by that mean. It behooves him
(say I) not only to have thrust all these things under foot, but also to have
abhorred them, as he himself protests. For So Much then as we see this, we be
so much the better confirmed in that which he says: namely that in executing
his office of Apostleship, he had nothing of man, nor of himself, for he had
bin quite and clean stripped out of all the things which he had made great
account of before. For in that he confesses himself to have bin a persecuter
of Gods Church, we see that to the intent to mainteyne still the honor of God,
and the authority and maisterhod of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom he served, he
does not in any wise spare himself. But behold also it behooves us to proceed
in the like case. If we purpose to employ our selves to Gods service, it
stands us on hand to forget our selves, and not to be curious in seeking the
things that are for our own behoof, or for our own honor. Until such time
then as we be come to the utter abasing of our selves, we can never give our
selves to the service of God whereunto we be called. I speak purposely of
those that have the charge to preach the Gospel, whom it behooves too be
abaced in themselves, or else they can never execute faithfully the charge that
is committed unto them. On the other side, we see how Saint Paul does not
disguise any thing, nor take any shadow or covert to be receyed among men,
but had rather reap the blame that he had deserved, and to be shamed before
men, than to cover himself with vain startingholes. For he says he had
persecuted the Church, bin a rouer and a cutthrote, and had shed innocent
blood. But yet does not this prove that Saint Paul had not indeuered to live
in holiness and perfection: Phil. 3. b. 6.
for he had bin a myrror of great vncorruptnesse. He terms himself
unblameable: and not without cause. For he says he was so blinded, that he
thought himself righteous before God, because there was not any spot in him
that could be condemned by men. Truly there was hypocrisy in him, like as
there is in all men that are not renewed by Gods spirit. When they surmyze
themselves to be well lyked of all the world: then is it certain that they
are nothing but corruption, till God have taken them into his guiding. And so
ye see that men shall be abuzed, because they stick too their mother wit in
judging what is good and evil. But contrariwise our Lord Jesus Christ tells
us, Luc. 16. d. 15
that all the things which are highly esteemed before men, are abominable
before God. Surely howsoever the case stand, S. Paul had endeavored himself to
live holily and without any blame or reproach, And yet for all that, when he was
once converted, he could not say he had done well, and that his devotion was
worthy too be allowed. But contrariwize he declares that he had bin a
persecuter, and that all this geere was nothing worth. What is too be said
then of that which now adays is called devotion and the seruis of God? (...)
As for example, in popery those terms run roundly enough in euery^mans
mouth: al things are done of good intent, all men (too their own seeming) have
affection and zeal, and they bear themselves in hand that God is much
beholden and indetted too them for the things which they do. Yea, but we
know that God has not commanded them any of the things that they bring unto
him, but every of them behaueth himself after his own fancy. How soever the
world go with them, it is but an opinion, that they ween they do well, and
that is all. One says, it seems so to me: another says, I learned it so,
and so was I taught. Now if God should allow all these things, he should have
great burdens to bear. For the things that men have invented of their own
heads, are but stinking dung before him. And yet for all this, every man
alleges this foolish brag, that he meant to serve God. But therefore it is
said in one word by the Prophet Esaias, Esaias. 1. c. 12
who has required these things at your hands? Let him that set you a work
pay you. For as for me, I will never put this geere in my reckening book: I
utterly disclayme it, because I require obedience. Now S. Paul has very well
gathered this matter. For if he had judged here of other men, it should have
had less power and force, than when he speaks of himself, and in nowise
spares himself, but says that all the holiness for which he had bin
commended among men, was but a the every, because he had bin as a mad beast,
full of fierceness and rebellion against God. Then if S. Paul make such a
plain and free confession: must not all mouths be stopped, and al of us
understand that when we thought too have served God, we were (as ye would
say) in a maze, and it was but a leading of us too the bottom of Hell? And in
good sooth, as the wretched unbelievers rack themselves, they do but double
their own condemnacion, for the Devil snarleth them so much the more in their
damnation. Therefore let us acknowledge that we have bin rebels too God ever
since the time that we would needs serve him so after our own fancy, and
that there was nothing in all our whole life, but error too make us stray all
the world over, and too pluck us back rather than too set us foreward, and
finally that all the devotions which men deuyze, are but slightes and
illusions of Satan, to sink us down too the deepest dungeons of death. So then
let us return too this obedientnesse, and acknowledge that there is no way for
us too rule our life well, but by being taught in the school of the Son of
God. But do we think that the Superstitions that reign now adays in the
world, and have their full scope there, are better than the traditions that
were in the time of S. Paul? It is true that there were many wicked
corruptions in the Church of the Jews. For Sects were sprung up, and the
Pharisees (which were yet the purest and soundest of all the rest) had mingled
many gewgawes with the seruis of God, in somuche that all was corrupted among
them. But howsoever they fared, yet Saint Paul had always the law and the
holy Scripture. As for the traditions whereof he speaks, he took them as
appurtenances: but yet in the mean while his mind was too maintain the Law
of Moses, which had Gods word in it, and the unchangeable truth, and
which ought too have the same reverence to the worlds end. Yet
notwithstanding he had but the letter of the law, as we have seen heretofore
in the Epistle too the Corinthians. 2. Cor. 3. b. 6
But now adays as for them that be the deuoutest in the Popedom, what have
they? When they have alleged all that they can, it is certain, that the holy
Scripture is as good as buried among them, and noman makes account of it. They
will not say that it ought to be cast away, for that were too great a
blasphemy, and men would abhor it. But what soever they pretend, the Gospel
is nothing with them in comparison of that which has bin ordained by their
holy Councelles, and by our moother holy Church. Yea and they are not ashamed
too say, that the Gospel and all the holy Scripture is as a noze of wax, so as
there is no certainty in it, but that it must be interpreted altogether by
men. Lo how Jesus Christ is mocked and skorned. Think ye that such men may
make us believe all their own inventions, when as they be so manifestly
contrary to themselves. Then let us mark, that if S. Paul did so condemn
himself with his own mouth [in the things that he did] when he followed not
our Lord Jesus Christ: no excuse shall be auayleable nor go for payment before
God, when men swerve aside from the simplicity of the Gospel. This is in
effect the thing that we have to gather upon his text. But let us mark
therewithal, that God uttered a singular grace in S. Paul, too the end that
by his example we might know, that our calling too salvation has bin of his
mere and undeserved goodness. And furthermore, that if we have slidde^ back,
and broken our promis made in Baptime to our Lord Jesus Christ, yet how soever
the case stand, we shall not fail to be received to mercy, so we confess
freely and without hypocrisy, that there was nothing in us but confusion, and
that God must have bin feign to remedy the matter of his wonderful goodness.
True it is (as I have touched before) that S. Paul was taken for a holy man,
and it might well have bin said, that God had accepted his devotions, and that
there had bin some good preparation in him before hand: howbeit, all that was
but a pluckyng of him back, Phil. 3. b. 8.
as I have touched already in the third too the Philippians, where he says he
could not take hold of Jesus Christ, and of the incomprehensible benefits that
are in him, until he had mislyked all the things that he had erst esteemed
and had in reputation, as his own righteousness and holiness. We see then
after what sort God wrought in the person of Paul, in so much that in the
first to Timothy, 1. Tim. 1. c. 13.
he sets forth himself for an example and pattern, saying that Jesus
Christ had showed in him, that he was come to save all wretched sinners, to the
end we should not doubt too be received when we keep the right way. What did
Frewill in S. Paul for the bringing of him to the obedience of the Gospel?
[nothing:] but God was feign too thunder down upon him from heaven, too drive
out the pride and presumption that was in him. He was not only drawn by the
hand, but also God did cast so thick scales upon his eyes, that he was as a
blind wretch. And besides that, he was stricken too the ground and
astonished, too show that the knowledge and cunning, which he thought
himself too have before, was but stark blindness, and that this darkness
had served too bring him too a new light. For if God had let him still alone
in his perfect plight, surely there would always have remained some foolish
selfeweenyng in him, and he would always have mingled some trick of his own
deuyce and brain, with the doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ: and therefore it
behooved him to be blinded and to abide so. For in as much as he had erst bin in
great reputation, and bin tempted to hold his state still: it was requisite
that he should be brought down, and lifted up again, and carried like a little
babe, or rather like a carkesse or dead body. Thus ye see how it behooved S.
Paul too be corrected after a violent manner: whereby we see that another free
will, nor devotion, nor holiness stood him in any steed, but that all ought
too be attributed to the mere mercy of God. And in very deed we see how he
yields a pure and vnconstrayned confession thereof. Then seeing it is so, let
us mark also, that when God calls us too him, it is not for that he sees us
disposed thereunto, or for that we be in any good readiness too it before
hand: but because it pleases him too draw us of his own mere mercy, as we
shall see yet more at large hereafter. And if we mind too be parttakers of the
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ as S. Paul was, the way what we must take,
is to confess that there is nothing at all in us, but that we must be feign
too receive from above, all the things whereof we be destitute, and too have
God work in us after such a sort, as the praise of our salvation may be
reserved too him alone without any exception. And in that respect also S. Paul
adds, that when it had pleazed God too call him too preach the Gospel, he
did immediately fall in train, and w^yted not at all for the advice of man,
for it was enough for him that God had sent him, and that he was auowed by
such a Master. Whereupon he did not in any wise spare himself, nor stand
scannyng of the matter, but resolved himself fully to go foreward on his way,
and to hold out in such wise as we have seen, which is a sure record that God
governed him by his holy spirit. This is the thing which we have too bear in
mind. And therwithall we must also mark well how he says, that God had
prepared him from his mothers womb, and in the end called him too publish his
Gospel. Here S. Paul shows that his calling after that manner, was not for
any forewardnesse or worthiness that was in his own person: but because he
had bin chozen of God, even before he was borne. That is the cause why he
purposely uses this saying that from his moothers womb, he had bin as it were
separated and dedicated unto God. How then could he bring any thing of his own
power? For what could he do when he was yet unborn? God therefore must needs
be the woorker in that behalf. Again, he adds that God called him. True it
is, that he speaks this concerning his office: but yet notwithstanding he
magnifieth Gods goodness in general, to show that too him only we be
beholden for all that we have, not only in respect of this flightfull life,
but specially for the everlasting salvation of our souls. This cannot be laid
out too the full at this time, and therefore we will leave a piece of it till
the next time. Howbeit for a conclusion, let us mark how S. Paul shows us
as it were in a mirror, that our yielding of our selves in obedience unto God,
happens not through any man's putting forth of himself, but through Gods
reaching out of his hand from above, and through his drawyng of us too
himself, even at such time as we could not seek him. No doubt but men will
always imagine somewhat too commend themselves withal. Neuerthelater all is
but illusion: and the Devil uses that trick to make us too darken Gods
grace, too the intent we might be bereft of it. For it is good reason that God
should leave men in such plight as they be, when they will take upon them that
which belongs unto him, and not condemn themselves as they be worthy.
Therefore let us mark well, that all the goodness which we perceive in this
world, proceeds of Gods mere grace, and that there is not any thing that can
be granted too our selves. And that we may the better perceive this free
goodness: let us understand that we must lay down all worthiness of our
own deserts, and have an eye, first too Gods free election, and afterward too
his calling. Wherefore then are we enlightened with the knowledge of the
Gospel? Is it for that we have deserved aught? No: but because God has
chozen us before we were borne, yea and even before the making of the world,
Ephesians. 1. a. 4.
as it is said in another place. Ye see then at what point we must begin, too
the end we be not puffed up with vain pride which would make us break our
necks in the end, but rather bethink us too walk in lowliness, remembering
how it is said in another place, Who is it that sholeth thee out, or that
makes thee more excellent than others? It is God (says he,) who has done it
of his own mere goodness. When S. Paul confesses there that it is God
which has separated or sholed us out: it is to cut off all allegations of men,
being well assured that no man can say he is better than his fellows, save
only because God has chozen us, yea even before we were borne. And this
choyze of God is secret, until he show by effect that he calls us too him.
And how does he that? By his Gospel: and therein there is a double grace. The
one is when the doctrine is preached too us. For we see the miserable state of
the world, how a number of silly souls, and a number of blind wretches
wander there in darkness, without succor or aid, when in the mean while our
God offers us food, yea and puts it intoo our mouths: and is not that a
singular grace? But yet further, God must be feign too call us inwardely, and
too touch us in such wise by his holy spirit, as his doctrine may rightly have
authority with us, and we acknowledge that it comes of him, and he seal the
same in our hearts by his holy Ghost, ^. Cor. 1. d. 22.
according as he speaks of it as well in the second too the Corinthians, as
also in the first to the Ephesians. To be short, according as it is said by the
Prophet Esaias, Ephesians. 1. c. 13.
that it behooves us too be taught of God: Esaias. 54. c. ^3.
Let us understand that we must be thoroughly assured in our hearts by the holy
Ghost, that the doctrine which we hold comes not of men, but is the
infallible truth of God: and we cannot but have so sure record of it, that
(if we be not to leude and unthankful,) we may perceive by eye sight, that
it is the very same whereunto we ought to stick even to the end, and also
which will bring us into the kingdom of heaven, when we shall have finished
our course in this mortal life.

But now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us perceive them more and
more, to the end that being humbled to mislike of our selves, and to renounce
all our own wicked affections and desires, we may offer our selves to our Lord
Jesus Christ, and yield him the honor that he requires at our hands, not only
for fashion sake, but also in such wise, that as he has his mouth open too
show us the way of Salvation, so we also may have our ears attentive to
submit our selves quietly unto him* and our hearts open, so as there may be
another hardness nor sturdinesse in them, but that we may abide his yoke,
being ready too receive the same, and too dedicate our whole life too the
obeying of him, and too the framing of our selves unto his holy will, that when
Gods name is so glorified in us, others may also be drawn thereunto, and all
of us be gathered into his flock, to the end we may woorship him with one
common accord, and our Lord Jesus Christ have the due honor and seruis that
belongs unto him. And for the performance hereof, it may please him to raise
up true and faithful ministers of his word, etc.

The. 6. Sermon upon the first Chapter.
15 But when it pleazed God, who choze me from my mothers womb, and called
me by his grace,

16 To reuele his Son by me, to the end I should preach him among the
Gentiles: I did not thereupon take counsel of flesh and blood:

17 Another went I back again to Jerusalem too those that had bin Apostles
before me: but went my way into Arabie, and returned again to Damasco.

18 Afterward, a three years after, I went again to Jerusalem to visit
Peter, and abode with him fiftene days, etc.


We have seen what case is handled here by S. Paul: that is to wit, that
men ought not to be advanced so high, as that the glory of God should be
defaced or diminished in respect of them, or of the reputation that we have of
their persons. For oftentimes we be given to commend creatures to much, so as
the same carries a prejudice to Gods word. And although S. Paul compare
himself here with the other Apostles: yet has he not regard of his own
person, but is desirous that the gospel which was committed unto him should be
received with all reverence. And for the bringing thereof to pass, he alleges
here Gods graces rather tha^ his own virtues. For he does not allege or
rehearce here what he had done as of himself, but what he has done through
the change that was happened vnto^ him, which men might perceive to be from
heaven, and not through his own indeuer. Yea and we see, how he declares
freely, that all his changing after that manner, ought too be fathered upon
the mere goodness of God: for he uses the term of good Pleasure. Wherein
he excludes, what soever is of man, to the end it should not be thought that
he minded too reserve aught too himself. Again, he says not that he had
sought the Gospel, but that he had had it by revelation. Thirdly he says it
was God that called him. And lastly he says that it was not for any
readiness that was in himself before hand (as peradventure a man might put one
of us too some seruis when he finds us meet for a thing:) but he says that
God had separated him aforehand from his mothers womb. We see then that S.
Paul intends not to exalt himself, but only too make Jesus Christ known by
his means, and to keep the doctrine of the Gospel from impeachment under the
color that other men had gotten great reputation through the whole world. And
(as we see) the troublers that were come into the Country of Galatia, took a
deceytfull covert under the name of the Apostles. S. Paul therefore shows,
that the thing which he hild, he had not of men. And likewise also he braggeth
not that he had conquered o^ deserved aught, but that at leastwyse it was
known how God had so set out his grace in him, as the same served to make the
doctrine of more authority which he bare abroad. But by the way, there is no
doubt, but that in the person of S. Paul, we have here a mirror of Gods
goodness, in such sort as it shows it self toward us, and whereof we be
parttakers, to the end that all men from the smallest to the greatest, should
learn to humble themselves. Therefore when we come too the knowledge of the
Gospel, although we have no such revelations as Paul had: yet
notwithstanding, this thing does always take place and has his continual
course, namely that it is not of our selves, another can men put forth
themselves to it of themselves, but all proceeds of Gods mere goodness, for
that he has so ordained. For the words that S. Paul uses, exclude all
respects that can be had, as when one man shall do another man good for some
desert, or for some other thing that he finds in his person. He does no
more here, but set down simply, that for as much as God finds no
worthiness in us, therefore when it pleases him to accept us for his
children, and to draw us too the knowledge of his Gospel, he shows that his
so doing proceeds of his own purpose and will. Thus then the thing that we
be taught here, is that faith is in such wise the mere gift of God, that
men cannot chalendge too themselves the praise of their coming too the light
of the Gospel, where their happiness and welfare lie, but ought to glorify
God, because he has bound them too him by choozing them, and calling them too
lead them thereunto: for as for the cause thereof, he seeks it in himself
and in his own mere mercy. As much is too be said of all the charges
wheraboutes God imployeth us. True it is that men chooze one another according
as they see ability in them to be put to some buzinesse: so as one is set too
rule a country, another too preach Gods word, and another too this or that. In
so doing we have an eye too the things that God has put into every man, and
it is good reason so to do. But yet for all that, how soever the case stand,
he that is so chozen, (what handsomnesse and ability soever he have too go
through with his duty) must understand that God had marked him out before* and
that he is not framed theretoo by his own policy, but that God has wrought
it in him. And therefore let us not think that he which has a better and more
foreward wit than other men, has it of himself. For whereof is it long that
we be not blockish as many creatures are, whom we see to be without wit or
reason? Who is it that has put such difference between men? It is certain
that of necessity God must have marked us out, and appointed what we should
be, even before we were borne. And therefore who soever has either wit or
any other excellent gift above other men; let him assure himself that God
has fashyoned him thereunto. Again, when we be come too age, God must be
feign too thrust us still foreward and too guide us, howbeit that the same be
by a secret power. We see that the Paynims have some care of the bringyng up
of their children, and that some of them have a better mind to their study
than others. But yet how soever they fare, it is God that guydeth and governs
them from above, so as all ought too be attributed unto him. And here ye
see why S. Paul having said that God reveled his son unto him, adds that
as he had called him too preach, so also he had erst sholed him out aforehand
from others: that is too say, he had hild him fast as he that wist well too
what seruis he were best too apply him. Then seeing it is so, we have cause too
walk in humbleness, assuring our selves that if there be any excellency in
us, we must not every man brag of it as of his own, but acknowledge God
too be the author of all that he has bestowed upon us, and that his mere
goodness is the fountain whereout of we draw. Now if this extend too the
smallest gifts of grace which we receive of him: what does it too the
inestimable benefit which he bestows upon us, when he calls us too the
knowledge of his Gospel, when he opens us the gate of Heaven, too show us
that he holds us all for his children and that he is our father, and when our
Lord Jesus Christ is so knit unto us, that by his means we be already made
sure of the endless life? Can we say that we have any thing of our own, when
God makes us parttakers of such a treasure? Ye see then that the thing which
we have too gather upon this streyne, is that God has so reserved too
himself the dispozing of man's life, that it is his peculiar office to guide
our steps: and he knows wherevntoo he has ordained us. And therefore it
becomes us too magnify his mercy, in that he has vouchsafed too inlighten
us by believing his Gospel, too the intent we might know him too be our
father, and rest upon him, and pray unto him with full trust. Let us assure
our selves, that the having of this comes not of our own freewill, but of
his touching of us too the quick by his holy spirit. For our Lord Jesus
Christ who has all wisdom in him, cannot be known of us except he be
reveled, according as he himself avouches that noman comes unto him except
the father draw him. John. 6. e. 44.
Behold, Jesus Christ was conversant in the world at that time: he preached
the Gospel and published it with open mouth: and yet notwithstanding he says
that noman shall come unto him, that is too say, noman shall frame himself too
his obedience, except the father have wrought in his heart by the power of his
holy spirit. Now that Jesus Christ is separated from us as in respect of
distance of place, and as in respect of humane nature, so as we see him not
here beneath too have any visible knowledge of him: how shall we come unto
him, if we be not drawn by the grace that is spoken of here? And if faith
be a special gift of God, and we cannot come too our Lord Jesus Christ
except we be led unto him by the hand of God his father: how can they that
should draw others do it of their own ability? Needs then must God utter
yet a second woorking. And that is the cause why Saint Paul sets down
both twain of them: that is too wit, first that he had bin enlightened
himself, and secondly that he had bin ordained and stablished as a Master and
teacher too draw othermen, to the good way of Salvation wherein God had set
him. Wherefore let us assure our selves, that God grants a singular grace
too such as have charge too preach the Gospel, when he voutchsafeth too apply
them thereunto. And that is not only too the end that we which are in that
state and office, should walk in the fear of God, and not chalendge aught too
our selves: but also too the intent that every man should in that behalf have a
record of the love that God bears too his Church. If men should thrust in
themselves on their own heads, it might be said that we were taught at all
adventure. But when as we know that noma^ is of sufficient ability too open
his mouth to speak of Jesus Christ as he ought too be spoken of, but that it
is Gods doing to send forth those of whom it behooves us to be taught: thereby
we perceive the care that he has of us, and find much better that he is our
father and has not forgotten us. And moreover this serves to ingraue the
truth of the Gospel in our hearts, to the end we may know how it is not a
doctrine that proceeds of men, but as of Gods sendyng? And that although he
be served by his creatures: yet notwithstanding he makes them as instruments
of his spirit, and it is he himself that governs them. Ye see in effect how
we may make our profit of this doctrine. But yet do we understand Gods grace
the better, in that it is said that he has chozen us and kept us too himself,
even from our moothers womb. And yet is this no let, but that he has also
moreover reserved us from before the creation of the world, according as
Saint Paul speaks in other textes: Ephesians. 1. a. 4.
howbeeit it is enough that in this place he excludes all that ever comes of
men. When a child comes out of his moothers womb, what brings he with
him? What worthiness [hath he]? Surely he is a poor carkesse full of filth
and uncleanness. Now then if God mark us out at the time when there is
nothing in us worthy too be accepted of him, or which deserves any love or
lyking: we may perceive thereby, that if he apply us too any honorable seruis
afterward, it is by reason of his own mercy, accordingly as they whom God
gathers too be of his flock, are called instruments of his goodness. Thus
ye see that the cause why Saint Paul speaks purposely of his birthe, is
too show that there was no preparation on his own behalf when God drew him,
but that God had respect too his own eternal election, the which he
continued, in that it was his will that the same creature should come into the
world, and had always guyded it too that end. Then let us assure our selves,
that when soever God bestows any of his benefits upon us, we must always
come back too this principle, namely too mount up too his everlasting purpose.
Not that we be able too comprehend how or why he has chozen us, (for that
passes all capacity of man.) But for that we must conclude, that Gods
preferring of us before those whom he leaves as of castes, is not for that he
finds us worthy or capable of such a benefit, but because he had so
ordained before he had created us and put us intoo the world, yea and even
before there was either heaven or earth. John. 6. d. 37.
And that is the cause why it is said that it behooves us to be given to our
Lord Jesus Christ before we can come unto him. And who is it that makes that
gift? It is not every man's offering of himself of his own mere motion. True
it is that we ought to do so: for our faith imports obedience and sacrifize,
so as it becomes us to dedicate our selves to God willingly, and to make a
present both of our bodies and of our souls unto our Lord Jesus Christ, as to
him that has bought us. Nevertheless, this (as I said) is not of our own
mere motion, but God must be feign to bow us thereunto. And why so? Even
because we were his before. And how belong we too him? not by inheritance, nor
by any title that we can allege on our own behalf, but only because he choze
us. Now then we see what this text imports. But let us come back ^oo the
chief point that Saint Paul treats of here. For the things that I have
discoursed hithertoo, are but too show that our adoption serves not too
bereeue God of his glory, which thing they do that brag of their own free
will, virtues, and merits. Wherefore let us put away all such pride, and
confess that we be beholden too God for all things. Howbeit let us also
consider therewithal, that Saint Paul's rehearsing of this change, is too
assure us thoroughly, that the doctrine which he delivered us in his life, and
which we have now still in writing, is not of this world, nor forged of his
own brain, but a thing whereunto he was prepared of God. And we have need
to be grounded upon such a certainty, for else, whereas our faith ought too
get the upper hand of Satan and of all things that are against our
Salvation: it should always stagger, yea and be but a waueryng opinion. But
now let us see a little what battelles we have too endure. If we leaned
unto men, what should become of us? what steadiness would there be in us?
Seeing we be daily assailed with so many temptations, that by all lykelihood
we should be overwhelmed and perish: as for example, in that our nature is
so wholly inclined too distrust, too lying, too vanity, and too deceyt: and
again, in that we have so many lusts, which are as storms and whirlwindes to
overthrow all our faith: were it possible for us too stand or too have any
constancy, if we were not grounded upon God, and knew that the doctrine which
we follow is the pure truth that proceeds out of his mouth. Then stands
it us on hand too have that first of all. True it is that among the Papists
men will content themselves with some imaginacion. For it is enough with them,
too believe as the Church believes, as they say. Howbeit in the mean while
the Devil holds them in his nets, and they be like silly beasts that are
stark blind. But as for us, we must be out of all doubt, that we be taught
of God, and that the word which we follow is his. Therefore it behooves us to
give ear too the preaching of the doctrine which was brought by S. Paul, and
therewithal too consider that S. Paul did not thrust himself in of his own
head, but that God served his own turn by him, as by an instrument that he
had ordained too that purpose. Thus ye see wherevntoo it behooves us too
refer that which is spoken here. For had S. Paul followed Christianity
from his childehood, or had he learned it at school, truly it had bin a gift
of God: but then had not we had such an open auouchme^t and evident record as
we have by his change, in that of a ravening woolfe he became not only a
sheep, but also a sheepeheard: and whereas he had bin a deadly enemy of the
Gospel, now he is become a servant of our Lord Jesus Christ: and whereas erst
he had nothing in him but blasphemy, cruelty, pride and rebellion, we see he
has the zeal of Gods spirit, he has all humility and meekness. Seeing
then that we perceive so great and suddayne a change, it is as much as if God
had uttered his power of purpose that S. Paul should not be taken for a
mortal man. And verily for the same cause also did God take up Moses intoo
the Mountain, Exodus 24. c. 18.
and keep him there by the space of forty days, when he intended too have
his law published. For had Moses [foorthwith] preached the things which he
knew by revelation: surely he had discharged himself of his duty as a true
servant of God: but the thing had not bin known too be so excellent as it was,
in that God kept him forty days upon the Mountain, and afterward made him
come down with a shyning face, so as me^ could no more abide too look upon
him without dazeling of their eyes, than too look upon the brightness of the
Sun, but he was feign too put a veyle before him. Therefore all these things
serve too prove, that he devised not the law of his own head, but was as an
Angel of heaven, yea and much more excellent than an Angel, for so much as God
had ordained him therevntoo. In like case is it with the Apostles, for Jesus
Christ could well have chozen such as had bin exercyzed a long while aforehand
in the Law and holy Scriptures, and had some countenance to the worldward, and
had already purchaced some reputacio^ and degree among men: but he choze poor
silly souls and handycraftes men without any learning at all, and yet
notwithstanding made them too speak after such a strange fashion, that
through the eloquence and highness of knowledge which was in them, they passed
all such as had bin esteemed most skillful and sharpwitted in the world.
We see then that by Gods so suddayne changing of them, their doctrine was
made of so much the more authority unto us. Even so stands the case
concerning Saint Paul. That then is a thing which ought too confirm us, and
when soever we be taught by that which he has left in writing, let us
assure our selves that God speaks too us, and that he was the instrument of
our Lord Jesus Christ. He adds furthermore, that he did not then commune
with flesh and blood, that is too say with any mortal man, but went
streytwayes into Arabie, where be abode three years, and from thence returned
too Jerusalem too see Peter, and saw not any other of the Disciples than him
and James. Herein it might seem at the first blushe, that S. Paul had to
greatly disdeyned the rest of the Apostles. For although he had the knowledge
of the Gospel, yet might he well have bin more confirmed, and the consent and
agreement that Gods children have among themselves, does strengthen them the
more, as we find by experience. It seems then that Saint Paul disdayned a
mean that was fit for himself, and might have stood the whole Church in
good stead. But there was a special reason that drew him the other way:
which was, that men should not surmyze that it came to pass by worldly means,
for it was not yet sufficiently known. Then if he had gone too Jerusalem, and
communed with the Apostles, men would have said, this man is in some doubt,
and therefore he went thither too dispute, and in the end was overcome. And so
it would have bin thought that it had bin of man's doing, and the glory of
God had bin so much darkened thereby. But when as Saint Paul had bin a man
full of cruelty, that sought nothing but too abolishe the memorial of the
Gospel, a sheader of the blood of the Martyrs, a blasphemer of God, and an
inforcer of the poor weakelings too renounce Jesus Christ: when as men saw
him too be such a one, that is too say, as a man besides himself with such
rage, as he would never leave till he had borne down the Gospel: and yet
notwithstanding saw him so changed in one minute of an hour, and noman spoke
to him: yea and blinded and beaten down too the earth, so as he lay there like
a poor dead man, and afterward was rayzed up again as it were out of his
grave, and his eyes by miracle opened, so as God sent a man unto him of no
great fame named Ananias, who baptized him, strengthened him, and made him too
receive the vis^ble tokens of the holy Ghost: and that therevppon he went his
way into Arabie, a country where Jesus Christ had never bin spoken of before,
(for although the Jews had bin somewhat dispersed, yet was the Gospel utterly
unknown:) I say, when we see how Saint Paul went that way too work: who
is he that can say that he learned aught of men, or that he had bin won too
it by disputation, or by reason, or by any other manner of [worldly] means at
all? Nay rather we shall be constrained too grant, that what soever was too
be found in him, was of Gods putting intoo him. That then was the special
reason why Saint Paul communed not with the Apostles. And truly here he
speaks of them as it were in way of skorne, terming them flesh and blood.
Howbeit, it is not a defacing of the gifts which they had received of God,
when we make comparison between our Lord Jesus Christ and them. And we
ought too mark that well. For when we speak of men, surely they may well be
called flesh and blood, as we see they be called in the first of John.
John. 1. b. 13
Ye see then that men of their own nature are nothing but corruption. And for
as much as they would feign presume to much of their own wisdom and power,
or of their own righteousness and courage: therefore too put away all that
pride and fond ouerweening, God says What are ye? Math. 16. c. 18. and
John. ^. a. 6.
flesh and blood. Yea and sometimes by this saying flesh and blood, the holy
Scripture means this sinful nature of ours which we have since the fall of
Adam. For we have no more the vncorruptnesse that was in us, but contrariwise
we be utterly ignorant or rather beastly, and there is nothing but
filthiness in us, so as we be not able too do any thing that is aught
worth, furtherfoorth than God governs us. Lo in what wize we be termed flesh
and blood. And therefore it is said, that our being enlightened in the
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, comes not to us by heritage, nor is had
of flesh and blood, but that we be mad^ the children of God through his
begetting of us new again by his holy spirit, yea even after a special
manner. For we would hold altogether with the world, if he should let us
alone too our selves. Again, in the sixtenth of Saint Matthew it is said,
that fl^she and blood had not told Peter and his fellows that Jesus Christ
was the son of God: Mat. 16. c. 18.
but the heavenly father. Thus ye see how men are called flesh and blood:
namely when they be compared unto God, to show that we have not ought but
corruption in us. True it is that our souls are immortal: nevertheless the
Scripture speaks so of us in way of contempt, to the end we should be
void of presumption. But as for the Apostles, they were already regenerated
by Gods spirit: and therefore there was more in them than flesh and blood, as
we have seen by the Text last alleged. Yet notwithstanding, whenever they
be compared with God, then must all that is of our own nature be comprehended
under the terms of flesh and blood. And why? For else it should come in
question, too know whether the Apostles might by their own worthiness and
excellency prejudice the Gospel, as the foresaid troublers pretended to
shroud themselves withal. But Saint Paul shows, that if God withdraw that
which is his, there shall remain nothing either in Peter, John, or James, but
that they be the sons of Adam as other men are, so as there is nothing in
them but corruption. So then let us not abuse the gracions gifts that God has
put into them, to deface the Majesty of him and the Gospel. Thus ye see after
what manner Saint Paul speaks here of the Apostles. For we have heard how
he said heeretoofore, that if an Angel from heaven should gainsay the
Gospel, he ought to be hated and cursed as if he were a Devil. And how so?
Is it meet that men should speak so reprochfully of the Angels which are so
noble creatures, and which are called the heavenly principalities and powers of
God? Ephe. 1. d. 2^
It is no wrong at all too do so too them, when it comes to the yielding of
sovereign dominion too our Lord Jesus Christ who is their head, for it
behooves them too be placed under him. Therefore let us not think we have
any wrong offered us, though we were trodden a hundred times under foot, so it
be to the exalting of Gods name, and that our Lord Jesus Christ may have his
duty and supremacy reserved unto him, so as he may be heard both of great
and small, and all men submit themselves too him in true obedience of faith.
Now herevppon we may gather how blind the wretched Papists are in honoring
the Apostles and Martyrs in such wise, that God is robbed of his honor and
service, insomuch as it should seem that all that belongs and is reserved to
him is put to the spoil and pray [among them.] For what difference make they
between him and his creatures? And besides that, our Lord Jesus Christ is as
good as buried, because they pluck away the office from him that was given
him. For in sted of being our Advocate too give us entrance unto God his
father, and that we should go right forth unto him if we intend too have
our prayers and supplications heard: they have set up an infinite multitude
of Advocates, Patrones and Intercessours, and Jesus Christ is Jack out of
office. Now when we see that the creatures have obtained such honor among
men, that by that means God is as it were thrust back, and his word borne
down: thereby we perceive that the Diuill has turned all vpside down.
Therefore how soever the world go, let our esteeming of men be after such a
sort, as God may hold still that which is his own: and if we compare him with
his creatures, let us consider that all is but vanity, and whatsoever
commendation they have here, the same is a record which God gives us of his
love, to the end we should keep onwards unto him, and he be exalted. Yea and
let us consider, that we cannot honor God as he deserves, but by submitting
our selves to his word. For all they that make many Ceremonies to bear men in
hand that they desire to serve God, are mislyked of him, until such time as
they be subdued to him, and also to his word. And that also is a cause why S.
Paul stryueth for the authority of the Gospel. For he thinks it not enough
too have God and Jesus Christ talked of: but he will also have every man to
receive the doctrine contained in the Gospel, without gainsaying. And hereby
we see, how that nowadayes all Religion is decayed, and there is nothing but
hellishe confuzion in Popery. For there is talking enough of our Lord Jesus
Christ, but after what sort? Know they his power? Can they tell too what end
he is sent of God his Father, and what benefytes he brings us? No whit at
all. He shall be called the Savior of the world, and in the mean while
every man seeks his salvation in himself, or at some Saints hand of his
own forging. Lo at what point they be. And therefore so much the more does it
stand us upon, to bear in mind the thing that is showed us here: which is,
that whenever God is spoken of, Esa. 24. ^
the very Sun and Moon must needs be darkened (as it is said in the
Prophet,) Esa. 6* d. 16
and there is not any that must not be thrust under foot, too the end that
God may have all preeminence. And forasmuch as God accepts any honor or
service that we do unto him, until we be subject too his word: let us
receive the whole doctrine of the Gospel and let nothing pluck us back from
yielding such reverence thereunto, as too submit our selves too all that is
contained therein. This in effect is the thing that we have too gather upon
this place, where the Apostles are termed flesh and blood* Furthermore whereas
Saint Paul adds, that he went to Jerusalem too see Peter: it is a sure
record that his former speaking of his going intoo Arabie, was not of any
pride or disdain, but too the end that Gods grace might be known, and that
no worldly means might be made as a veyle too keep men from knowing that
Jesus Christ had wrought by singular miracle, in that a man which had bin so
stubborn before, had been brought too the lure. Thus ye see on the on the
one side, how Saint Paul meant too reserve unto God his due: and on the other
side, that yet notwithstanding he meant to show there was good agreement
between him and the other Apostles. And even so must we do. For in many men
there are always two evil extremities too be found in that behalf. There
are some scoffers which make pretense to magnify gods grace, and in the mean
time are but traitors to God, full of poison and pride, preferring their own
dreams and dotages before him. If a man say unto them, how now? Seeing that
God has granted grace to many men, and they be known to be men well seen in
the holy scriptures, and they employ themselves faithfully in preaching the
Gospel to us: therefore why do ye not agree with them? O (say they) I have not
to do with any man living upon earth, I ground my self upon none but God.
These are the proud and stately, which pretend to have the holy Ghost in their
heads, and certain revelations of the holy Ghost, and yet notwithstanding
they break the unity of the Church, and dispize Gods gracious gifts. So much
the more therefore does it stand us on hand to keep the measure that we see
here. For although Saint Paul have on the one side declared, that he went
straight ways into Arabie as soon as he was converted, too the end it might
be known that Jesus Christ had bin his only master and teacher, as indeed he
only ought always to have preeminence over us: yet nevertheless he has also
well showed [on the other side,] that he meant to be in unity of good concord
with the rest of the Apostles, and was desirous too have it known to the whole
world, that his mind was too agree with them, and that they were as
instruments of the holy Ghost. For as I have showed before, it is no small help
too the confirmation of our faith, when we be so linked together, and that God
calls not any one man alone, but has many that submit themselves too him, so
that it is seen that they be guided all by one spirit, that they be all of
one mind, that they ame all at one mark, and that they show themselves to be
Gods children, by going on forward too the heritage of the heavenly life. That
help then is fit for the confirmation of our faith: and it was for Saint Paul
too show that he was rightly linked with the Apostles, and meant not too
separate himself from them. Wherefore let us mark the manner of dealing that
is showed us here, to the intent we swerve not to the one extremity or the
other. But there are some so lightheaded, that they will give over the doctrine
of the Gospel for right naught, and as soon as they hear a man speak, by
and by they must receive whatsoever he says. Howbeeit, if we be no better
settled than so, shall we be able too withstand all the alarums which the
Devil our mortal enemy will give us? Then must men stand stout to their
tackling, and all of us from the most too the least, must stick fast together
too our Lord Jesus Christ. For like as he is our head, so must he also be
exalted, Esa. 11. c. 12
and (as the Prophet Esaias says) he is the mark that all men must look at.
Since it is so, let us learn to forbear our resting in such wise upon the
outward appearance of men, that the same should impeache the majesty of Gods
Son. But yet nevertheless, when we be once fully settled upon that point: we
must all of us be contented to be taught of him that is given us too be our
teacher, and not be so proud as to stand every man in his own conceyt, (for
so shall we but make variance in the Church:) but desire to agree together, and
every of us put forth that which is given him, that the unity of our faith may
be [as a bonde] to knit us together, so as we may make one Temple of God. For
it is not said for naught, that we be the lively stones whereof Gods Temple is
builded. Now if every of us should be sundred from other, and left alone by
himself: what would become of it? Should there be any building? No: but
contrariwize there would be utter desolation. If we covet to have God dwell
among us, and too be of householde with us, we must worship him truly, and
every of us apply himself as much as he can possibly to his neighbors. Not
that we must shrink from God to cleave to men (for it were better that we
should all of us be at discord one with another, and together by the ears
as whot as fire among our selves:) but when we be knitte unto God, that is a
good harmony: and that is the mean for us to hold the way that Saint Paul
hilde, who would not match himself with the Apostles to darken Gods glory,
or to hinder the doctrine of the Gospel, and yet notwithstanding failed not to
come from a strange country to seek them, yea even with great travel, and
with the enduring of right hard temptation: for (as we see) they charged him to
have bin a persecuter of God and his truth. Seeing that S. Paul came after
that sort to show how conformable he was with the rest of the Apostles, and
too give record thereof to the whole Church: therein we see, that the
desirousnesse which he had to serve God, and his stoutnesse too advance Gods
word above all creatures, let him not to be full of courtesy and modesty
also. And even so must we do too. That is to say, we must receive the consent
of our brethren, and seek to conform our selves too them in such wise, as we
may all be members of one body, and Jesus Christ be our head, and not be
scattered asunder, nor every man walk alone by himself, but seek to
communicate after such manner one with another, as every man may guide his
neybour, and all go on forward to one mark, and each of us give courage to
other, so as there may be seen a good agreement among us. True it is that we
cannot have peace with all men: we shall fail greatly of that. And therefore
S. Paul in another place says, that we must seek to be at peace with all
men, To. 12. d. 18
at leastwise as much as is in us: whereby he shows, that we shall be
constreyned to be at variance with many folks. For the Devil has many
underlings, and they be all of them bent against Gods word: and we also must
set our selves against them, if we intend to have the pure doctrine of the
Gospel on our side. But howsoever the case stand, if we see any man willing
to submit himself too our Lord Jesus Christ, let us receive him, let us
prevent him, let us seek to agree wholly together, and let us not look to be
honored above other men, nor say how now? If I should agree with such a man,
it would seem that I am become his underling. VVo be too us if we have such
pride in us. But let our only seeking be, to have Jesus Christ to be our
head, and in such wise become members of his body, as we may all woorship
him, and call upon him with one mouth in unity of faith.

And now let us fall down before the Majesty of our good God with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him too make us feel them more and
more, to the end we may mislyke them, and beseech him to amend them by his
holy spirit, that being quite rid of our sins and wretchedness, w^ may be
renewed after his Image, so as he may be glorified in all our life, and in the
mean while bear with us in our frailty, til he have brought us to the
perfection from whence we be all gone away. And so let us all say, Almighty
God heavenly father. etc.

The. 7. Sermon upon the first Chapter, which is also the first upon the second
Chapter.
22 For I was unknown by face to the Churches of Ievvrie that were in
Christ.

23 Save only they had heard say, he that erevvhiles persecuted us, does now
preach the faith which he had destroyed for a ^ime.

24 And they glorified God in me.


The second Chapter.
About fourteen years afte, I went up again too Jerusalem with Barnabas,
and took Titus with me also.

2 And I went up by revelation, and communed with them concerning the Gospel
that I preach among the Gentiles, hovvbeeit privately with those that are in
estimation, least I might in any wise run, or have run in vain.


We have seen how S. Paul has on the one side published the Gospel
through the whole world without warrant of any man, co^tenting himself in that
he was sure he served God, and that his labor was acceptable to him: and yet
notwithstanding has not forslowed in the mean while, to seek brotherhod, and
good agreement with the Apostles, as a thing right requisite to succor the
infirmity of such as might have bin thrust out of the way, unless God had
helped them in their feebleness. So have we on the one side a warrant of S.
Paul's doctrine: and on the other side we see how he intended to gather
together gods children, to the end they might be joined in one band of faith,
and glorify God as it were with one heart, one mind, and one mouth. And
therwithall we see also, that S. Paul passed not to ask counsel whether he
should go foreward or backward. For although he were unknown to such as had bin
in the faith before him: yet forslowed he not to serve God, whereunto he had
bin erst called. And this surely is one very notable point more: for it
shows us that he was wholly bent to serve God, and looked not for his hire at
men's hands, to the end they should pleasure him or esteem of him as he
deserved. Wherefore let us learn to walk after such a fashion in the vocation
whereunto we be called, that although men look not upon us, yet we may not
cease to discharge our duties faithfully, contenting our selves in that it
pleased god to allow of us. For they that hang upon me^ shall always be
attainted with some spice of vainglory, and it will be impossible for the^ to
walk purely and sou^dly.

Besides this, Act. 9. d. 26
Saint Luke shows us that Saint Paul must needs have bin led with an
invincible constancy, seeing he stepped not out of the way, although men made
no reckening at all of his doings. For he says that the faithful had him in
suspicion, and that they shunned him when he came too Jerusalem. Now it was a
grievous temptation to Saint Paul, to see that he could not be received
intoo the company of the faithful, considering that he had suffered so much
already. For we know that at his first coming to Damasco, 2. Cor. 11. g 33.
the gates were shet upon him, (as we have seen heretofore) so that he was
feign too be let down in a Panyer or Basket. Ye see then that as soon as he
was converted to the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, he was by and by tossed
with great persecutions. After that, he went intoo the Country of Arabie, and
there traveled faithfully. And thinks he for all that, too have friendship
and atonement with the faithful? The gate is shette against him, and men
shun him as a wild beast. But before [hee was turned to the faith,] he had
bin honored, and in great credit, both with the enemies of the Gospel, and
in the Sinagog of the Jews. He had renounced all these things, even so far
as too see himself banished out of the place: and yet for all that, they
vouchsafed not to admit him to have place in the Church. Wherefore he might
have bin so grieved at such unkindness, as it might have made him to have
given over all, if he had had his mind tied here bylowe. Howbeeit forasmuch as
he had given himself wholly too Gods service, and was fully determined too
hold out to the end although men cunned him no thank for his labor:
therefore he turned not aside from his right way. And such examples ought too
encourage us at this day, when we see there are so few (yea even in the
Church,) that like well of the thing that is done of a pure and right meaning
zeal, insomuch that some backbyte it through envy, others are so squeymish as
a man cannot by any means content them, and other some are full of wicked
slaunderousnesse and lying. Therefore forasmuch as we see how men do
oftentimes cause us to swerve one way or other: let us learn to give our
selves in such wise unto God, as we may steadfastly continue in the way which
he shows us, and not excuze our selves by our own weakness, seeing that
Saint Paul goes before us, and reaches us his hand. He was a frail man as
we be, and yet did God strengthen him in such wise by his holy spirit, that he
ouerpassed such lettes. Wherefore seeing we perceive our selves to be
weak, let us beseech God to arm us with such constancy, as we may not
cease to discharge our duty toward him, though some misreport us, some
blame us, and othersome mock us, and make none account of all our labor when
we indeuer to do well. Although then that our labor seem to be lost and
misspent, yet let it suffice us that God lyketh and allows of it. And so ye
see what we have too gather upon that Text. Above all things, let us not
covet to be renowned, and too get great fame in this world: for let us streyne
our selves as much as may be possibly, and yet shall we never be better,
than Saint Paul was. After he had preached the Gospel in such wise, yea even
as a man continually rapt up intoo heaven, insomuche that although the
revelation whereof he speaks in the second too the Corinthians, 2. Co. 12.
a. 2
was exhibited too him but for one time, yet the fruit of it showed it self
all the time of his life: yet notwithstanding he was unknown in the mean
while: yea even in all the Churches of Iewrie. And so it might seem well that
he had not greatly profyted, seeing that all his labor was buried. But it was
enough for him that God edified the furthest strangers by his means. We see
then that he sought not too be much renowned, nor too purchase credit and
authority among men. As concerning that he says, the Churches of Iewrie
that were in Christ: he adds that word of purpose, because there was yet
still some seed of God among the Jews, and the promises were so given too
them, as they were not utterly cut off, until such time as they renounced
Jesus Christ quite and clean, and thereby were utterly bereft of the
inheritance of the life that was assigned unto them. For like as God had
chosen the line of Abraham: so our Lord Jesus Christ came intoo the world too
be the minister of those whom God had so adopted, and to perform the
promises that had bin given to their fathers. Our Lord Jesus Christ rejected
not the Jews too whom the promises belonged (according also as it is said in
the second of the Acts) but the Church of God abode among them still, Act. 2.
f. 39.
and their Circumcision was not a thing devised by man. And although they were
al grown out of kind, and many errors and wicked opinions were crept in
among them, so as Gods service was turmoyled, and Religion corrupted: yet
notwithstanding, that people was acknowledged for Gods householde flock. The
Sinagoges therefore that had not yet bewrayed their unbelief by withdrawing
themselves from Jesus Christ, are reckened here by Saint Paul for Churches,
howbeeit, not for perfect Churches, for they were not yet regenerated in Jesus
Christ. For then was the renewing of the whole world, when Jesus Christ was
sent too bring home unto God, both those that were near hand, Ephesians. 2. d. 17
and those that were far off: near hand, as the Jews which had the law
still: and a far off, as the heathen men who had no likelihood of the
heavenly kingdom, because God had left them like poor wild beasts, and they
were strayed away in their own superstitions and Idolatries. But Jesus Christ
came to gather all together, and to knit all things together again that were
scattered before. And thereby we see how the law ought to have led the Jews to
the Gospel, as it is said throughout all the holy Scripture. And it is very
needful for us [to know the same,] least we surmize that none of all the
things that are contained in the law, can stand us in any stead in these days.
For it is certain, that although the Ceremonies be no more in use, yet the
truth and substance of them remain always unto us, so as we cannot even at
this day be faithful, but we must also be the children of Abraham, and the
disciples of Moses. Not that we must be hilde still under the old shadows:
but that we must match things together which cannot be put asunder: that is to
wit, the Law and the Gospel. But yet further, let us understand, that we
cannot at this day be counted for the Church before God, (that is to say, all
the companies of men in the world cannot obtain that honorable title*)
except we be in Jesus Christ. For that head must knitte us unto God his
father, and by that means must we have entrance into the kingdom of heaven.
And therefore as for all them that know not Jesus Christ, although they be
marked with baptism, and bear the name of Christians: yet are they but as
^otten members vt^erly cut off, notwithstanding that they pretend too be of
the troop and number of Gods children. Thus ye see still what we have too
mark upon this Text. Furthermore Saint Paul adds, that the common report
was, that he which had erst persecuted the faith, did preach the same, and
that God was glorified by that means. Here once again we see that Saint
Paul preaches not his own praises, for he condemns himself too have
been an enemy and persecuter of the Church. True it is that he speaks of
the common report: but yet does he rehearce the very thing as it was done in
deed. So then he cloketh not the thing that was too his own reproach and
shame. A^man might have cast him in the teeth, that he had persecuted the
poor faithful ones, that he had too the uttermost of his power shed innocent
blood, yea and that he had compelled the weaklings to blaspheme. But yet for all this, he grants to this indictment of his own accord, and speaks not as
most men do, who make as it were a glory of it, that they have bin enemies of
the Gospel. It is certain that Saint Paul in making such rehersall, was
touched with earnest sorinesse for that misbehauiour of his, 1. Co. 15. a. ^
according as in another Text he says, that he is not worthy to be called
an Apostle. Now then, ye may be sure he felt always some pricking in his
heart, for that he had erst so rebelled against God, and bin so evil mynde^,
yea and altogether spiteful against the Gospel* Nevertheless howsoever the
world went with him, he had lever to acknowledge his fault with all humility,
than to leave the thing unsought that might be to Gods glory. So then let us
learn with him, too acknowledge simply the offenses that we have committed,
when it stands upon the honoring of God and let us not be loath to receive
some sha^e before men. For that is the way for us also too have our sins
buried before God, so as they may never come to account, nor to remembrance
more: that is to wit, if we be contented too sustain some mark of infamy
before men if need be, that God may have his due. This therefore is the thing
which we have too remember in that it is said, that the common report went
that he had erst destroyed the faith, as he had done in deed. Truly the
faith of the Gospel shall evermore get the upper hand of all the assaults of
Satan, and of all the wicked: Therefore it lay not in Saint Paul's power (...)
abolishe the faith nor too overthrow it, at such time as he was carried with
such fury as we have seen. For the faith is grounded upon Gods truth which
is invincible, it is not subject too the opinions of men. But Saint Paul had
respect here too the infirmity of the simple sort whom he had cast down as
much as lay in him. Act. 26. c. 11
For it is said in the Acts, that he did not only persecute the Christians,
but also made some of them too recant. Like as nowadayes when any great number
is persecuted, some spare neither their blood nor their lives for the
confessing of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Othersome redeem this
wretched and flightfull life by recanting, so that they banish themselves from
the Kingdom of heaven as much as they can, cast themselves intoo Satan's
snares, and throw themselves headlong into endless death, and all too escape
the hands of Tyrants and of their enemies. Therefore Saint Paul's cruelty is
purposely condemned by the holy Ghost, for that he not only was full of pride
and stubbornness against God, but also had enforced many too recant and give
over the faith of the Gospel. Ye see then how he behaved himself: and that
must serve for our learning. For although the word abide still in his full
state, and we prejudice it not at all by our weakness: yet notwithstanding
the faith is cast down in our persons. For if I swerve too please Gods
enemies, or if I disguyze the truth, or by any means dissemble: then is my
faith defaced.

True it is (as I have said already) that Gods word shall always hold his
own: and yet oftentimes the fall of one man shall draw a great havoc after
it. If men see some one person recant, at whose hand great constancy was
looked for: then are many poor souls shaken, and they wot not what too say.
True it is that we ought not to rest upon men: but yet for all that, (as we
shall declare again anon) there are many that have need too be confirmed by
good example. Now if a man cast a stumbling block in their way, they be as
good as utterly overthrown, or else they be so hartshaken as they wot not
where to become. Wherefore let us learn to commit our selves unto god! and
seeing that the devil has so many underlings which seek nothing but too bring
all too confusion, and employ themselves wholly to ouerwhelme the Christian
faith: let us pray God to strengthen us with such constancy, as our enemies
may be put too shame though we be assailed neerelyer than we be. And let us
not only care every man for himself, but also for the great number of poor
souls whom we see as it were in the VVoolues mouth: for they shall be
tormented and threatened, and finally labored by flatteryes and allurements too
recant. Therefore when we fee such assaults given too our brothers: at
leastwize let us have the heart too pray God too aid them at their need, so
as their faith may continue still invincible, and get the upper hand, and
that they may never swerve, for all that ever Satan and all his brood can
practice. So much the more then behooves it us to mark this Text, where it is
said that Saint Paul did cast down and destroy the faith. For although God
will always maintain his truth: yet do not men cease too go too
destruction, because their faith is shaken by swaruing and stepping aside from
the right way. Furthermore, we have wherewith too confirm our selves, so
that although men continue not in such constancy as were requisyte, and too
be wyshed, yet let us not be too much abashed at it, seeing it is a thing
that has been common in all ages. Was Saint Paul's preaching of the less
credit, because there were many renegates, that in the end showed themselves
too be Hypocrites and full of unfaithfulness? Even some of his own
companions that had been linked with him as two fingers of one hand, gave
him quyte over in the end. And yet must not Saint Paul's doctrine be
rejected for all that. Also when he persecuted the Christians before he was
converted, although that many had renounced the salvation which they should
have accepted as it was offered them in Jesus Christ: yet ought not the faith
too be defaced therefore. Likewise in these days when we see many wretched
folk quayle and give over all, and othersome again hold out at whose hands
we would not have looked for any great constancy: let us profit our selves
thereby, and be out of all doubt that although the whole world go too ruin,
yet we have a good and sure foundation, if we rest upon our God. Now
whereas Saint Paul adds, that the faithful glorified God in him: it is too
show the better, (so as men might perceive it even by eysight) that the
change which was made in him, proceeded of the only hand of God. And all of
it comes too this point, namely that he had not thrust himself in, and that
it could not be laid too his charge that he had preached at all adventure,
nor that there was any rashness or presumption in him, or that he was driven
with any worldly respect, but that God had governed and guyded him. For whereas
the faithful had glorified God in him: it was by acknowledging that the
renewing of such a man after that fashion, and the making of a ravening Wolf
too become a Sheep, yea and a Sheephearde, was his work, and a very miracle
that proceeded from him. Mark that for a special point. And hereby we see
briefly, that they on whom God has bestowed gifts of grace, so as they excel
and are far above all others, must not therefore advance themselves, but
find means that the praise may be yielded too him that has right too it,
and which has deserved it. Wherefore let us keep this rule of humility,
which is, that we seek not our own estimation, nor too prefer our selves
above our neighbors, for any of the gifts that God has bestowed upon us,
but that God may always have his preeminence, and every of us learn too
glorify him for it, when we see any of his gracious gifts in any man. And
that is very needful: for there has always been such spytefulnesse among
men, that every man enuyeth his companyon, because all men desire to be
greatest. And until God have well tamed us, and we be learned to obey meekely:
it is certain that there is none of us all, but he would feign ouerreache his
fellow. Now out of this ambition spring always envy and strife, together
with disdain, grudging, backbyting, and such other like things. But
contrariwyse, when we have well digested the rule that is given us here, by
and by we learn too glorify God as often as we see any tokens that come from
him. For when we envy those whom God would have honored, and go about too
deface his gifts which we perceive in them, and all excellency: surely we
do not only offer wrong too mortal creatures, but also too God, who is the
Author of the gifts in them. [As for example:] I see a man that is able too
edify the Church, and God has endued him with such gifts, that his labor
may do good: now I fearing least he should be advanced too much, and I
be plucked back by it, do go about by my slanders and overthwart means,
too deface and diminishe the thing that God has put in him. It is all one
as if he would hyde all Gods gifts, and bring them in contempt.

And whereof comes this, but of the cursed ambition that I spoke of before?
Now in such heauing at men, there will always be some strife and
hartburning: and too be short, all must needs go too wrack, because God is
offended at it. For at whom do these wrongs ame? True it is that I do wrong
too my neighbor whom I disgrace after that sort: but therewithal I do also
blaspheme God: so as we cannot deface the gifts and virtues that are in any
man, but that our dooyng is forthwith matched with blasphemy, wherethrough
God is grievously offended. And why? For God will be acknowledged in all his
gifts, and when he offers himself unto us, it is good reason that we
should honor him. Therefore whenever we see any tokens of the holy Ghost
in any man, if we tread them under foot, or hold scorn of them, and
mislyke them: is it not a defacing of Gods Majesty too the vttermoste of our
power? Truly we will not confess it, but yet is it so in very deed. And
therefore must we take so much the better heed of that which is spoken
here: namely that the faithful glorified GOD in the person of Saint Paul,
when they saw he had wrought after that manner in him: and that by that
means we be put in mind that we be bound too yield God his dew honor,
whenever he offers or shows us any of his gifts. For the reproach or
wrong is not done too the creature: but it is GOD that is unregarded in so
dooyng; because he is defrauded and robbed of the right that belongs unto
him.

And so much the more does it stand us on hand to remember this lesson,
because we see this naughtiness too be as great nowadayes, as ever it was.
How many are there that commend the gifts of God that are profitable for the
common edifying, and for the welfare of the whole Church? Nay rather, the
Devil bears such a sway, that every man through his own unthankfulness,
hinders himself too receive the fruit of Gods gifts, whereof he might be
parttaker. So then if we had honest and well meening hearts, surely we
should always fare the better when we saw any good example: and where any
man is endued with Gods gifts, we should apply the same too our own
profit: but we shette our selves out of the doors through our own
cankerhartednesse, so as we cannot enjoy the benefit that is offered us.
Again, we see there are some so spiteful, that of very malice they would
feign make men believe that the Sun shyneth not: ye shall see them so
diuelishe, that it spyteth them at the heart too see Gods name glorified by
another man's means. Must that fellow have the honor say they? Verily as who
should say, that every man ought not too have an eye too the abacing of
himself, that God might be honored as he deserves, in the gifts that he
gives men as he himself lists. But there are some so cankerhearted, that
they could find in their hearts too pluck God out of his seat, rather than
too abide those patiently whom he has endued with his gifts, and which
employ themselves to the edifying of his Church, or that men should receive
them and acknowledge that God will be honored in them. Seeing then that men
are nowadayes so full of malice and venim: we have the more need too bear in
mind what is showed us here: that is too wit, that God must be glorified
in all his benefits that are seen of us, assuring our selves that they come
all of his mere liberality, and that he is the Author of all good qualities,
so as there is not that commendable thing in any creature, which ought not too
be fathered upon him. Wherefore let us learn too glorify God in all
points and all respects.

Now hereupon he adds, that yet once again he made a journey to Jerusalem,
and commoned with such as bare the countenance and had most authority, too the
end he might not [seeme too] have run in vain heretofore, nor run in vain
hereafter. Here we see how S. Paul was never satisfied in seeking all that
might be too the advancement of the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
too the taking away of lettes, too the intent that the Gospel might have his
free course and full scope, yea and that he was not led thereunto by vain
presumptuousnesse, as we saw this morning: but considered that the wicked
sort would lay to his charge, that yet at length he came too submit himself
too the Apostles, too learn somewhat at their hands. He considered that this
might well be said unto him: but hap what hap would, he intended not too
forslowe his duty in seeking agreement with the [other] Apostles. I say not
that he sought a worldly matter at worldly men's hands: but too make his doings
well allowed in all points. For it is certain that S. Paul going too
Jerusalem, was not too skan who had taught best: but too make a mutual
declaration among themselves, that every one of them had served God and
preached the Gospel faithfully. That is the cause why S. Paul went thither.
Therefore we see here his mildness, in that he spares not himself at all,
so the Church may receive any fruit or confirmation of faith by it, and men may
be well assured that the Apostles reckened him as one of their array and
company. Again, besides his mildness, we see also his zeal. It had bin
enough for him too have run into many countries: he had bin in Arabie and
gone about all that land: he had bin in Cilicia where he was borne, and also in
Syria: and afterward having first gone about the whole land of Iewrie, he
returned too Jerusalem. Seeing he made all these voyages, and took none ease at
all: it was a token that he would lever have bin dead than alive, so the
kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ might have bin furthered by it, and the
Church have received any profit by his travel, as I said before. When we
see such examples, let us on the one side learn to cut off our own
slothfulness, and to be more hearty in praying unto God, not too suffer us
too lie weltering always in our vices when we be over cold, but too waken us
up, and too grant us the grace too spend our selves in his seruis, specially
at need and when necessity requires it: and therewithal too strengthen us
in the doctrine that S. Paul brings, seeing that his serving too the glory of
God and too our welfare, was in good earnest. For had he done it faynedly, it
is certain that he could have gone too work after the manner of worldly
folk. But now seeing he came without fetching, and sought friendship and concord
with the faithful although he were rejected, and spared not himself though the
pains and labors that he took were not known of: it is a sign that he
walked as before God, and that the holy Ghost guyded him in all respects.
Furthermore whereas he says that he co^moned with those that were esteemed
and had in reputation, to the end he might not [seeme to] have run in vain,
nor run in vain [hereafter:] he meeneth not that he had lost his labor, if
noman living had allowed of his doings: but he had an eye too many weaklings
which should have bin in doubt, if God should not by that means have drawn
them too the full knowledge and certainty of the Gospel. I told you not long
since, that our faith must needs be overthrown, (howbeit not in respect of
it self, but in respect of our infirmity,) when we quayle. Even so the labor
of those that preach and publishe the Gospel is vain and frutelesse, because
we profit not as were too be wished, except God bliss the labor and give
it increacement. Whereas Saint Paul says, to the end it may not seem that
he had runned in vain: it is not to be understood that such as preach the
Gospel do lose their labor and avail not at all except God bliss their
doyngs by his together woorking: for the preaching of the Gospel shall always
be an acceptable sacrifize unto God, although the world receive nothing but
death and damnation by it, according as we have seen how Saint Paul in the
second too the Corinthians says, we be a good savor unto God. Although the
unbelievers be poyzoned by the Gospel through their own lewdness, and it
seem too them that there is nothing else but filthiness in it: yet will God
always take in good worth the sacrifize that we offer unto him. So then, in
this text Saint Paul meant not to say that he had run in vain, as though
God had bin mocked by him, and that his preaching had bin too no purpose: but
he had an eye too those whom he had taught, and too those also whom he intended
too teach too the end, how that they were not edified when they perceived not
some good agreement betwixt him and the other Apostles, which were known to be
ordained by our Lord Jesus Christ. Here a man might cast some doubt, whither
those persons were faithful or no, in as much as they had not believed the
Gospel, except they had bin aided by men. The answer is easy: namely that the
only word of God ought to suffize for our faith. If it be demanded whereupon
our faith is grounded, and how it comes to full perfection: it is by Gods
word. How so? Are not the Sacraments added to the word? Yes, as helps
because we be ouerweake: yea and there is an Oath also, in so much that God
swears: all which things are over and besides the word, yea and as an
overplus. But he intends too lift us up again when he sees us stumble: and
when we be so weak that we trust not so certainly to his power as we should
do, he gives us such helps. For when we see good agreement between Gods
servants, surely it helps us much, and it is a good warrant unto us. Likewise
the blood of Martyrs ought surely to be a great furtherance of our salvation,
and we must be confirmed by it, as though it were some seal too make Gods
doctrine of the more authority among us. Then are they helps too draw us to
the faith, and too maintain and confirm us in the same. As much is too be
said of miracles. Miracles do not give us belief of Gods word, but prepare us
to it. For God utters his power in them, too the end we should be the better
wakened, and his word have the more reverence among us, and finally they serve
us for seals. For when we believe the Gospel, and that our belief is not
utterly out of all doubt: God adds that confirmation. Eue^ so is it with the
thing that S. Paul treats of presently. For what a thing had it bin, if men
had seen any disagreement or trouble betwixt such as were of great authority?
What might the silly souls have thought, but that they must have bin amazed
at it and said, Alas, what means this? We wot not on which side too turn
us. Seeing there is such variance between those which should show us the way,
that one draws clean contrary and back too other: alas how may we now
be assured? Thus ye see that many simple folk had bin sore shaken. And that
is it which Saint Paul mente by saying, that he intended too common with
Peter and John and James, for a witness through the whole world, that they
allowed of his doings, and that the Gospel which he preached was no strange
doctrine, but the very same Gospel that Jesus Christ had taught his disciples,
and which he had commanded them too publish over all the world, and whereof
he had committed the charge unto them. And hereby we be done too understand
again, that beside S. Paul's zeal, mildness, stoutnesse, and constancy:
God foresaw even then, that this agreement which he uttered betwixt him and the
other Apostles, would serve to confirm us also even at this day by reason of
our weakness. For as much therefore as we be raw and weak, let us apply to
our use all the helps that God gives us, and let us also for our part
indeuer too agree in such wyze with the children of God, as every of us may be
a help too his neighbor, and not imbattell our selves against another. For woe
be to him that shall sow such Darnell, as the ignorant and weak sort shall be
hindered by it. And therewithal let us consider the mischief that may happen,
when such as have the charge too preach the Gospel, are so disfamed, by
slanders, or else so brought in suspicion, as a man cannot tell whither he may
believe them or no, as though God had not ordained them too advance the
kingdom of his Son, and too publish the Gospel in many Countries, or at
leastwise among many folk that should be edified by them. Cursed be he
therefore that shall cast such a stumblingblocke in their ways. So then, let
us by all means indeuer too agree with those that serve God, and too help such
as have the gift and ability too edify the Church, and are put in office.
Let us lend them our hand, that their labor may be profitable both for our
selves and for all our neighbors, that by that means God may be glorified,
and we more and more with one heart and one mouth call upon him as our father.

And now let us fall down before the Majesty of our good God with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him too make us so to feel them, as it
may draw us to right repentance, and make us beseech him too use his infinite
mercy toward us, until he have so rid us of all our imperfections, that we
may behold him face to face as he is, and attain too the perfection wherevntoo
he calls us now by his word, and whereunto it behooves us to go foreward all
our life long, being well assured that we cannon come too it, till we be rid
of our flesh, and taken out of this prison wherein we be now hilde under the
bondage of sin. That it may please him too grant this grace not only too
us, but also too all people and nations of the earth, etc.

The. 8. Sermon which is the second upon the second Chapter.
3 And Titus also who was with me, although he were a Greek, was not
compelled too be circumcized.

4 Because of the false brethren that were privily crept in, to spy out our
liberty which we have in Jesus Christ, to the end to bring us into bondage.

5 To whom we yielded not in way of subjection, even for an hour, to the
intent that the truth of the Gospel might continue in you.


We find well enough what an enemy of our welfare the Devil is, since he
ceasseth not to labor by all means too stop the course of the Gospel. And
therein we perceive also, that God has set al our welfare, joy, and
happiness, in being taught by his word. For the Devil would not be so
hasty to trouble that doctrine, unless he knew that the whole welfare of men
lies therein. True it is that he laboreth sore and streyneth himself too
deface Gods glory: but they be things that go together. For God of his
gracious goodness has appointed that too be the mean too reign among us,
and to gather us unto himself: and all our welfare is too cleave unto him and
too join with him. Now therefore the Devil not only stirs up many enemies
to make war against the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: but also laboreth
too stir up much strife among our selves, and too make us enemies one too
another, and that has bin his practice at all times, as we see by example in
the things that Saint Paul reherceth too us here. We know what alarams
were given him euerywhere, and what a number of battelles and plundges he was
put unto, by reason that the Heathen and the unbelievers did (to the uttermost
of their power) withstand the preaching of Gods word: and yet over and besides
this, he shows how there were deceyuers also, which wound themselves in
slyly, and entered in as it were by stealth. For the Greek word that he
uses, imports so much, and it cannot well be expressed [by any one woord] in
our [french] tunge. His meening then is that there were Cousiners which
intermedled themselves vndermyningly with the faithful, and yet all was no
more but to cause the truth of the Gospel to be corrupted. And let us mark,
that those dogs pretended not to reject utterly the whole doctrine of our
Lord Jesus Christ: but rather bare the name and title of Christianity. Howbeit
in the mean while their intent was to have a halffaste Gospel, which should
be another fish nor flesh (as they say) but a medly of their own device:
like as at this day there are still too many such folk in the world, who
would feign forge and build a kind of Religion after their own fashion,
taking a piece of the pure truth, and mingling many lies and dreams with it.
Lo how there have bin Neuters even from S. Paul's time hither. And now he
says, that be yielded not too them so much as one minute in way of
subjection, too the end that the liberty of the Gospel might continue in his
full force. That is in effect the thing that is rehearced here. And first of
all we have too arm our selves against the household enemies, which labor too
turmoyle and trouble the doctrine of the Gospel in such wise, as it may become
like a misshapen thing, and men may not discern any more of it. But let us
not be abashed when it happens so: for it is no novelty at all* Wherefore
let us understand, that as it was Gods will too try the constancy of the
faithful in S. Paul's time: so it is good reason that we also should be
tried in these days, 1. Cor. 11. d. 1^.
according as it is said, that it is necessary that there should be sects
and heresies, too the intent that they which have taken deep root might be
known by continuyng in their obedience to Godward, and bear their mark that
men may know them to have profited truly in the school of our Lord Jesus
Christ, for that they have not suffered themselves too be misledde or thrust
out of the way. That therefore is the cause why our Lord does always suffer
some troublers to sow darnell seed, and too labor too turn the pure
doctrine vpside down. He could well let it if he thought good: but he
gives Satan the bridle, that our faith may be the better tried. Although we
see occasions before our eyes, yet let us not swerve one way nor other, but
keep on still in the way that is showed us, assuring our selves that we
cannot do amiss in resting wholly upon Gods word. Then if we stand too
that, it is a good trial of our faith. Furthermore let us fight against such
dogs, knowing that they be deadly plagues, and do much more harm than they
that leap quyte out of their sockets, and show themselves manifestly too be
despyzers of the Gospel. Those then that are intermedled among us are the
worser sort, and it stands us on hand too resist them manfully. For if we
shrink from them in the battle, surely we shall have so much the greater
confusion, and men shall not be able any more too put a difference between
white and black.

Thus ye see how it behooves us too behave our selves. And now let us
mark what kind of men Saint Paul has noted here. He says that they
were crept in as it were by stealth, too spy out the liberty which we have
in our Lord Jesus Christ. The liberty that he speaks of here, concerned
Ceremonies. For (as we have touched already, and shall more fully see again
hereafter) God had ordained many figures under the Law, too hold the Fathers
in hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, till he were come and showed too the
world. The Sacrifizes therefore with all their appendants and appurtenances,
and the Sanctuary with all that was in it, served because our Lord Jesus
Christ who is the truth and substance of those things, had not yet showed
himself. It was for the fathers too be led and guyded under such shadows.
Gal. 4. a. 1.
And that is the cause why Saint Paul will use the similitude of young
children that are under Tutors and gouerners. The ancient fathers therefore
took profit by keeping the Ceremonies of the Law: for thereby they were
always confirmed in the things that were promised concerning the Redeemer. And
for that cause also it is said, that the Sanctuary was made according too the
Pattern that Moses had seen in the Mount. Now, that Pattern was spirit^all,
that is too wit, [it was] our Lord Jesus Christ with his grace, which is
uttered too us by his means now adays in his Gospel. For in as much as our
Lord Jesus Christ is come intoo the world, he has made an end of those
shadows and figures. And therefore also the veyle of the Temple rent asunder
at his death, Math. 27. f. 51.
too show how it was Gods will too have the faithful come more familiarly unto
him. S. Paul says now, that we have liberty in our Lord Jesus Christ: and
that is, because we be no more subject too the bondage that lasted in the
time of the Law, according as he will hereafter take example of circumcision,
and as he treats of it in another place also too the Colossians. Coloss. 2.
c. ^3.
We then are circumcyzed, not by the hand of man, but by the woorking of
Jesus Christ in us through the power of his holy spirit. And in steed of the
circumcision that was ordained for the Jews, we have Baptime, which
witnesses the same thing unto us: namely that we must become new creatures
too dedicate our selves wholly too the seruis of God. And so we see that the
liberty or freedom which is purchaced too us by our Lord Jesus Christ, is
that the Ceremonies of the law are laid away, so as we be no more subject
nor bound unto them. Now at the first blush a man would think this were no
great thing. For what harm were it if we were first baptized, and by and by
after circumcyzed? Or if we knew that our Lord Jesus Christ only is the whole
perfection and accomplishment, and yet had the figures thereof still? First if
men should keep still the ceremonies as in the time of the law: the glory of
our Lord Jesus Christ should be diminished for it, according as it is said that
the law was given by Moses, but truth and grace were uttered too us in our
Lord Jesus Christ: John. 1. b. 17.
for so it is said in the first chapter of S. John. Therefore he should be
bereft of his honor, if we should not have the liberty that he has brought
us. And it behooves us to understand, that our state is better and more
excellent now adays, than was the state of the old fathers, because our Lord
Jesus Christ is given unto us, and in him we have all that was figured at that
time. So then, men do wrong to our Lord Jesus Christ, in keeping still the
ceremonies of the Law. That is one point. Again, for as much as he is named
the Son of righteousness, Mala 4 a 1.
we must not be led still as though there were but a spark of light: but we
must fasten our eyes upon the doctrine wherein our Lord Jesus Christ is showed
unto us, and wherein we may also behold him face to face, 2. Co. 3 d. 18
to come even unto God his father, as has been showed in the second too the
Corinthians. Moreover, if the ceremonies of the Law be considered without our
Lord Jesus Christ, that is to say, if they be separated from him: they bring as
it were a binding with them, Colo. 2. c, 14
and a record of condemnation and death upon men. And thereupon does S. Paul
stand in the second too the Colossians, where he says that our Lord Jesus
Christ has upon his Cross, torn asunder and blotted out the obligation or
handwriting that was against us. For if the Sacrifizes stood in force at this
day, we should see there that we be all in danger of eternal death before
God. And why so? The sleaing of the poor beasts was not for that they
themselves had deserved it, but to show unto men as it were in a lively
picture, that they were all worthy to perish. Then if the same continued yet
at this day, we should still stand bound under the same obligation of death.
But we be discharged of it, by our Lord Jesus Christ. Colo. 2. c. 15.
And that was the triumph of his death, as Saint Paul says. Thirdly the
ancient fathers knew that although the Law was given them, yet they obtained
such favor of freedom at Gods hand, that all their faults were forgiven them.
But if men should nowadayes be put to the necessity of keeping all the
ceremonies: it would be an intolerable yoke, as it is said in the.xv. of the
Acts: Act. 15. b. 10
For the case would not only concern ceremonies, but also the drowning of us
in despair. For is it possible for men to do the things which God commands
all men to do without any exception or release? No. For the thing that God
requires and demands, passes all our ability: and if we fail but in any
one point; we should be overwhelmed under the bu^then. Therefore for that
cause, this liberty is of such importance, as we cannot be sure of our
salvation, nor freely call upon God, except we know that we be no more
hilde under the yoke and bondage of the Law. There is yet one point more which
shall be laid out at length: which is, that such as would needs make the
faithful subject to the keeping of ceremonies, had therewithal a wicked and
untoward imagination, that men were justified and did purchase grace at Gods
hand by such means. And that was an utter abolishing of the force of the death
and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now then, we see it was not causeless
that S. Paul strove so stoutly against the ceremonies of the law, to the end
they should not be so brought in use again, that the faithful should be hilde
in bondage under them. And we have need to be warned thereof: for in these
days we have the like encounter against the Papists. True it is that the
Papists have less color than had the deceyuers of whom S. Paul speaks. For
although they were Satan's underlings, and sought nothing but to pervert the
truth of the Gospel, yet had they at least wise this color, that they
brought not in their own dreams and traditions, but alleged the authority
of God, how that the law ought to be kept, and that was a meetely apparent
excuse. But the Papists have no such foundation: For all their Ceremonies are
forgeries of man's brain. It is true that they have mingled Iewishnesse with
them, and made such a galimaufrey as a man can not tell of whom they have
borrowed most. But howsoever the world go, yet are the Ceremonies of men's
setting up, which are at this day in the Popedom. Now when we strive to
abolishe them, they say we trouble the world for nothing. And then step in
these Neuters, which would feign please both parties, and make a Bastard
Gospel. Those fellows cast us in the teeth, that we be seditious, and that
through our preciseness we set much trouble in the world. And for proof
thereof (say they) is it meet that there should be such stryuing about
Ceremonies, seeing they be things indifferente? Yea forsoothe: For if God
would have the Ceremonies of the law (which yet notwithstanding came of him
and by his express commandment) too come too an end in our Lord Jesus
Christ: what shall we do when men will of their own foolish rashness set up
others in their stead? Seeing that God would have his own abolished, why
should men step forth thereupon, and bring in their own device, and make God
believe that he was not well advised? See ye not a cursed blasphemy? Now we
know that the cause why God would have the Ceremonies of his law abolished
in these days, was to the intent that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
should be the more lightsome and better known. Mal. 4. a. 2
For he is the daysunne of righteousness. Therefore all those shadows must
cease, and it is he in who^ we have the body and substance of them, Co. l2. c.
17.
says S. Paul. Seeing then that God had that respect and reason: the figures
must pass and vanishe away. But now what reason will the Papists bring, when as
men perceive by eyesight, that all their Ceremonies are a burying of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and yet that they bind men to the keeping of them under pain of
deadly sin? And furthermore when as in all their Ceremonies, they have a
certain opinion, that Baptism is not enough for them, but that they must have
holiwater to christen or baptize men evening and morning: and finally, that
when they have brought in all their pelting trash, and al their gewgawes, there
must always be somewhat in the^ to draw poor souls into bondage: is it to be
borne withal? On the other side, we see there is so straight a yoke, as it is
able to strangle the poor wretches. For the seely souls are bereft of the
freedom that was purchased for them by the death and passion of our Lord Jesus
Christ. We see the^ how it is not without urgent cause, yea and extreme
necessity, that we strive against the Popish tyranny about ceremonies,
considering that our Lord Jesus Christ has not his deserved pre-eminence, so
long as men busy their wits about those small trifles, and that moreover their
wretched consciences are always in unquietness without end or ceassing: and
finally, that on the otherside the Papists think to deserve grace by the
things which they term Gods service, bearing themselves in hand, that that is
the mean whereby men should become righteous to obtain salvation. So the^ we
see that S. Paul in his time was driven to susteyn that strife. And forasmuch
as our case is altogether like at this day, so as we cannot hold our peace
except we will betray both god and man: we must fight stoutly against that
hellish tyranny, and against those pelting trash trumperie and illusions of
Satan, whereby he would feign either quite deface the Gospel, or else so
turmoyle it as a man should not know which is the pure truth. This in effect
is the thing that we have to bear in mind. And whereas S. Paul says, that
he yielded not one jot too such men: it is too confirm us so much the better
on the thing that I touched even now. Peace and friendship are an amiable
thing among men. They be so indeed, and we ought to seek them to the
uttermost of our power. But yet for all that, we must set such store by Gods
truth, that if all the world should be set on fire for the mayntenaunce
thereof, we should not stick at it. As much as we can possibly, let us
purchase peace: and if the matter concern but our own persons or goods, let
us endeavor too compound with our adversaries, let us bear with them, and let
us labor to overcome them by our patience: Lo in what manner we ought to buy
peace. But yet in the mean while let not Gods truth be deminished, nor sustein
any harm or prejudice. For the peace that men seek among themselves shall
evermore be accursed, if God be not therewithal acknowledged and magnified as
he ought to be, and his word also continue vnimpeached, for that is the knot of
our bond: and if we intend to have it acceptable to God, and the end of it to
be good and for our welfare, surely God must knit us together. And he has
given us his Son, Ephesians. 2 c. 14
who is called our peace, too the end we should all of us fall in order under
him. Then if we mind to have good and holy peace, let us ame us at this mark
of yielding our selves under the obeisance of Gods son, that he may be our
head and we his body, like as there is but one Church. But if any man go about
too withdraw us from our Lord Jesus Christ: let us rather bear all the hatred,
outrages, and madness of the world, than to seek such agreement. And let us
not be afraid of all the reproach that can be done unto us according as
nowadayes we shall be falsely slaundered as stirrers up of many strifes. yea
verily, but what can we do with it? For it behooves us to abide still in the
truth of the Gospel, or else woe be unto us. If the Papists will not agree
with us, but be utterly wilful in the stubbornness that is seen too be in
them: we must be contented to be at defiance with men, seeing they purpose
too turn us from the peace which we should have with God by the means of his
Son, who not without cause bears that title as I told you before. Therefore
when they cry out upon us, we must be fenced with this answer of Elias which
he made unto Achab. Art not thou he (said Achab) that troublest Israel? 3.
Kings. 18. c. 17.
For the Prophet was accused (as we be nowadayes) because he labored to bring
the people back again too the pureness of the Law, and fought against the
supersticions and Idolatries that had bin devised: [by reason wherof] the king
thought verily that Elias had been come to make trouble sedition, and vprores,
according as the princes of this world could find in their hearts always to
welter in their own filth, and pass not of the serving and honoring of God,
but al is one to them [what come of it] so they may be maynteined in their
state. But the Prophet answered him, saying: [It is not I,] but it is thou and
thy fathers house. For they that will not agree unto God, nor hold themselves to
his service in such wise as he has appointed it in his word: they [say I] are
the troublers of the world, and the parties that ought to be blamed for all the
vprores, variances, and debates that happen. For (as I have showed already) it
is no reason that God should be robbed of his right, when men seek to knit
themselves together. Ye see then in effect what we have to think upon, when S.
Paul says that he would not yield one minute as in way of subjection, to such
as wownd in themselves after that fashion under false colors, to make a
bastard Gospel full of minglemangles and corruptions: for Gods truth is the
thing that was to be known first of all. Furthermore let us not be afraid of
the slander that is laid upon us [in telling vs] that it is pride and
presumption when we will not submit our selves: like as nowadayes the thing
that the Papists allege against us, is that we seem to take upon us to be
wiser than all the world, and that it is a great pride in us, that we cannot
find in our hearts too submit our selves too the common fashyon. True it is
that the title of obedience is amiable, like as I said even now of peace: but
yet must God be obeyed first of all. For if we will openly spyte God, and
play mockeholyday with him too the intent too submit our selves unto men,
and bow down our neck too bear their yoke, and in the mean while give no
audience unto God: what shall become of it? Surely we can not frame our selves
to the Papists in way of subjection or yielding to them; but God must be
thrust out of doors, and his word as it were trodden under foot, so as it
shall have another authority nor reverence amongst us. What is it that the
Papists would have us to do? That we should leave Gods word, and give over our
Lord Jesus Christ, and yet in the mean while receive all that ever they have
devised. They will not say in flat terms that God shall be spoiled of his
honor, nor that Jesus Christ shall have no more authority among them, they
will not speak so with open mouth, but yet it is so in deed. Like as these
deceyuers against whom S. Paul strove, made fair protestations inow that they
meant to be Christians, but yet for all that he was feign to come to the
touchstone, and to examine all things thoroughly. Now would the Papists have
their traditions received: and what manner of things are they? We see that our
Lord Jesus Christ is as good as buried there, as I have showed already.
Again, there is nothing but corruption in them: the things that are contained
under them are utter illusions of Satan, tending al to this end, that there may
be no more any certentie, nor any man know whereunto to stick. Seeing it is
so, it is not for us to make war against God, that men might be obeyed. And
therefore let us have as it were a forehead of brass to resist them in that
behalf. For the greatest manliness that can be, is to keep our selves from
swaruing aside for men's sakes, what color or fair show soever be set upon the
matter, and to despise every whit of it as dung and filth, when it stands
upon reserving Gods souereintie unto him, and upon giving ear to our Lord
Jesus Christ, to the end that he may be our head, and govern us, and all of
us from the most to the least continue under his guiding, and do nothing else
but simply give ear unto him, and receive the things that are for our
maintenance in the faith of the Gospel. Ye see then what we have too
remember here concerning S. Paul. Surely if ye seek a meeld and
meeke-spirited man, S. Paul was he, yea and he was even as a myrrour of all
courtesy and gentleness. Again, if ye desire a lowely nature, what greater
lowelynesse can there be found than was in S. Paul, who abaced him self
beneath all men. And yet notwithstanding we see how he strove for the pure
doctrine of the Gospel, and passed not to provoke the wrath of all the men in
the world against him self: in so much that it was cast in his teeth, that
all the troubles which happened in the Church of Galatia, and else where,
came of him. I say he feared not the reproach wherewith men could charge him,
that he was a rebel and had too much presumptuousnesse in him. Even so must
we do in these days. Let us be peaceable as near as we can: let us relent
of our own right: let us not strive for these worldly goods, honor, and
reputation: let us bear all wrongs and outrages, rather than be moved to any
debate through our own fault. But in the mean while, let us fight for Gods
truth with toothe and nail* Again, if any body despise us, so as one
steppeth up maliciously against us, and another goes about to deface us: let us
not make any quarrel at all for that. But if any man will draw us from the
obeying of our God, to make us stoop to the tirannie of men* Let us hold our
own in that case, let us withstand him stoutly to the uttermost, and let us
defy all the loftiness of the world, to the end that our lord Jesus Christ be
not diminished, but may alwais reign over us, and we be subject unto him. Thus
ye see in effect how we ought to put this text in practice, and also how the
necessity of the time ought to stir us thereunto. For now a days we be
not only persecuted, so as we see the fyres kindled too murder the poor
servants of God: but also are feign to be accused and condemned as seditious
persons, by those slaves that are in wages with Antichrist, to overthrow the
truth of the Gospel. Moreover they say there is nothing but pride in us,
because we will not receive their traditions. Well then, do they slander us
so furiously? Let us bear it patiently, and let them rail their fill (as S.
Paul says) so our quarrel be always to stand for our part in the pure
truth of the Gospel, and to withstand the Creatures that will not suffer
Christ alone too reign, and all knees too bow before him, and all men to do
him homage. Now as touching that which S. Paul speaks of the truth of the
Gospel, it a very notable saying, and which imports a very profitable
doctrine. For he might well have said simply, to the end that the gospel might
abide among you, I would not give place too them so much as one minute. But he
speaks of the truth of the Gospel: Howbeit, not that there is one true, and
another false: but when he says that the Gospel should continue true, he
speaks it in respect of men. And why so? For although men make a fair show
to be Christians: yet do they always labor to have some medly, according as
we see many geerish heads in this world, who cannot abide that God alone should
govern us, but every man would cast in his own collop or morsel, and thereof
came the confusion that is at this day in the papacy. A man would wonder how
so many pelting gewgaws, fools bables, yea and also gross abominations could
be gathered together. But that is come to pass because that men were not
contented to obey God, but would needs add this and that of their own fancy.
So then, S. Paul speaks here purposely of the truth of the Gospel, as he
speaks of the simplicity of our Lord Jesus in the second to the Corinthians.
2. Cor. 11. a 3.
And what is meant by the simplicity [or singlenesse] of our Lord Jesus
Christ? It is matched against all the minglings that men make. For (as I have
said already) they have a foolish fancy of setting forth things devised of
their own brain. Now when men do so put too things of their own: it is but
corruptnesse and stark abomination. And that is the cause why S. Paul faith,
that we must hold still the singleness of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore
when under color of handling the Gospel, men go about to make a patched and
pydecoted or motley religion (as a man might term it:) it is no more a true
religion, but there is much falshod mingled with it. Then let us mark well, that
whereas S. Paul uses here such speech, he (or rather the holyghost by his
mouth) warns us that it is not enough for us to bear the name of Christians,
and to make some fair show of cleaving to Gods word and to the doctrine of our
Lord Jesus Christ: but that we must stick to it thoroughly, and take heed that
we another mingle nor foyst in any thing to it, but consider that like as a
little leven is able to sower a great deal of dow, so al will be marred, as soon as we give any entrance to the things that men have deuized of their own heads.
To be short, the means to keep the doctrine of the Gospel pure, is that men
add not any thing at all to it, nor be so bold and licentious, as too lay
one thing or other upon it, but too content themselves with the things that
our lord Jesus Christ has showed us, so as we become his true disciples, and
be not so hardy as too reply against him, but that all mouths may be shet,
and no man lift up his neb too say, this is my opinion, this think I to be
good, but every one of us receive simply that which is taught us by our Lord
Jesus Christ, who has all dominion of reigning over our souls. Lo how we may
have the truth of the Gospel: And it beehoueth us so much the more too
practyse this doctrine, of S. Paul's, by cause we see that nowadayes many men
seek nothing but to mingle one with an other, so as they care not of what
religion they be, so the same be most tolerable and easlyest received of the
world. True it is that among the Papists many be so wilful, as they will
never abide that a man should varye one point from them. For they see well,
that if there be never so little a breach made, by and by all their tyranny
decays and falls down to the ground. For what hold have they but by
tyranny and violence, too tell us that we must neither will nor choose, but
take it for good? Those therefore that are flatly on the popes side, would have
men too hold through out, all the filthiness and abominations which they
have had hithertoo. But there are a sort of fantastical heads, which would
have a Reformation, wherein the Pope and Mahumet and Jesus Christ should be
mingled toogither, so as men might no more discern which is which: for all
is one to them so the world be agreed upon it: They bear no reverence at all
unto God, and that is the cause why all things have been so turmoyled and
confounded in our days, and the very foundation, whereupon the Interim (as
they term it) was grounded. For seeing that many men could not find in their
hearts to consent to Papistrie: they thought it good too have a reformation
between both. And even at this day a great sort inclyne still to the like
reformation. It is true (say they) that there are abuses, and it were meet they
should be mended. Yea, but their meening is but too pluck away some leaf or
little branch, and too let the rest alone, that the root root might grow
still: that is too say, that the Gospel of God might be defaced with all manner
of superstitions that reign in the Popedom. But what for that? here the holy
Ghost condemns all such neuters, and shows that their doings are but
crafts of Satan, yea and mere illusions and mockeries to lead silly souls
to destruction, and moreover also a defacing of the glory of our Lord Jesus
Christ. And why? For we have not the Gospel at all, except we have the pure
truth, whereunto it may not be lawful for men to add any thing, but all of
us to hold our selves to that which is showed us by our master. Ye see then,
how that in these days we be enforced by the necessity of the time, to put
this doctrine in ure. And therefore when Gods enemies vpbrayde us that we will
not agree with them, let us always allege for our excuse, that our agreement
is to be knit together in our Lord Jesus Christ, and to be all obedient too
his word and doctrine. If they allege that it is a pride in us to reject so
the things that are commanded by such men as term themselves superiors. Let us
answer that we must first obey God, and that Jesus Christ must not be bereft of
his right, and men set up in his place. If they ask why so? Were it not
better to have some mean way, and that every man should show how he intends
not too separate himself from the rest, than to strive after that fashion, and
to cause christendom to be as it were scattered? Let us answer that the
matter stands not upon knowing who shall get the upper hand, or who shall be
master over his fellows: but Gods word must continue always vnimpeached, or
otherwise all the pretense of concord, that men can make, shall be but
abomination before God. And why? For it were better that all things should go
to havoc and confusion in the world, than to abide that Gods word (being so
precious and holy a thing as it is) should in any wise be perverted: yea it
were better that heaven and earth should be confounded together [than that that
should be suffered.]

So then let us consider well this doctrine, how it may serve our turn and
do us good, not only to beat back all the assaults that shall be put too
us by the enemies of Gods truth, but also too frame us too all lowlynesse and
modesty, so as our whole desire may be too be guyded and governed by Gods
word, and by the doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ. Howbeeit, therewithal,
let us be so stout hearted, as not to be turned away by men, neither for
their credit and authority, nor for their threatenyngs, nor for all the pride
and stateliness of the world, but that we may always stick steadfastly to
our Lord Jesus Christ. And if any body come and lay any new thing before
us, let us e^ermore have a good eye too the end wherevntoo they would lead
us, and [consyder] that like as Satan has many wiles and policies, so also
have his underlings too. [And therfore] let us on our side have the skill to
look to our selves in such wise as we may always know our Lord Jesus Christ,
and be guyded thither, so as he may be our only mark and shoot anchor, and we
understand that he has all fullness of welfare in him, to the end that we
should seek our wantes in him, and all things be put away that might hinder us
from coming unto him.

And now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God with
acknowledgemente of our faults, praying him too make us feel them in such
wise, as we may crave forgiveness of them at his hand with true repentance,
and profit after such sort more and more in his word, as it may make us too
forsake our selves, and lean unto him and his power, that he may hold us up
in our fraylenesse, till he have brought us to the perfection whereunto he
calls us at this day. And so let us all say, Almighty God our heavenly
father. etc.

The ninth Sermon which is the third upon the second Chapter.
6. But as for those that are in estimation, (I pass not what they have bin
in time past: for God regards not the outvvard appearance of man) surely those
that were in estimation did add nothing unto me.

7* But co^traryvvise when they savv that the preaching of the Gospel to the
uncircumcised was committed unto me, as the preaching to the circumcysed was
committed unto Peter:

8 (For he that was of power in Peter's Apostleship toward the
Circumcizion, was of power in me also toward the Gentiles.)


WE saw this morning, that when me^ mingle their own fancies with Gods truth,
there is nothing but corruption, and by that means the Gospel is falsified.
Which thing ought to hold us in such awe, as no man should presume to add
aught at all to the things that we have from above. For God has taught us so
perfectly, as we can not put too any thing without great blasphemy, forasmuch
as it were a covert accusing of him of unadvisedness, or else of nigardship, as
who should say he were loath too bestow things upon us which would be for our
welfare: Seeing then that the doctrine of the Gospel is sufficient for us, let
us abide in it. And if any man step up to bring in some addition of his own,
let us abhor it, yea though the thing seem to have never so great reason in it,
as oftentimes the devil uses to shroude himself under this covert, that we
must not stick at light and slender points. But [surely] God must be hearkened
too in all points and al respects* according as it is to be demed by S. Paul's
doing, who could easyly have let slip the circumcizing of Titus as a small
thing, and yet notwithstanding would not be^d in that behalf: the reason whereof
was, least the Gentiles should be made subject to such necessity as was
intended to be laid upon the^. Yet we read that he sticked not to circumcise
Timothy. Nevertheless the matter seemed to be all one, and that S. Paul used
inconstancy and variableness in that behalf. Behold, there were two
Heathen men which had not bin nourished and instructed in the law of Moses
from their birth. And the Jews would never have received any man that had not
ben circumcized. For they deemed all men to be unclean which bare not that
warrant about them.

Now S. Paul circumcyseth the one, Act. 16. a. 3*
and will not do the like to the other, who will think that he kept an even
hand? If we consider all things well, we shall see why he refuzed to
circumcyse Titus, and yet had circumcysed Timothy. Circumcision was at that
time lawful of it self. It was not like the Idolatries that are in Papistrie
nowadayes. If ye ask what holywater is, it is an unhallowing of baptism. For
in baptim we have a washing that ought to suffice us both in life and death,
and God will not have us too have any other warrant of the spiritual clenzing
that was obtained for us by the blud of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we must be
contented with it. But as for the Holywater of the Papists, what else is it
than an endless baptysing of our selves? As touching the Mass, it is so
vilanous and outrageous a treachery, that noman can come at it, but he must
defyle himself by renouncing the death of our Lord Jesus Christ. But
Circumcision stood not in the like case: for it was profitable for the time
that it lasted. True it is that it was abolished at the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ: but yet for all that, the Jews might keep it still till they
were fully instructed in the liberty of the Gospel. Saint Paul therefore had
circumcised Timothy: and the reason why, was for that he saw many
weaklings, which would have been offended because they were not yet thoroughly
confirmed in the knowledge of the Gospel, but thought that it behooved them to
keep still the ceremonies of the Law. And it is said, that we must yield one
to an other, for charity byndeth us thereunto. Every man must not do what he
him self thinks good, to the trubbling of his neybours: but we must so fashyon
our selves one too an other, as none may be offended through our fault. S*
Paul then forbear in having respect too the poor Ignorant weaklings, who not
withstanding might be brought to knowledge in time. And as concerning the
person of Titus, he saw how men went about to lay a yoke of bondage upon the
Gentiles, and that the same would be a holding of the Jews always under the
Law, which was then but superstition. For it was for them to have known that
the law had served out his time, and that the ceremonies should not continue
for ever. If this had not bin made plain, the Jews had been hardened in a wrong
opinion, and the Gentiles had received a yoke of bondage: and therefore Paul
made resistance against it. And so we see it is not only lawful, but also
needful to use things dyuersly which are another good nor bad of their own
nature. As for example, if we see a man drawn back from coming to the Gospel,
or troubled, because he is not yet well strengthened: it becomes us to
forbear the thing that else were lawful for us, according as we have seen
heretofore, that we must always have regard what is expedient and fit for
every man's salvation. But if we see that under color that a thing is neither
good nor badde, men go about to interlace some holiness with it, and to bind
men's consciences by constrainyng them to keep it: there we must withstand
them to the uttermost. As for example, To eat flesh or fyshe is a thing
indifferent, as they term it, for it is neither forbidden nor bidden of God
too eat flesh. Now if some ignorant person be offended at the eating thereof,
and thynk it to be deadly sin, because he knows not whether [the forbearing
of] it be a tradition of the Pope, or a commandment of God, till he be
taught it* we must eschew offense. Yea and when we have to do with any Jews,
which are not acquaynted with our customs, and that we go about to win them
and draw them to the obedience of the Gospel: we must for a ^yme (in being
co^uersant with them) abstein from the things which they think to be
forefended. For inasmuche as they are armed with the authority of God, they
would think they had some reason to condemn us, if it were not showed them
before, how and by what warrant we might eat of all meats indifferently, and
without exception. But contrariwise, if the Papists would bring us to this
point, that we should continually forbear the eating of flesh upon Frydays
and Saterdays, and in Lentseason, and upon other days of their appoynting:
which soever of us should agree too that, he were a traitor too the Gospel,
and we should rather die a hundred times. For why? we must keep the liberty
that is purchased for us by our Lord Jesus Christ. If it be said, and how
so? Ought a man too trouble the whole world, and too be so wylfull for a
little liquorousnesse of eating flesh? The question is not whether a man
should eat flesh or no: but whether God ought too be obeyed and the thing
used which he permits, or whether we should rest upon the fancies of men.

Now if a thing be lawful for me by Gods word, is it to be condemned because
men judge of it after their own fashion and guize? But we see that Gods
authority is blemished when the right that belongs to him, and is reserved
only to himself, is given too mortal creatures. Again, there is a clog
laid upon men's consciences, insomuche that our Lord Jesus Christ is
defrauded of his due honor. For if he have purchased us such liberty as to
set us free from the ceremonies of the law: it is much more reason (as I
told you this morning) that the things which men have devised should be laid
away, and abolished. Wherefore let us mark well that in all indifferent things
we must have regard to edifying, and although it be lawful for us either too
use or to forbear a thing: yet Charity byndeth us one to an other. It is a
willing seruisablenesse when for the edifying of our neighbors we absteyn
from the thing which is free for us to do. But yet in the mean while, we must
not under the shadow of peace and concord betray Gods truth, and make a myngle
mangle of it, so as men may not know who ought too rule the roast here
beneath, nor what law is too be followed, but we must utterly mainteyne the
liberty whereof Saint Paul speaks here. Lo what we have in effect to
hold us too.

Now he adedth immediately, that the Apostles which were in great estimation,
brought nothing unto him, (And he vppeneth here Peter, John, and James, who
were had in great reputation above the rest, as pillars,) but only took in
good woorthe, and allowed the doctrine which he had taught theretoofore.
And therewythall he adds, That ^ee passed not what opinyon men had of
Peter, John, and James, for as much as God regards not any man's person*
That is too say, his outward show or estimation too the worldewarde.

It should seem here at the first blushe, that S. Paul strives for himself,
and for his own authority and credit. There were dogs that barked against him
in times past, and specially the ba^ksliders that had tasted of the Gospel: who
to pretend some color of their backsliding and of their renouncing of Christ,
alleged thus for themselves. Tushe it is well enough known, that the Apostles
strove to wit who should be greatest, which was an unseemly thing, and showed
well that they had ill borne away their masters doctrine, who commanded them
to humble themselves in such wise, that every of them should make himself
least, although he were the greatest. But we have to mark here, that S. Paul
had no controversy with the Apostles, as he himself also declares. Therefore
there is some special cause why he magnifieth himself so much: which is, for
that those dogs which labored to set debate between the Apostles, and
therwithall to turmoyle and falsify the Gospel, pretended always too be the
disciples of the Apostles and familiar with them, like as in these days we see
many fugitives and shameless fellows* which abuse the names of Gods
servants, and pass not to lie with open throat, saying: Oho, I learned it of
such a man. And yet they speak of a matter that was never heard of, yea and
their shamelesnes ouershooteth it self so far as to name the very cities, when
as notwithstanding, if a man examine them thoroughly, he shall find the clean
contrary. So then it was for S. Paul to show that the authority of men is
not sufficient to deface the sovereign authority of our Lord Jesus Christ,
nor the reverence that men ought to bear to his word. Therefore we see first
of all, that Paul strove not here against Peter, James, or John, for he agreed
very well with them. And secondly that he regarded not his own person, but
meant to maynteine Gods case: that is too wit, that he was ordained and
established in the state of an Apostle* Mark for one point that he did not
thruste himself in upon a bravery nor at adventure, but that God had chosen
him thereunto, and that thervppon, he had so borne abroad the doctrine that was
betaken unto him as the pure truth of God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Wherefore if we consider whereat S. Paul amed, we shall not only have wherewith
to stop the mouths of all misspeakers, but also be the more confirmed in the
faith which we hold by his teaching. And although there be not nowadayes any
such shameless persons that labor to deface him, or to abolish the authority
of his Apostleship: yet does not that doctrine cesse to be for our profit. As
how? We have seen already how Saint Paul has said, that if the Angels
of Heaven should step up too preach a Gospel contrary to the Gospel of
our Lord Jesus Christ: we should hold them accursed. And even at this day the
same is good for us. For we may defy Satan, and all the misbeleefe and
wiliness of men, and all the trashe and subtileties which they have to
thrust us from the singleness of our faith: I say we may defy euerywhit of
it. And why? For Gods word has such a Majesty in it self, that all things
that can be set up against it, are but smoke, leazing, and filthiness. Now
then if we take it for a general rule, that another Peter nor John may
diminishe the Majesty of the Gospel: it will serve us for a buckler too ward
all things that can be alleged in these days too shake us withal: according
also as we see, that diverse weakelings are thrust out of the way by that it
is said unto them, how now? we see that the wyzest men of the world,
the men of greatest skill, the Prelates and such as have the government of
the Church, toogither with the Kings and Princes, stick too the faith that
has bin received of long time, and too the old accustomed manner of living.
Thus the poorer sort have their eyes bleared, and their wits utterly dulled,
and their hearts discouraged, by means whereof Gods truth is forsaken, so as
it has another credit nor reverence among them, and in the mean season these
maskers get the upper hand, and flaunt it, as who would say, that men
should make Idolles of them, and woorship them in despyte of God. Then since it
is so, we see it stands us on hand in these days, too be armed with the
doctrine that is contained here in Saint Paul: which is, that God will have
us too receive his word without gaynesaying: and that when our Lord Jesus
Christ came down intoo the world, he was ordained too be our Master, with
condition that every of us should harken too him, and stick too the things
that he speaks, without adding aught too, or diminishing aught from that
which it pleased him too show, because the full perfection of all wisdom is
in him. When we once know this, we may despyze all the gewgawes that men
can lay before us. And if men tell us that the greatest men, the wyzest men,
the richest men, and the men of authority of this world do live so or so:
[^ee may answer,] yea marie, but when all comes too all, what are they in
comparison of God? When creatures come before him they must all vanishe away:
for when soever there is that Majesty given too Gods word, whereby he
intends too try whither we honor him or no: it is certain that we will
receive all that proceeds out of his holy mouth. Now, that word is
contained in the Gospel, in so much that when we have once granted that God
is too be obeyed, we must no more run over sea or land too seek what his
will is: for we have a sure and infa^lible warrant of it in the Law,
Prophets, and Gospel. Since the case stands so, we see it is not without
cause that the holy Ghost would have this doctrine too continue too the
worlds end. And furthermore we be warned therewithal, too rest upon God
without wavering at every blast of wind, according as we see how the Devil
stirs up much variety of opinions, which are as whirlewindes and tempests
too drive us too and fro.

But let us learn too be settled upon God, and then shall we stand out too
the last brunt. For if we hilde our faith of John; or Peter, it would be
but a lean faith, because they were frail creatures, and we know that man
is subject too leasings and vanity. Therefore it stands us on hand, too have
a much substantialler and surer groundwoorke and foundation, than all that is
too be found in this world. And so, for as much as we know that God has
taught us in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that men have bin no
more but the instruments thereof: it behooves us too mount up unto God. That is
the way for us too apply this doctrine too our own instruction, where Saint
Paul says that the Apostles added not any thing unto him. Never the later,
it is not meant that he de^pyzeth them, or that he intended not to profit with
them: for he liked very well of that, yea and employed himself by all means
thereunto, and hild no skorne too be taught even of the meanest sort, as we
have seen. But his intent was that Gods word which he had preached should
abide firm: and thereupon he puts the wisest men in subjection too it, and
the men of greatest countenance in the world, and such as bare greatest show
and reputation in the Church, to the end that Jesus Christ should keep his
pre-eminence still, and men have an eye unto him, and not unto men, but ground
themselves altogether upon one selfsame faith, and say that for as much as the
Son of God is sent unto us to show us the will of God his father: it is not
lawful for us in any wyze too doubt of the thing which we receive of him.
Thus ye see what we have too do at this day. And whereas Saint Paul
says, that he passes not what the Apostles were, because God regards not
men's persons: thereby he shows that he ought not too be counted inferior
too John or Peter, for that he had bin an infidel, and not believed in Jesus
Christ, at such time as the other Apostles did already preach the Gospel. For
the manner of the world is, that they which come first, should be first
served. Saint Paul therefore perceiving that the same might be some
prejudice too his doctrine, says that men must not look what a one he had
bin before, or what the other had bin before. And yet his meening is not, that he
ought not too look back too humble himself continually, or that the gifts
of grace which God had bestowed upon John and Peter, should not be esteemed
and commended as they were praise worthy: 1. Cor. 15. a. 8. 9.
for we see that in other places he terms himself a poor thing borne out of
time, and confesses himself too be unworthy to be counted in the number of
the Apostles* Saint Paul then did not as a number of hypocrites or rather
shameless persons do, who all their life long have bin either whoremongers,
or drunkardes, or looce livers, and of a beastly conversation, and yet for all
that do but wring their mouth at it and say, tush, men must not inquyre what I
have bin. But surely men must not look too have any other judges [agaynst them
than themselves.] For every of us ought too condemn himself, as S. Paul
exhorts us: and specially when we consider how we have bin wretched
unbelievers, 1. Cor. 11. f. 28.
and as good as beasts, we ought too be ashamed of our own lewdness.
Saint Paul therefore wiste well there had bin cause for him too mislyke of
himself, and too be ashamed of his striving against the Gospel, and
therewithal disdeyned not the goodness that had bin in John and James. At
such time as Peter and John were scurged and whipped for the Gospel, Saint
Paul was a murderer, and passed not too say that they were rightly dealt
withal, and that it made no matter. But yet for all that, he ameth at the
mark which I spoke of before: namely that for as much as God had so advanced
him within a little while, his former misbehauiour in times paste ought not to
hinder the receiving of the gracious gifts that were in him, that they might
not profit too the common edifying of the Church.

Thus ye see in effect, that the thing which we have too bear in mind, is
that if it be late ere we be called too the Gospel, we must be sorry
that we have spent our time so ill, and specially that we have lived like
wretched brute beasts, without knowing who is our father too whom we ought too
do homage, both for our life and for all the goods which we have received of
him. Therefore we ought too be sorry for that. Again, when we see a man
return that was gone astray, we must acknowledge such change too be a
miracle of God. For if a man have bin a wild beast, and past all hope of being
brought unto God, and yet afterward becomes as a sheep, and submits
himself willingly too the obedience of our Lord Jesus Christ: it cannot be
but that the hand of God has passed upon him. Therefore it behooves us too
know what all men have bin aforetimes, and every man ought too be his own
judge in that behalf: but yet for all that, when a man has bin slow in
coming unto God, if God work in him with such power as it is seen that he
minds too set him forewarder in one day, than some other men in ten years:
his so doing must not cause us too pluck back him that was able too edify,
as men sometimes do, saying, what was such a one a two or three years ago?
such sayings are naught worth. Let us rather understand, that our Lord
has showed himself so much the more, too the end too be honored. And
therewithal, for as much as Gods gifts ought not too be unprofitable: let us
suffer them too be applied to the profit and welfare of the faithful. Ye
see then that our looking what men have bin aforetimes, must not be to despyze
them still: for it may be that God gave him the bridle for a time too the
intent too bring him down, so as he became an unthrift, or lived in ignorance,
and knew not goodness, or had not any excellent or commendable quality in
him: and yet for all that, God will set him as it were upon the scaffold,
and show by effect that he intends too be served by him. Therefore it
behooves us too take in good worth, the thing that God gives and offers
unto us in that wyze.

Thus ye see what we have to bear in mind, and how needful it is that we
should so do: for there is not any thing contained here, whereof we have not
the experience now adays. As touching the words where Saint Paul says
that God accepts not any man's person: it is all one as if he had said,
that God is not tied too the things that are seen of us, or which we have in
estimation, but that he is free too bestow his gifts on whom he lists, and
how he lists. Many men, when they here this word Person spoken of, do
beguyle themselves, and wrest it against the meeening of the holy Ghost. And
therevppon many men suppoze that God accepts not any one man more than
another, for then [thinke they] he should be partial. But see how they darken
Gods free Election: as who should say he were beholden too men, and that if
he choze any of them, the same ought too be general without exception, in so
much that (too their seemyng) Gods grace flies in the air like a Tennisball,
and it is in our power and free will too reach out our hand too catch it,
and too apply it too our use. Thus are diverse besotted, yea even with too
gross ignorance, because they understand not what is meant by the word
person. But the holy Scripture tells us, that God in voutchsafing too chooze
men, and too set them in a more excellent state, and too bestow the gifts
of his holy Spirit upon them, stays not upon any thing at all in the
party, ne passes whither he be white or black, old or young, noble or
unnoble, rich or poor, beloved or behated of men, fair or foul. God
thinks not upon any of these small tryfles: for if he should delay too love
us till he found some good thing in us: he should let us alone still in
such plight as we be. That therefore is the cause why Saint Paul says
expressly, that God regards not any man's person. And so we see now what
we have too gather upon that Text. First of all (as I have said already) let
us learn too receive Gods gifts, and too make our own profit of them when
they be offered us, and let us not take occasion too refuze them as many men
do, which labor too cloak their unkindness by alleging one thing or other.
But whither they allege antiquity, or what soever thing else, let it not
hinder us too take profit by those whom God sends too us: for though they
be not past three days old, nor can magnify themselves among men, nor have
done many exploytes and valiant enterpryzes: yet is it no matter too us, so we
perceive that our Lord has given them such gifts as may be auayleable too
our edification, and therefore let every of us stoop and become teachable,
assuring our selves that if we refuze the good that is offered us by man, we
do not wrong too the man, but for as much as God is the author thereof, and we
hold skorne too receive that which comes of him, we be worthy too be
utterly bereft of the thing that he is minded too bestow upon us, and of the
benefits which he has after a sort put intoo our hand. Lo what we have too
bear away. Furthermore let us learn also, not too bring any imaginacion of
self value when we come unto God. But let him that is noble, mighty, or
rich too the worldwarde, lay away all self estimation, and acknowledge it too
be utterly nothing before God: and let him that is poor and miserable,
assure himself that he is not quite shaken off, though men despyze him. Also
let us practyze that which is showed us by S. James, which is, that the brother
which is great and noble should glory in his smalnesse, knowing that he has
all things of Gods only mere goodness: and that the brother which is poor
and of low and mean degree, should glory in that God has adopted him, and
given him such a state as passes all the kingdoms of the world, seeing it
pleases him too auow us after that fashion for his children. True it is that
where as men gaze upon the outward appearance and fair show of things: God
accepts a good conscience, God looks at the vncorruptnesse of the heart. But
yet must he be feign too put the same before into it: for at the first he shall
not find it in us. Let God look upon all the children of Adam, Psa. 14. ^. 3.
and (as it is said in the Psalm) he shall fiude nothing but utter
corruption. They be stark rotten in their wickedness. See what our nature
is. Then is there not any thing that could move God too accept us, and too
prefer us before others: but we must become vessels of his goodness, and
acknowledge that his accepting of us, is not for our own worthiness: but
that when he choze us too himself, and set us intoo the way by his holy
spirit, even then he knew what soundness was in us. Not that we have any at
all of our own: but because he does as it were behold himself in us. For
look how many good things there are in the faithful, so many records are
there of Gods goodness in that he has showed himself bountiful toward
them. Act. 10. e. 34
That is the cause why that in the tenth of the Acts and in other places, this
accepting of persons is put for the deckings and vizors which are as false
illuzions: of which sort are riches, credit, dignity, nobility and such
other things, which serve too make men too set store by themselves, and too
stand in their own conceytes. 1. Sam. 16. b. 17.
But it is said that God doothe look into men's hearts, and not gaze upon
the outside of them, so they submit themselves too him obediently, as I have
declared already. This is in effect the thing that we have too bear in
mind. Now S. Paul adds immediately, that the Apostles auowed him too be
their fellow and gave him their hand, as it were too warrant that the Gospel
which he had preached, was in all points conformable to their doctrine, and
that all of them had served our Lord Jesus Christ. Hereunto S. Paul adds,
that he was by common consent received as the Apostle of the Gentyles* that is
too say, of such as had not bin brought up under the law, nor were Jews by
birthe and auncitrie. Here we see that S. Paul's stryuing was not with the
Apostles: for they auowed him too be their fellow: another did he disdain
them: for we have seen before, that although his coming to Jerusalem was
with assured knowledge that God had appointed him, and upon sure and
infallible revelation, after he had bin caught up intoo the third Heaven: yet
notwithstanding he was not carried with pride, another undertook he that
journey to Jerusalem, to common with the Apostles for fear least he had
already or should thereafter run in vain. For his desire was too have all
men know, that he chalendged not any special thing too himself, but that
his only seeking* was, that the Son of God might be published all the
world over, and that men should woorshippe him and rest upon him, so as he
brought not a new Jesus Christ, but was conformable in all points too Peter
and John, and too all their fellows. If Saint Paul had shrunk aside by
himself, it would have been said, that his meening was not too have any
consent of doctrine with the rest of the Apostles. But now, seeing he comes
after that sort too agree with them: he shows that he was not carried away
with any pride or presumptuousnesse: and that is it which he meeneth by saying
new again, that the Apostles auowed him too be their fellow* Then does he
not take upon him too be above them: but will have men know that the
Apostles served our Lord Jesus Christ, and that he was one of their number, and
that the Gospel which he had preached must not be taken as a doubtful
thing, but [as certaine] as if Peter or John had spoken it, in so much that when
Saint Paul treats thereof, he says not, it is I, but he says it is
Jesus Christ. VVhither it be Peter, John, or James that speaks, let us
look that the Son of God have ever the maysterhood above us, and let the
thing that comes of him be received, whither it be by me or by an other.
Saint Paul will not have men too gaze after him, any more than after the
least man in the world. The thing which we have in effect too remember in
this text of Saint Paul's, is that he had no mind at all of himself, ne
sought any whit of his own, but was contented that Jesus Christ should have
the praise that he deserved, and that his word should be received with all
reverence, and as for all other things, he cared not what became of them. As
touching the other point, that he was accepted for the Apostle of the Gentiles:
Act. 13. a. 2.
it is agreeable too that which Saint Luke also rehearceth: namely that Paul
and Barnabas were ordained Apostles, because God had sholed them out for the
same purpose, too preach the Gospel among the Gentyles. Then did not that
matter come of men: but God had pronounced his vnreuocable sentence of it:
and Saint Paul's treating after that sort of himself, does no whit diminish
the commission of the other Apostles. But seeing he was sent of God in deed,
and that his calling was not grounded upon men, nor he had preaced in
vnmeasurably, nor thrust himself in upon a geerishnesse, but was chosen
thereunto of God: the Apostles showed that they would not in any wise speak
against such a calling, because it was of sufficient authority, as coming
from God. And here we see yet better, how all men ought to frame themselves
to obedience, too the intent that nothing may let the word of God to be a
bridle and yoke, too hold us so in awe, as none of us may follow his own
fancies, lusts and affections, but suffer our selves to be guided and governed
by the hand of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now if it were not lawful for the
Apostles to refuze Saint Paul, because he was sent from heaven: what shall we
do? Shall it not be a devilish pride, if we cannot endure that the government
and order which God has stablished in his Church, should continue
vnimpeached, but would change callings at our own pleasure, to set up and
pull down according too the device of our own foolish brain? Then if we go
about too make such trouble in the Church, is it not all one as if we would
pluck the Sun out of the sky to spite God withal. Therefore ye see here,
that the thing which we have to bear in mind, is that the government of the
Church is ordained of God, and that they which go about to change any thing in
it, are full of devilish pride, and must in the end fall down for aduauncing
themselves in such wise. Now as touching that Saint Paul was sent among the
Gentiles: Mark. 16. ^. 15.
it was not an altering of that which had bin uttered already by the mouth of
our Lord Jesus Christ when he said, go preach ye the Gospel through the
whole world. It might seem at the first sight, that here was some change
and contrariety, in that S. Paul was sent on the one side, and Saint Peter on
the other. Nevertheless, both of them do stand very well together, for so much
as our Lord Jesus Christ spoke not severally to any one of the Apostles, Thou
Peter shall go over all the world, thou shall go about the whole earth to
preach my Gospel, or thou John shall do the like, and so consequently to the
others: but he says, All you whom I have ordained, go spread abroad my
Gospel every where. And his giving of Commission after that sort in general
terms, is no let but that one might go one way, and another another, and
every of them employ himself wheresoever God made him way, or gave him
entrance, according also as they labored to spend themselves thereaboutes,
as well in death as in life. But besides this, there was a special commission
given to Saint Paul to go into Countries further off, where there was not such
a multitude of Jews. True it is that wheresoever Paul came, he did put
forth the doctrine of the Gospel throughout all the Sinagoges of the Jews,
so as he was rightly their Apostle also. Howbeeit, this let him not to be
ordained for the Gentiles, and to carry abroad the Gospel through the whole
world, even where God had not bin known before, and where there had not been
any light of good doctrine, any law, or any Religion. S. Paul then was sent
chiefly unto them. And seeing it is so: what title of supremacy can the Pope
now pretend, under color that S. Peter (as he himself says) was Bishop of
Rome? Surely the saying that Peter was at Rome, and lived as Bishop there, is
but a fable and flat mockery. But let us put the case it were so. Yet
according to that which I have said already, Peter's calling was specially for
the Jews. And therefore if the Pope pretend too be Saint Peter's successor,
he must be the Bishop of the Jews, and his supremacy must stretch no
further than too them. For as for Saint Paul, it is very certain that he was
never Bishop of Rome, nor never was there, saving when he was brought prisoner
thither: and it is not known whither he continued there or no, howbeeit it is
very likely that he answered for his life. The Pope then cannot brag that he
succedeth Saint Paul therein. And what warrant has the City of Rome, or what
worthiness can it pretend to say that the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ
were there: but that it is a den of thieves, and that Gods servants have bin
murdered there? So then let us mark well this Text, where Saint Paul shows,
that Saint Peter was appointed for the Jews, and himself sent too the
Gentiles: for in as much as this lesson serves expressly for our turn, we
ought too be the more moved too profit by it. True it is that the doctrine of
the other Apostles belongs to us as well as this, for our Lord Jesus Christ
will be heard when he speaks to us, whither it be by the mouth of Peter, or
by the mouth of John, for all are instruments of his spirit, and we must not
make a difference betwixt persons. But howsoever the case stand, for as much
as S. Paul's doctrine concerns us, it ought too serve us as a spur to
prick us to the quick. And forasmuch as God choze him to bring the wretched
Gentiles unto him, making him the mean to draw those unto him which had bin
cut off from his Church: surely it ought to give us the more courage, seeing he
did his endeavor to draw the wretched unbelievers out of the darkness of
ignorance wherein they were, (making that his only mark to shoot at) that is
too wit, us that come not of the race of the Jews as concerning the flesh.
Nevertheless, let us consider therewithal, that Jesus Christ will be heard
of us in such wise, as we must not regard either Peter or Paul, or James or
John, or any thing else but him. Let us hold us contented with the master
that is given us of God the father too bring us too all perfection and
wisdom, and let us also suffer our selves too be taught by such means as
he lysteth, and let the things that Saint Paul has written serve us, and
likewise the wrytings of John and of James, and of the rest of the Apostles: so
they lead us too Jesus Christ, let us receive whatsoever is brought us by
them, and let us shet our eyes at all other things, and not have any other
consideration, than our Lord Jesus Christ calls us by their means. And
although we follow the guiding of the doctrine of Peter, John, James, and
Paul: yet let our shooteanker always be too be joined and united too our
Lord Jesus Christ, in whom we shall find the fullness of all welfare and
joy, so as we shall have where of too glory thoroughly in him.

But let us offer our selves before the majesty of our good God, with
acknowledging of our faults, praying him to make us feel the^ more and more,
that we may be sorry for them, and ask him forgiveness with true
repentance, and fight against our lusts all the days of our life, till we
be thoroughly rid of them. And for as much as we be so wretched wyghtes,
that we can not be quite and clean discharged of them: let us beseech him
too bear with us till he have buried all our sins, too clothe us all over
again with his own righteousness. That it may please him to grant this
grace, not only to us, but also to all people. etc.

The. 10. Sermon which is the fourth upon the second Chapter.
11 And when Peter came too Antioch, I vvithstoode him to his face, because he
was to be blamed.

12 For before that certain came from James, he eat with the Gentiles: but
when they were come, he vvithdrevve and separated himself, fearing those
that were of the Circumcision.

13 And the other Jews also dissembled with him, in somuche that Barnabas
also was brought intoo their dissimulation.


We have seen heretofore whereaboutes the doctrine of Saint Paul strove:
that is to wit, about his abolishing of the Ceremonies of the law. Now, they
that strove against him had color fair enough, saying that the law was given
of God, and that it was not lawful to alter any part of it, seeing that God
was the Author of it. But they should have considered to what end the
Ceremonies were given to the people of old time. True it is that like as God
is unchangeable, so his word also indureth steadfast for ever: but yet does it
not follow thereupon, that God should not appoint men the things which he
knows to be meet for the^. Therefore the Ceremonies were ordained for a time,
too serve the necessity of the Jews. Also there was this respect which I have
touched: that before the coming of Jesus Christ, it was requisite that there
should be certain shadows too bring the faithful more further forward,
that is, that they might be confirmed in the hope of the redeemer that was
promised them. And thereupon we may well gather, that Gods inioyning of the
Ceremonies, was not too the end they should continue for ever, and stand
always in their full and perfect state: but to the intent they should continue
for a time, to serve to keep that people in the hope that was given them of
the things which we now have in our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the very body
and substance of the shadows that were in the time of the law. Ye see then to
what point we must come. And yet cannot a man argue, that God is variable as
some fantastical persons do, who have alleged the same reason. For shall we
say that God changes his purpose, because he makes Summer and VVinter? We
see the sundry seasons of the year, we see the earth wexe green, and the
trees bud flowers, and afterward bring forth fruit, and we see all things as
good as dead in the VVinter time: All this variety comes surely of God: but
yet does it not therefore follow, that he changes his nature. So likewise (as
I said before) he gave his law for man's behoof, and it was requisite that the
Jews (who had not yet such manifest knowledge as is given us by the Gospel)
should be helped by another mean, that is to wit, by the Ceremonies which no
wadayes should be needless, forasmuch as we have the performance of the things
that God showed them then a far off, and our state is in that respect better
than the state of the Jews. But now Saint Paul, to show that his preaching
of such liberty, and that the law which God had laid upon the necks of the
ancient fathers, was taken away at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, was
not without cause: declares that he rebuked Peter for the same matter. Now if
the Christians ought to have bin hilde in like bondage as the Jews had bin:
surely Peter would have mainteyned the quarrel to the uttermost. But he
suffered himself to be reproved, and confessed his fault. Seeing we have such
a president in the person of Peter: it follows that our case is good, and that
the Apostles knew that all the old shadows and figures ought to cease, and
be utterly abolished by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Thus the thing
that S. Paul sets down here, is that he rebuked Peter in the City of
Antioche for being conversant with the Gentiles, not with the unbelieving
sort, but with such as had bin converted to the knowledge of the Gospel. He
lived familiarly with them, accounting them as members of the Church. But
behold, as soon as certain Jews came from Jerusalem sent of James: Peter
fearing least some misreport might be rayzed of him, shrunk away, and made
countenance as though he had no familiarity nor acquaintance with the
Gentiles, and notwithstanding that they had the same faith of the Gospel which
he had, yet did he use them as strangers, because it was taken to be a kind
of defyling, to be in company with them. See here a wicked madness: for by
that means there was a division made in the Church. Ephesians 2. c. 14*
For (as it is said in another place) the wall was broken down when our Lord
Jesus Christ was appointed to be a light from God, not only for the Jews, but
also for the salvation of the whole world. Wherefore if it behooved those that
had erst bin separated and estraunged from the Church, to be called into one
flock: then does Peter disanull Gods grace, whereas yet notwithstanding we
know there is not a more precious thing than the union of the Church. Therefore
he that varieth from it, cannot by any means be excused. But behold, the
fault of Peter was, that he brake this bond of concord by separating the Jews
from the Gentiles, notwithstanding that all belonged too the body of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and were the very children of God. Again they had all one
selfsame head, and one selfsame redeemer: and therefore his deed was a
diminishing of Gods house, for so much as we be all gathered together in his
name, and do become his household folk, even till we be gathered up into the
heritage of heaven. But there was yet one other fault: which is that the grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ was darkened. For what fare we the better by his
coming, unless we know that in him we have the fullness and performance of
the things that were figured to us in old time* If we should offer sacrifize
nowadayes as they did in the time of the law: we should not know that we were
clenzed by the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that the same was a
sufficient payment for the satisfaction of all our sins, and that we have
there a perfect righteousness purchased for us. We should know none of these
things. Therefore S. Peter offended grossly in hanging up that veyle again,
which was as much as to stop Christ from being known as he ought to be.
Moreover, ^there was also a third fault, which was, that [therby] the Jews
were hardened in their error. True it is that we ought to bear with the
ignorant and weak ones, and not grieve the^ over much: and although they
ouershoot themselves, yet must they be brought back again by little and little,
rather than to break either bone or gristle of the^, as the proverb says: but
yet as for to nurrish their ignorance by soothing the^ in it, or by giving any
toke^ of alowance or welliking, that is naught. And Peter by withdrawing
himself from the Gentiles to please his own Countrymen, brought to pass that
the Jews might the better make their brags, that they had won their spurs,
for so much as Peter had given an incling that the Gentiles were unclean and
unholy people, and so his deed was an augmenting of the evil that was to great
already. In respect whereof S. Paul said, that Peter was blameworthy. And it
behooves us to mark this thing well and diligently, because some have thought
in times past, that it was done by agreement bytwixt them, and that S. Peter
was sorry that some of his Countrymen were to hard to be pleased, and therefore
had told S. Paul secretly, that he was contented to be rebuked of him. But all
this is but a flimflam. For S. Paul says expressly, that Peter was worthy of
blame, and that thereupon he had stepped up when he saw he walked not aright.
We see then that there was not a secret agreement or packing in this case:
but rather that S. Paul used the liberty that was given him [of God] and
rebuked Peter, and would not bear with him in that case, although he reverenced
him as the Apostle of Jesus Christ. And now upon this text we have to gather
for our own instruction, how precious this liberty is as I have declared
heretofore. For here the case stands not upon the only use of things: but
upon the having of our consciences quiet before God. If the debate had bin,
whither it were lawful to eat swines flesh or no, which was a thing
comprehended under the ceremonies of the law: it had bin a trifling matter, and
it might well have bin passed over, like as it may be nowadayes when the like
Ceremonies are talked of. But it behooved them too come to the well head, as I
have declared heretofore. For the figures served to hold the people of old
time as it were in wardship, like young children which are under governors, and
do not yet enjoy their liberty. But at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
like as faith grew great, so it was meet that such manner of teaching should no
more take place among the Jews. Then was not Saint Paul's stryuing, only
about the outward use of things, (for he would willingly have forborne
that:) but to the end it might be known to what purpose the Ceremonies of the
law had served: namely how it was not a bondage that should endure for ever,
but that they had stood in force, only to the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ. And hereupon it may be gathered, that when the Jews forbear the eating
of Swines flesh, or observed any holy day, or did this thing or that: they did
not a service to God that was of necessity in it self, but used it for the
continual exercising of themselves in the faith of Jesus Christ. Whereby we
see, that the Ceremonies had no virtue of themselves: but that when they were
referred too their due end and spiritual pattern, then it was perceived that
God had not ordained them, but to the benefit of the Church. Then let Jesus
Christ be separated from the Ceremonies, and they shall be but tryfles for little
children to play with. But if the end be considered whereunto they ought too
lead the faithful, then will it be found that they were profitable. Yea and
even we at this day may fare the better by them. Although the use of them be
abolished, yet may we by them gather the things that are showed us in the
Gospel. As how? Exodus 30. b 10.
It was said that the Priest should enter alone intoo the Sanctuary, and not
without sacrifice. Well then, therevppon we have to gather, Leu. 16. a. 2.
that there is neither man nor Angel worthy too come unto God, but that we
should be all of us shet out, if there were not a way opened for us in the
person of our lord Jesus Christ. Mark that for one point. Again we have also
to bear in mind, that we can have none atonement with God, nor boldness
and liberty to call upon him, except blood go with it: that is too say, except
the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ [go with vs] to get us grace and
favor. And all our prayers must be offered up by that mean, or else they
shall be refused at Gods hade. Moreover it is said, Exo. 24. c. 8*
that the book of the law was sprinkled with blood as well as the Sanctuary.
Heb. 9. c. 19*
We see then that all things should be unholy, if they were not hallowed by
the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ on all sides* and also that we should have
no assuredness of Gods promises, nor be able to apply them to our welfare,
unless they had seals continually at them. Besides this, when as it is said
that God is our father, and that our sins are forgiven us and we accepted of
him as righteous and giltlesse: none of these promises should be of any force,
neither could they boot us at all, except the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ
went before our eyes, so as all the word of God were (after a sort) written
unto us in red letters of the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. Thus ye see how
we should profit our selves by the Ceremonies of the law. But howsoever we
fare, the use of them is abolished, and if they continued still, we should
not have so good teaching by them as we have, for we should rest upon these
bace and corruptible things. But in as much as we have the heavenly pattern
that was spoken of unto Moses, Exodus 25. d. 40.
according also as the Apostle in the Epistle too the Hebrews, and Saint
Steven in the Acts do show right well: Heb. 8. b. 5.
now we understand wherefore God ordained such Ceremonies. Act. 7. f. 44*
The thing then which we have too mark for one point, is that we must
understand, how here is no speaking of matters of small importance, but in
knowing wherein the Ceremonies profited the fathers of old time, and why it was
Gods will to have them abolished at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. And
herewithal we see also, that Saint Paul spared not Peter though he were his
fellow, and were in as worthy and excellent an office as he was, and seemed
that of duty he should have bin borne withal. Howsoever the case stood with
him, he rebuked him sharply for that matter. We may much better deem, that if
it were a small and light thing, S. Paul would not have moved such debate and
strife for it. Needs therefore must it be a matter of great importance. But
by the way we be warned, that whenever Gods truth is defaced, or that any man
turns away from the pure simplicity of the Gospel, we must not in any wise
spare him, but although the whole world should set it self against us, yet
must we mainteyne the case with invincible constancy, without bending for any
creature. For if any man ought to be borne with, the same was Peter: and seeing
that our Lord Jesus Christ had bestowed such gifts of grace upon him, as to
give him that name, Saint Paul should have yielded somewhat unto him: yea, but
that matter was not to be borne with. Then ye see here an example, which
shows us that when the authority of men tends to the defacing of the
truth of the Gospel, we must fall too stryuing and not regard any creature.
And this is greatly for our profit nowadayes. For there are many that would
feign row between two streams, and although they perceive the abuses and
corruptions, yet would they bear on both sides, and all to purchase peace as
they themselves say, whereas in the end there must needs follow great
confuzion when men do so heave one at another. Therefore too appease all
discord, they would feign have a parting of stakes and a mingle-mangle made,
and that every man should bow on his side. But in the mean while, will God
give over his right at the pleasure of men? Or may we confederate our selves
too his prejudice? So then, seeing that we nowadayes have too encounter
against the wilful Papists, who have perverted, corrupted, and falsified all
the truth of the Gospel: although they face us with these honorable tytles of
holy Catholic Church, holy Sea Apostolic, Prelacie, Christendom, and holy
Supremacy (which yet notwithstanding are but vizors in very deed:) let us
not be abashed awhit at them. For why? we have God on our side: and besides
that the truth of the Gospel is so precious in his sight, as he will not have
any creature to be spared for it: according as we have seen how Saint Paul
himself tells us, that if it were possible for the Angels to turn us away
from the pure doctrine, we should hold them accursed, and refuze and abhor
them. And why then shall we seek too please mortal men, when they would
disguize the pureness of the Gospel, and mingle their own inventions with
it, and in so doing make our Lord Jesus Christ their underling, that they
might still keep possession of their errors? Is it meet that we should
yield up our places to them? A mischief light upon such concord: for it
shall always be cursed of God. Wherefore let us have such stoutnesse and
constancy of mind, that when we be once sure that the quarrel which we
mainteyne is Gods, we stagger not for any greatness or loftiness of the
world. Thus ye see in effect what we have to bear in mind. And here withal
we see also what the fondness of the Papists is, and how shameless that
vilane [the Pope] has bin in exempting himself from all correction. When the
Pope intends to magnify himself greatly, he calls himself the Successor
of Peter: and yet in the mean while, he will by no means submit himself too
any chastizements. He says that it belongs to him to correct all the world,
and that it is not lawful for any man to meddle with him. And whence comes
that exemption? For if he pretend to hold the place of Peter, we see here the
contrary. Peter was rebuked and bare it, yea and he willingly granted
himself to be guilty when he saw he was overcome. Seeing it is so, we must
needs conclude that there is no dignity in this world (how much so ever men
color it) which should not always be subject too Gods word. For what a
thing were it if it were otherwise, so as our Lord Jesus Christ should have
set up dumb Idols in his Church under the title and shadow of shepherds, and
that it should be lawful for them to find fault and rebuke, yea and too mar
and falsify all things, and in the mean while no man should open his lyppes
against them? Gods Church should become as it were a Swynes stye, infected
with all filthiness, and there should be no remedy to help it. Let us
mark well then, that God will not have any such preeminence to be in his
Church, as should hinder the continual course of his word, so as it should
not be able to bridle all such as are in any superiority above others. For it
behooves us to give ear to our Lord Jesus Christ, and he must have the
maystership that is given him of God his father, so as every man must yield
himself therevntoo, and none of us pretend to have any exemption. That is the
thing which is showed us in the person of Saint Peter. On the other part, we
see also after what sort the faults that are committed ought to be rebuked:
that is to say, openly before all men, and not only in secret: which thing is
well worthy too be marked. For there are many that can find in their hearts
too give cause of offense, who after they have set all in a broile, would have
a man do no more to them, but tell them softly in their ear that they have done
am^sse. For the common divinity is this. Math. 18. b. 15.
What I pray you? Is it not said that each should reprove other secretly?
Is it meet that a man should be so diffamed when he has done amiss? No
verily, if he have not offended in such wize, as his fault ingendereth
trouble in the whole Church. For even our Lord Jesus Christ does expressly
set down the same difference, so that if any man have done amiss and I know
it, I must rebuke him betwixt him and me. But if the fault be notorious and
open, and an occasion too bring in evil example, if he were not told of it:
then must I not any more keep that order of rowning him secretly in the ear,
but condemn the fault as it deserves, that others may take warning by it. And
this is meant, not only of private persons, but also of such as are in highest
degree: for it becomes them too lead the way, according also as in another
place too Timothy, 1. Tim. 5. d. 20.
Paul commands expressly, that such as have done amysse (though they be
the Sheepeheardes which have the charge too teach and govern the flock)
should be rebuked openly. The same thing has he put presently in practice
in the person of Peter. For in as much as the fault was ouergreate, and too
far out of square, and might engender greater trouble in the Church, because
it was (as ye would say) an overthrowing of the Gospel) for that there was
as yet some infirmity in many men: Saint Paul saw well it was requisyte
that Peter should be rebuked, and therevppon did it.

That therefore is the thing which we have to remember concerning that process.
On the otherside we see also the mildnes of Peter. It had bin said unto him by
the mouth of our Lord Jesus Christ, that besides his ordinary name of Simon,
Math. 16. c. 18.
he should be called Peter for the steadiness of his faith. He was excellent
among the rest of the Apostles: and yet nevertheless he stoupeth with his
head, and boweth down his neck when he sees that he has done amiss, and
makes no buckler of the honorable state wherein he was, but only
considers, that since Gods word is given us too correct us, it becomes us
to submit our selves too it, except we will be rebels against him, who in the
end will beat down all the pride of the world. Therefore S. Peter perceiving
that nothing is better for a man, than to receive chastizements when he has
done amiss: yields to that which was told him by S. Paul. Now if we
consider all these things well: we have here a very profitable story. For
on the one side we see how every man desires too hold in with the world:
and that is an occasion too blind us continually in our misdoings. For there
is nothing with us but flattering, and (to our seeming) we cannot be friends,
except every of us bear with his fellow. Surely there is a manner of bearing
with things, which is commendable, as I have said already: which is, to be
gentle in rebuking such as have done amiss, so as we labor to win them, and
draw them back again by freendlinesse, and be not too fumishe and hasty
with them. For there are faults that may be borne with, and which are not to be
searched to the bottom, for it does but sharpen men when they see an
ouereagernesse of fault fynding, according as ye shall see diverse which keep
as it were continual watch, too see if they can find any thing too carpe at
in some man or other: all their holiness consists in taunting of one man,
and in railing upon an other: and too be short, they be the greatest
Correcters of the world. But our desire [of rebuking] must be so brydeled, as
we seek not to find fault with men. And yet on the other side, the
flattering that reigns nowadayes to much in the world, is a vice which we
ought to shun as a deadly plague. Therefore according as every of us loves
his neighbor, so let him learn to use the freeness of speech which S. Paul
shows us here. And specially when Gods truth is in hand, let no man be
spared, let the zeal of God get the upper hand in us, and although we should
purchase displeasure, and run in danger of many slanders and backbytings,
yet ought we nevertheless to undertake the challenge. For there is no excuse
for us if we play the traitors, by dissembling when the truth of the Gospel
is falsified. Wherefore we must follow the thing that Saint Paul shows us
here: and the deed which he did too his fellow Peter, must serve us for a
law and rule, so as we may show that we desire nothing more, than that God
should be heard, that his truth should not be turned intoo a lie, and that
there should not be any thing shuffled too it, nor any Leven or Darnell mingled
with it, but that it should continue always in his own pure singleness. And
on the other side, the great ones are warned here, too submit themselves
meekely, and too yield themselves pliable too the correction that is offered
them, knowing that God surrendered not his own right when he advanced them
too that state, but must still keep his sovereign dominion, execute his
jurisdiction by his word, in such wise as they which are most highly
advanced, must bow down their necks, and understand that it were a
diuelishe confuzion too pretend a privilege too receive no chastizement. For
by that means Gods word should be as good as thrust out of doors, and he
be bereft of the soueraintie which he has over us: and therefore after that
manner must we put that doctrine in ure. And specially nowadayes when we see
men so bold too bend themselves after that fashion against God, let us be
fenced aforehande against them, and let nothing abash us, seeing we know what
the quarrel is wherein we fight against them: but let us hardily defy all that
filthy dungeon, that is to wit, the Pope and his Clergy, and let us not
pass a whit for these stinking vermin, when we see them bend their horns at
our Lord Jesus Christ, and that under his shadow and by pretending his name,
they go about too thrust his Gospel under foot, yea and too bury it utterly,
or else too make such a confuzed mingling of it, as men may not know who is
master. Then sith we see that the Devil possesses them after that sort,
let us not stick too arm our selves too the battle, and too stand out
against them too the uttermost: specially seeing that among other things, the
quarrel is more favorable too us in these days, than it could seem to be
in the time that Saint Paul mainteyned it. True it is that the reason is
alyke, and springs all out of one fountain: but yet was Saint Paul feign
too fight against the Ceremonies that God had commanded by his own mouth. And
why did he so? Because that thereby the Gospel was darkened, the grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ was after a sort beaten down, men's merits were
stablished, and finally men knew not whereat God had amed in his law. And
nowadayes the self same reasons move us, to fight against all the
abominations that have bin set up in the Popedom. But we have this for an
advantage, that all these things were forged in the shoppes of Satan and of
men. Now we know there is nothing but vanity in men, so long as they be
ruled by their own fancy, and submit not themselves too the obeying of God.
For as much as the case stands so, let us fight so much the more manfully,
seeing that our Lord does in all respects give us wherewith to keep us from
being dismayed at the titles that are set before us to outface us with, which
are naught else but illusions of Satan. Ye see in effect what we have to bear
in mind. But it behooves us also too mark well how Saint Paul adds that
his rebuking of Peter was because he and his companyons walked not the right
way in the truth of the Gospel: and besides that, his rebuking of them was,
because he saw that the mischief was already spread far and wide, and
that if he had forborne any longer, the remedy would have come out of season.
Behold here two reasons which it stands us on hand too mark well. As
touching the truth of the Gospel, I have showed you already how it is the
pureness which it behooves us to stick unto. He might well have said, that
they walk not the right way in the Gospel: but he speaks of the truth [of
the Gospel,] according as he had used the same word once before. The reason
why he does so, is for that men would have a half faced Gospel, and be are
themselves in hand, that they be discharged before God, so the name of
Christianity run roundly in their mouths. Like as at this day the word
Gospel is taken to be meetely honorable among the Papists: but yet the
Gospel which they have is but a bastardgospell, because they have put their
own collups and gobbets to it. They have turkined all things after their own
pleasure, and they have taken such a scope, that Jesus Christ is but an
underling in comparison of them. For they have given determinate sentence as it
were from Heaven. And in good sooth they have not been ashamed too say, that
the Contents of the Gospel are but as an Apsie of the Christians, or as it
were an introduction: and that the great Mysteryes and principal matters,
have been revealed too them since, so as they must come from Councels, and
from the Sea of Rome. Thus is our Lord Jesus Christ mocked, as though they
had taken in hand too crucify him new again. For men could not deuyze too
offer him a greater villanye, than too say that he was but as an Usher of a
School to teach folk their Apsie, and that the Pope is come in above him, to
bring in the state of perfection: and yet notwithstanding it is seen how the
Pope makes a minglemangle or hotchpotch (as men term it) of al things. Then
is the word Gospel villanously unhallowed among the Papists, and these
sticklers which would have men to agree unto many superstitions, and too
content themselves with a little of the Gospel, and in the mean while let
many abuses and errors continue still: do likewise darken the pure doctrine of
our Lord Jesus Christ. That is the cause why S. Paul speaks expressly of the
truth of the Gospel, to show that we must go to it roundly, and not by halues,
and that there must be no adding nor diminishing of the things which the son
of God has taught us, but that every man must be contented to hear him speak,
and too let him have his mouth open. Let us on our side open our ears and be
heedfull to receive whatsoever he says: and let no man presume to have an ore
in that boat, to say this would be good, or this or that should be done.
Wherefore let us so reverence the pure doctrine of the Gospel, as none of us
presume too change ought of it, but all of us yield to it without exception.
Thus much concerning the first reason that is set down here. So (to be short)
let us keep our selves true scholars unto our Lord Jesus Christ, and if any
man go about to make us swerve never so little from him, or to gad after the
doctrines and inventions of men: let us withstand them stoutly. And why? For
Saint Paul had none other respect, but that the Gospel might abide in his
pure and uncorrupted soundness. Wherefore let us follow him in the same
nowadayes, and we can never do amiss. Mark that for one point. Another is,
that we must also mark well, that if an inconvenience should increase, and
spread abroad by our silence and forbearing, we must provide for it
aforehande. For it were to late to shet the stable door when the Steed is
stolen. Therefore when we see that such as labor too entangle Gods truth, or
too mingle their own fancies with it do draw folk to them, and begin too
have some train and tail following them: then is it high time for us too be
fiery in fighting. For if we bear it: it is certain that we be guilty of
the decay of the Church, that shall come upon it, and whereas we think too
shift it off, God will not grant us that grace, for as much as we have bin
too cold and retchlesse. Therefore when the mischief increases, and that
there breeds any infection of it, (that is to say, when one begins too
mar another,) let us bethink us too set our selves lustely against it, and
not suffer the shrewd weeds too grow so far as to choke the corn, but let
us pluck them up bytimes. And this is too be done, not only in the errors
that mar the pure doctrine of the Gospel, but also in all vices and
corruptions [of manners]. Truly if there be any Heresies and wicked opinions
which might set all things in a broyle, it is all one as if a man should have a
stroke with a sword or a dagger in his breast or in his throat. For wherein is
the life and welfare of the Church, but in the pureness of Gods word? If a
man would come and put poison in our meat whereof we should take nurrishment,
should we hold our peace at it? No: but we should rather storm at it? Now
the self-same reason holds in the doctrine of the Gospel, and we must have
our hands always lift up too maynteyne the pure doctrine, and not suffer it
in any wise to be corrupted. Also when we see vices reygne, we must provide
for them and redress them in due season. For if we bear with it and do as
most men do, which do but laugh at it and provide for it at leyzure: we
shall afterward be at our wits end, too see how God has shet the gate, and
how Satan has won the goal out of all krie. And sure it is a just reward of
our rechlesnesse and coldness, when we be not heedefull to cure the diseases
as soon as we see them infect and mar the body of the Church after that
sort. Thus ye see what we have in effect too remember here: namely that we
must not be so foolish and lightminded, as too receive the things that these
Newters or dubblehanded men do put unto us, as who should say, that if the
great abuses be amended, it ought to suffyze us. But let us never leave till
the Gospel be set again in his pure soundness, and that we have it in the
self same wyze which our Lord Jesus Christ delivered it too us, without any
mingling put thereto by men. And secondly again, thereafter as we see the
mischief prevail, let us bring these back unto God which are gone astray,
and labor too stop those that lead their neighbors after that fashion too
destruction, and seek nothing but too turn all vpside down: let such men be
repressed, and let every one that has the zeal of God show himself their
deadly enemy, breaking asunder what soever may hold us back: and whither
there be friendship or kindred betwixt us* or any other of the streyghtest
bonds in the world: let us bury euerywhit of it in forgetfulness, when
we see the fowls that were bought with the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, so
led to ruin and destruction: or when we see things that were well settled,
overthrown, and nothing else sought but confusion, so as men might not know
any more what Jesus Christ is, and that by little and little the Devil gets
full scope, and carries us away headlong, as though the bridle were laid looce
in our neck. When we see the mischief tend too this point: let every of us
streyne himself too stop it, and show that we had lever too have deadly food
for the serving of God, than too have all the friendship in the world for
pleasing and pleasuring of mortal creatures. Wherefore let us not play the
blind men or blinkardes when we see God offended, but let us set so much
store by his truth and glory, that all other things may be nothing too us in
comparison thereof. Thus ye see in effect how we ought to put this doctrine in
ure. The residue shall be reserved till the afternoon.

Then let us now fall down before the Majesty of our good God with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us feel them more and
more, and that therewithal for as much as he will have us to come to him with
true repentance, it may please him to draw us by his holy spirit, and to bear
with our infirmities till he have quyte and clean purged and rid us of them,
and brought us to the perfection whereunto he calls and incourageth us. And
so let us all say, Almighty God our heavenly father. etc.

The. 11. Sermon, which is the fifth upon the second Chapter.
14 But when I savve that they vvalked not rightly after the truth of the
Gospel, I said too Peter before them all, if thou being a Jew live after
the manner of the Gentiles and not as the Jews, why compellest thou the
Gentiles to play the Jews?

15 We be Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles.

16 And yet for as much as we know that a man is not justified by the
works of the Law, but by belief in Jesus Christ, we also have believed
in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Jesus Christ,
and not by the works of the Law; for no flesh shall be justified by the
works of the Law.


IT has always bin a common saying, that look what Law a man lays upon
others, he ought too keep the same himself. For it is another right nor
reason, that a man should go scotfree himself, and lay the burden upon other
folks shoulders. And for that cause does our Lord Jesus Christ upbraid the
Scribes and Pharisees, Math. 23. a. 4.
that they passed not to lay heavy burdens upon the poor people, and in the
mean while took leave to do what they listed themselves. And commonly it
falls out through hypocrisy, that he which is rough and extreme in all
rigor toward his neybours, would have other men to forbear him and to
dispense with him. But if we will needs press our neighbors to do their
duty, the true and natural order requires, that every of us should first
begin at himself. Ye see then how it is a most manifest hypocrisy, when a man
will not a whit bear with his neighbors, but chale^geth their duty to the
uttermost, and in the mean while offends grossly himself, and will not suffer
any correction. Yea and sometimes also it falls out, that we would play the
good fellows at other men's cost. Even so fell it out here in S. Peter. For
his enforcing of the Gentyles to keep the Ceremonial law, came not of the
foresaid hypocrisy of taking leave too do what he listed, and of desiring
too go quite and clear before God for his constreyning of other men too such
a point: but of dubblenesse, for that he was too desirouse too pleasure his
own countrymen. He had already taken leave too live after the manner of the
Gentyles, that is to say, too give over the using of the Ceremonies of the
Law. For (as I have erst touched) S. Paul speaks not here of the
unbelievers, nor of the despyzers of God: but of those Gentyles that had bin
converted too the knowledge of the Gospel, and were desirous to serve God, yea
even without the old Ceremonies. Now S. Peter had fashioned himself to their
common trade, and yet notwithstanding he was a Jew: and therefore he did the
Gentyles too much wrong, to put a streyter bridle upon them, than he received
to himself, as I said before. He did it not in respect of himself, but playde
on both hands, as they do which would feyne keep favor with all parties,
and are loath too mislike any man. So we see there was rightful reason to
rebuke him, and too shame him before all the Church. Now remains that he
acknowledged his fault, by which example we must learn mildness. That is
to say, for as much as there is none of us all but he may step awry, as they
that have not such perfect wisdom but that we may fall even into gross
faults: and although we perceive it not, yet now and then we happen to swerve
through infirmity: at leastwyze let us not ieere at it when we be reformed, as
many proud and stubborn folk do, who either spew out their poison, or else
rancle inwardly in their hearts when they be rebuked. Let us learn first of
all by S. Peter's example, that there is none of us all so far foreward in
holiness, wisdom and virtue, which may not ouershoote himself. And therefore
let us patiently hear what is told us, that we may fare the better by it:
and let us not be ashamed too cast down our heads when we see our selves
justly accuzed and condemned. Thus ye see what we have to remember upon the
first part of this Text. Truly we have seen already this morning, how S.
Peter had this honorable title, to be called a chief pillar in Gods Church,
and in the spiritual Temple that was too be builded. He was honored, he and
his fellows had received the holy Ghost, and although he had stumbled once
before, yet had Jesus Christ set him up again, and wiped away the remembrance
of that fall, in saying to him, John. 22. c. 15.
feed my Sheep, have a care of my Lambs. And yet for all this, he walks
not the right way, but steppeth aside. Wherefore it behooves us too be so
much the warer that noman deceive us, as though we had profited so well in
Gods school, that we were no more in danger of doing amiss. Let us beware
of such ouerweening, and keep continual watch, that we be not misledde by
the wyles and traynes of Satan: yea let it be a suspicious matter with us too
desire too please men, seeing that S. Peter fell intoo that extremity. True it
is that his meening was too the contrary, and that his intent was too employ
himself wholly too the glorifying of Gods name. He had stoutly withstoode it
when he was forbidden too preach any more in the name of Jesus Christ. It was
the voice of an Angelical stoutnesse when he answered, Act. 4. d. 19 and 5. c.
29.
God must be obeyed and not men. For he saw there the rulers of his country,
he saw them assembled with their pomp, and there was the stateliness of
Magistrates, which had bin able too amaze a poor man of no credit as he and
his fellow John were. But not withstanding his stout answering that he would
obey God maugre all those that pretended too have pre-eminence over him, yet he
was deceived in this case whereof mention is made here. Therefore whenever
men do the thing that may thrust us out of the way, and we have some fair
cloak, so as it shall seem too us that we do not amiss too please them: Let
us bethink us of this example, that is set us down here, and which is told
us too make us every of us look about him what his calling will bear, and
what God commands, without casting of our eye aside too purchase favor in
the world. Let us shet our eyes against all that is about us, and look only
at this mark, that we must in all caces and all respects fashion our selves
too the will of God. And when we shall have looked rightfoorth too Gods
ordinances, and asked counsel at his mouth, and prayed him too guide and
govern us by his holy spirit, and finally well considered the bounds of our
vocation, so as we attempt not any thing otherwise than becomes us: then
shall we be able too eschew the ^lightes and allurementes of Satan and the
world, so as we shall not pass too pleasure creatures overmuch. But without
that, we shall be beguyled at every turn as it happened unto Peter. For if
we compare our selves with him: it is certain that he was much better able
too keep himself than we be. Nevertheless he was cast down afterward, too
the end that his doing might serve for our learning, and we be rid of all
pride, so as we might not thrust forth our own opinions to be ouerwyze in
our own brain and fancy, but that all our wisdom might be too rule our
selves according to Gods pure word. But now let us come to that which S. Paul
adds. He enters further intoo the matter and says, we be Jews by
nature and not sinners (that is too say, damnable men, defiled, and miserable
wretches) of the Gentyles. And yet notwithstanding for as much as we know that
we cannot be justified by the deeds of the law, and that there is none other
means to make us acceptable to God, than by coming too him with the grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ: we have renounced the righteousness of the law; and
assured our selves, that Gods accepting of us must be of his own free
goodness for his sons sake. Seeing then that we Jews have renounced our
own worthiness, what shall the Gentyles now do? must not all be reconciled to
God, through his own mere goodness without bringing any thing of their own,
and without pretending to have any manner of desert or worthiness of
themselves? Here (as I have touched before) S. Paul enters into the
principal point of his disputation; against such as mingled the Ceremonies of
the law with the Gospel. Howbeit S. Peter was none of that number. For it is
certain that he knew well enough, that there was none other mean too come
unto God, than by his mercy as it is showed us in our Lord Jesus Christ.
Saint Paul had communed sufficiently with him before of that matter, as we
have seen. He agreed fully with S. Paul as touching doctrine. Then was not
Saint Peter wrapped in that error: for it had bin a superstition that had
utterly defaced the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore S.
Peter would have abhorred that. But the dissimulation that I treated of this
morning, was an occasion to harden the Jews in the fond dotage which they had
conceived of their own meritorious works. Not that he intended it: another is
it a sufficient excuse for us though we protest a hundred times, that we
meene not too maintain evil: but if we make any countenance at all of it,
surely we are always worthy too be condemned both before God and the
world. Saint Peter then agreed very well with Saint Paul as concerning
doctrine, namely that there is none other mean too come before God too obtain
grace, than by renouncing all creatures, and by confessing that there is
nothing but cursednesse in us, and that God must receive us of his own mere
mercy for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake. S. Peter knew this, and taught it
without any gain saying. And moreover he wist well it was lawful for him to
give over the use of Ceremonies. For he would not have granted too any such
liberty, unless he had known that the same had bin purchaced for us by the
death and passion of the Son of God. Nevertheless he swarued a little too
much, too the intent too keep still his own Countriemen, because he knew that
the Jews were somewhat too wilful and wayward, and therefore he meant no more
but to bear with their nature. But S. Paul respects not the person of his
fellow S. Peter, another reasons he with him, as if he should say, thou art
an abuzer of men, thou know not what the Gospel meeneth, but he says
unto him, bethink thee well what is like too befall of thy doing, and what
inconvenience it will draw with it. For whereat ame they that would have men
too keep the Ceremonies of the Law? even too get some holiness by them, or
to bind men so too them, as they should use them upon necessity of salvation,
and to deserve favor by them at Gods hand, and finally to obtain forgiveness
of sins by keeping of circumcision and all other such things. But in so doing
they be hild down in this error, that they renounce the death and passion of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and yet notwithstanding thou intendest too feed them in
that fondness, and what a thing were that?

Therefore let us mark well how S. Paul passes not what Peter's opinion is in
this behalf, but deals with the matter it self, to the end that all cloking
might be taken away from such as did shet the Gospel out of doors, besides that
they did also rende the Church asunder as we saw this morning. Howbeit for
as much as it is a matter that cannot be [fully] discoursed in a day [or
twain,] no nor in four: we must take the things in order as they lie, to the
end we may know why S. Paul strove so sharply for the abolishing of
Ceremonies. For the case concerns the salvation of our Souls, and it is the
chief point that we must learn in gods schole, next after the glorifying of
him, For if we fall too comparisons, it is certain that the serving of God
does always go in order and degree before the salvation of our souls. True
it is that they be things inseparable: for God shows his infinite love which
he bears us, in this that never any thing serves too his glory, but that
the same is immediately fit and profitable for our salvation. Howbeit for
as much as God has loved us so greatly, and continues still his favor
toward us: we on our side are bound unto him, both too forget our selves
and to give selves wholly unto him. But how soever we fare, we see here the
two grounds of all our Religion: namely too know how God ought too be honored
and served, and also how we may so offer our selves before him, as he may
accept us and auow us for his children, and we hold him for our father, and
by that means be fully assured of our salvation. And these two points are
contained in the discourse that S. Paul handles here. For the case is, after
what manner God will be served: according as the cheef sacrifize that he
demands, is the confession of humility: I say humility: not by making
demure countenances, but by being touched with such remorse, as we suffer our
selves too be utterly condemned before God, and all the trust of our own
works and merits be thrust under foot. Mark that for one point. And more
over, when God commanded the Ceremonies, it was not for that he passed upon
these outward things: but for that he amed at another end: which was, that [on
the one side] the Jews should be inured to patience, by continual perceiving
of their own wantes and miseries, and therevpo^ rid themselves from al
corruptions of the flesh: and on the other side be led to our Lord Jesus
Christ, to repose their trust in him, and to rest wholly there. So then, as
touching those that would have the ceremonies of the Law kept, as if it were of
necessity that me^ should be precisely bound to the^ upon pain of [deadly]
sin as they term it: it is certain that their meening was to set up a
seruis of God contrary too his will and meening, and that they were as good as
Cousiners: for why, they perverted the natural meening of the Law. Mark that
for one school point. Another is, that they taught men to set up their
bristles, and to glory in themselves, and that was an abolishing of Gods glory:
for we cannot chale^dge aught (be it never so little) to ourselves, but we rob
and rende away that which belongs unto him. Ye see then how it is a devilish
trayterousnesse when men presume upon their own power, as though they had any
spark of righteousness in themselves. And besides that, it is an entering
into the gulf of hell, when we ween to get salvation by our own works. For
we renounce the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, where we should
seek all our righteousness. Again the Devil makes us to believe wonders*
howbeit, it is but to make us to fall into destruction. Wherefore let us mark
well, that S. Paul treats here of the manner of justification before God,
that is to say, of the mean whereby we be brought into his favor, because it
is the principal point which we ought to learn, and without that, all the
religion [or deuotion] that can be named, is but smoke and leazings. And it is
not for naught that Saint Paul enters into that question. For many men
make this allegation* How now? The case concerned the Ceremonies of the law:
and why then does Saint Paul (as ye would say) fling himself overthwart the
feelds? Why speaks he of righteousness, of man's salvation, of the
forgiveness of sins, and finally of all the whole law? Now on the one
part, it behooved him too deal with all those things* as for example, when we
in these days teach, that men must not keep the superstitions of the
Papists, nor any of the things that have bin so devised by the wit of man:
we shall not only debate whither flesh may be eaten upon frydayes, or
whyther such a wake, vigil, or Saints even be too be kept, or whyther this
thing or that thing be to be done: but we shall treat generally whither it be
lawful for a mortal man to make laws to bring men's consciences into
tyrannical bondage. Esa. 33. d. 22
For God has reserved to himself alone the authority and prerogative to be
called the lawmaker, to the intent that no man should vsurp any such
pre-eminence in the Church. Then seeing that the spiritual government of our
souls ought to be taken out of Gods pure word: we may conclude, that another
Pope, nor any other man of what calling soever he be, has power to burden us
with any laws, or ought to attempt any thing that is against the doctrine
which we have of God. Then may we well enter into that general discourse: and
that is because the reason of them is alike in all points. If we should dispute
only about the eating of fish or flesh, it would be but a fond disputation.
For every man must eat according as is for his health, or as he can get: and
therefore such disputation should not concern the health of men's souls, or
the matter that were requisite for them to rest their conscience upon. But when
we take in hand too show that it is not for any living creature to advance
himself so high, as to lay laws upon men's necks: the other disputation is
fully resolved and dispatched. Again when as men say, that in babbling
paternosters to buy out their sins, and in gadding on pilgrimage to get there
the things which in popery are termed the works of supererogation (that is
to say, works of overplus that men do more than God commands them) they
ransom themselves and make him some recompense for the faults that they have
committed: If we speak simply of pilgrimages, and go not to the ground and
welspring of the matter: it will be a cold and sle^der discourse. But if we
declare how all our satisfaction is in the things that are purchaced for us by
the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, and therewithal that God
utterly misliketh all that is of our own invention, and that he will be served
with obedience: then do we lay forth the case as it ought to be, and may
bring it to a sure and certain conclusion. After that manner did S. Paul. For
he regarded not only what the Jews said, how it behooved them to forbear the
eating of swines flesh, and to keep such a feast or such a feast, and all the
residue of the Ceremonies: but he marked to what end they said it: namely how
they went about too show, that the keeping of the law was of necessity of
salvation and that was a yoke of bondage upon men's consciences, that could not
be borne. Again he saw how the liberty that was purchaced us by our Lord
Jesus Christ was taken away, and that was another point that compelled him to
enter into that discourse. But the chief point that he treats of here, is
that such as would have had men to keep the Ceremonies, had a secret meening
that the same was an acceptable seruis unto God, and of such importance as me^
should purchase righteousness and soulehealth by it, and (to be short) that it
was a meritorious thing. But S. Paul shows, that it is impossible for me^ to
purchase righteousness before God by their works. Now therefore we see for
what cause S. Paul treated generally of our justification, when as
notwithstanding his adversaries pretended no more, but the keeping of the
Ceremonial law, and the continuing thereof still as before the coming of our
Lord Jesus Christ, so as men should still offer sacrifise, and do the rest of
the shadows and ancient figures. And hereby we see also what a folly it is
for the Papists to think themselves escaped, in saying that S. Paul speaks
here but of the works of the law, and not of the moral works. True it is that
they be not the first founders of that dotage. For the Devil has always had
his ministers to cousin the people. But we must not rest upon the authority of
men, specially of such as have another religion nor fear of God in them.
Although that many of the Monks have bin reported to be men of great skill:
yet notwithstanding they have bin but fantastical fellows, and never had any
taste of the fear of God. Even those that were called the ancient doctors,
have perverted the kindly sense of the holy scripture, and were as utterly
bewitched by Satan, and yet the wretched world has bin so blind, that it
could not perceive it. These kind of men have expounded this saying, that we
be not justified by the deeds of the law, to import that we be not
justified by the deeds of the law, to import that we be not justified by
circumcision, or by absteyning from any certain kynds of meats, or by keeping
such a holyday or such a feast, whereas notwithstanding S. Paul treats of
none of all those things. He matcheth Gods grace against all our works, and
finally shows that we cannot bring aught unto God, but that we must be feign
to be admitted freely of him. That is S. Paul's drift. And if we should not set
the same mark before our eyes, surely all the doctrine that is contained in
this Epistle, would be but fond matter. Furthermore let us mark, Romans 3. d. 27
that S. Paul does oftentimes say simply and without addition, that we be
justified without works: like as in the third Chapter too the Romans, he
says we have a clear and sure proof of our righteousness, namely that we
be rightuous before God through the remission of our sins, and not by our
works. He says not there, by the works of the law* but he sets it
down single [without addition,] to the end that all mouths should be
stopped, and all startingholes be taken away* Yet is it not without cause that
he speaks of the works of the law, to bring to nothing all the services that
men can allege too bind God withal, as though they were able to become
righteouse of themselves. For as we shall see hereafter, although we were as
perfect as Angels, yet could not that bind God at all, if it were not for that
he of his own good will has made this promis in his law, Leui. 18. a. 5
he that does these things shall live in them. Then if we go about to get
favor at Gods hand for our own works sakes, we must not dispute
philosopherlike, that God owes us any wages or recompense for the seruis that
we have done him: for we be his, and we cannot bind him by aught that we can
do. How then may our works be recompensed as though they were auaylable before
God? Even because he has promised so to do. It is the covenant which he has
made with us in saying, he that does these things shall live in them. So then,
if we could perform the law to the full, surely we should be righteous before
God, and deserve salvation* howbeit not for any worthiness that should be in
our selves, but by reason of the covenant that God has made with us. For we
see that all the desert which can be alleged on man's behalf, depends
wholly upon the said promis. And that is the cause why saint Paul says
always, the works of the law, the works of the law. For there are none other
works that deserve to be accepted of God and to have any recompense. Therefore
let that serve for one point. And we shall see hereafter, how we be utterly
excluded from that righteousness* because we come short of it: and that Gods
telling of us that we shall be saved by keeping of the law, is all one as if
he had said, that we be all of us damned. And why? For there is not any manne
that discharges himself of it, but all of us are transgressers. Ye see then
that the law can bring us nothing but death, by reason of our infirmity. But
this shall be laid forth more at length in his order* It is enough for this
time that we know how Saint Paul's setting down of this doctrine, is against
the Jews which boasted themselves and were puffed up with pride, as though God
had bin bound unto them for their observing of the Ceremonies of the law. No
no, (says he) it is nothing worth: and we shall see the reason of it
afterward. Furthermore S. Paul's debating of the case of Ceremonies, is
because these hypocrites which took upon them to match themselves with God,
and too have the praise of their salvation themselves, did always buzie their
heads about small trifles, and came not to the chief point, which is to enter
into their own consciences. Like as at this day in the Popedom, they that do
so much preach their own merits, and say that we must purchase Paradise by
our own works, and that although we be sinners, yet we have a way to discharge
ourselves to Godward by satisfactions: what allege they? When those great
Rabines go about to set men after that manner upon the stage to be honored as
Idols, and when they have made their great prefaces of free will, of their
own virtues, of their satisfactions, and of their merits or deseruings: what
bring they? Exhort they men to live chastely, without doing other men wrong, or
without any covetous desire, so as every of us should content himself with
that he has, be patient in adversity, bear wrongs and reproaches, and in all
things show ourselves to be the Disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ by
forsaking ourselves? There is not one word with them of these things. But the
good works which they set before us are, that we must go deuoutely too Mass,
take holywater before we enter into the Church, be cross ourselves, kneel
down before a stock, worship a puppet, gad on pilgrimages, keep such a
feastfull day, found a Trentall, deal doales for the dead, and do this and
that. So then, all these hipocrites which will needs become righteous by their
own works, have nothing but gewgawes and dotages: and yet for all that, they
think themselves so holy and perfect, that nothing is amiss in them. They
think that God ought to content himself with the great number of murlimewes
and countenances which they make. But that is not the coin wherewith he must
be paid: for his law is spiritual. He looks not upon the outward gesture,
nor upon the things that carry a fair gloss before men, in so much that if
men set their minds too much upon his own Ceremonies, he rejects it utterly:
And that is a thing well worthy the marking. For men seek still some
startinghole, that they might not yield themselves to the obeying of God: and
they bear themselves in hand, that when they have once dispatched their fond
devotions, then they be well discharged, and all the rest of their sins must
be forgotten, because they ransom them by that means. The thing therefore
which we have to mark here, is that Saint Paul strove here against such
men, as never wist what it was too serve God in good earnest, nor never entered
into their own consciences. And even such are these Shauelings in the
Popedom, and those naughtipacks that have their full scope there: I meene not
only the Cardinals and these horned beasts the Bishops, (for men know that
they be the filthiness which infecteth the whole world) but I speak also of
those that are called doctors, the vpholders of their Catholic faith. It is
certain that they be but mockers of God, they never entered into their
consciences to examine themselves earnestly, another had they ever any remorse of
conscience. Surely all their study has bin to hold folk as it were upon the
rack, and to put many hartgripes into them, to the intent they might seem to
be sharpwitted. But as for themselves, they never felt any thing. And that is
the cause why they prate so much at their case concerning merits, and yet in
the mean while have no regard of them themselves. Only they do some small
trifles, like rittlerattles that men give to little children, wherewith they
bear themselves in hand that they can appease God. Now for this cause Saint
Paul disputes of the Ceremonies of the law, as they were put unto him: and
yet does he nevertheless cut home to the bottom, that is too wit, [hee
prooueth] that men are stripped stark naked from all righteousness, and
cannot bring any thing unto GOD, but must beg at his hand, confessing that
there is nothing in them but utter beggerie and penury. And furthermore let us
mark also, that the Jews did always pervert the nature and use of the
Sacraments, in that they made meritorious works of them, and that was clean
contrary to the use that they should have put them too. For God ordained not
the Sacraments to the end that by indeuoring to observe them, men should
purchase any virtue that might be imputed to them for righteousness: but
rather to teach them that it stood them in hand to seek all at Gods hand. As
for example, when the Jews were circumcised, thereby God showed to the eye,
that all that ever comes of man is but corruption, and that it stands us on
hand to have it cut away. So, the thing which the Jews had too consider in
that visible Sacrament, was that man's nature was cursed before God, and that we
may well seek but never find so much as one drop of cleanness in it. And on
the other side they had a token and record, that God nevertheless would
succor them by means of the Redeemer, which should come of the race of men:
for he was borne of the lineage of David. God therefore showed that thing
visibly. And so the Jews were cast down in themselves, and ought to have
considered that there was nothing but cursednesse in them, and thereupon should
have come to seek the thing in our Lord Jesus Christ which wanted in
themselves. As much is to be thought of their washings. As often as the Jews
washed themselves, it was a putting of them in mind, that there was nothing
but uncleanness in them. And wherein was that washing? was it in the water? No:
but in the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. When the brute beasts were
slain, there they behild that they had deserved death. The beasts were
giltlesse, and yet they were sacrifised for men's sakes, to bear their
sins. Thus ye see a mirror which shows that all men are cursed of God. And
yet in so doing men humbled themselves, calling upon God, and protesting that
they were redeemed by the sacrifise: Howbeit not by those shadowing sacrifises,
but by the true sacrifise which was not yet come into the world. But what did
the Jews? When they were once circumcised, they thought that God was bound
unto them for it. And when they had offered sacrifise, they thought there was
great holiness in so doing, and made their boast thereof. But the Prophets
rebuked those hipocrites dubble. For first they told them that when they had
kept all the Ceremonies of the law, their doings were nothing, Osee. 6. b. 6.
all was but vanity. For behold, God says, I will have mercy and not
sacrifice: and again, I will show thee o man how thou shall please God: be thou
humbled truly, and imagine not to bring him many sheep and Oxen, Micheas. 6. b.
8.
for that is nothing: but deal thou justly and uprightly, and when thou have
worshipped him, live honestly and incorruptly with thy neighbors. Also we see
what our Lord says in Jeremy. Ier. 7. e. 22.
Did I speak to your fathers (says he) of offering sacrifice unto me? No,
(says he) but I willed them to obey me, and to harken to my voice, and to
serve me with a sound heart. Again in another place it is said, Ier. 1. e. 23.
Lord thou love faithfulness. Thus we see how the prophets rebuke the
Hypocrites for being hild back by the Ceremonies, which are nothing of
themselves, except men walk in a clear conscience toward God, and in
faithfulness toward men. And after that the Prophets have spoken so: they
add secondly that when men have done all that they can, yet cease they not to
be still in Gods debt, Ier. 31. f. 34
and that the Ceremonies serve to bring them still nearer, that is to wit, to
make them acknowledge that God calls them to him, promising them to show them
mercy, and too forget and bury all their misdeedes, howbeit by mean of the
Redeemer that was promised them. But now Saint Paul leaves the first point,
namely that the Ceremonies are nothing without the principal, which is that we
walk without doing any man wrong, and without doing any hurt or harm to other
men, that we live chaste and pure, and that we have a clean and upright
conscience. S. Paul lets that discourse alone: and why? For it would not
serve the purpose. And therefore he shows that the shadows of the law were
another profitable nor needful, because they were nothing if a man looked upon
them in their own nature, but that the end of them was to be considered, which
was that for as much as they were a witness of the grace that is given us now
finally in our Lord Jesus Christ: it behooved them to rest wholly thereupon. And
the same ought to be well printed at this day both in our heart and in our
remembrance. For we shall have profyted greatly, if we once know how to apply
to our use the Sacraments that are ordained by our Lord Jesus Christ,
specially for as much as we have to receive the Lords supper the next Sunday.
For although we ought to have bin exhorted this day to put ourselves in a
reddines to it, yet was it not touched this morning. But let us bear well in
mind, that if we think to be made ryghteous by baptim, we defyle the thing
which God has appointed to our salvation. And why? Baptism does but teach us
that there is nothing but filthe and uncleanness in us. For wherefore do we
wash our hands, faces, and bodies, but to make them clean from the spots
that are in them? Now it is said that Baptism is a washing of us: and
therefore it follows that when we come to Baptism, or when any of us
brings his children [to be baptized] we declare that the children are
already damned and forlorn eue^ from their mothers womb, and that they be a
cursed seed, so as they must be feign to break clennesse, not by their own
purchase, but by receiving it, for as much as it is offered them in our Lord
Jesus Christ. Now if children be already full of infections at their coming
into the world: Job. 15. b. 16
what are we who never cease to offend our God, and do drink wickedness as a
fish drinks water, as it is said in the book of Job? Again, when we come
too the Lords supper, what come we to do? Come we to get any thing of God by
our own desert? No: but to confess that we be like wretched dead men, which
come to seek our life out of our selves, and therefore must be feign to have
the flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ for our meat, and his blood for our
drink, and all things in him which we want in our selves. Ye see then that
the Sacraments serve not to puff us up with any presumption, but to make us
walk in humbleness, to the end that being void of all selfe-trust, our
whole seeking may be to be succored by Gods infinite goodness, and by his
pouring out of the treasures of his grace upon us according to our need. And
our coming to them is, that God should warn us of our sins, to be touched
with them in good earnest. And we must not acknowledge our selves sinners
with the mouth only, or slightly and by way of ceremonies: but we must have
our hearts wounded inwardly with grief that we have offended, and feel how
dreadful Gods wrath is, too the end we may be sorry in our selves, and not
have any rest till he have showed us where we shall find it, that is too wit
in our Lord Jesus Christ. And when we come to this holy table, let ever, of us
look well that he be so grounded in our Lord Jesus Christ, as that he having
forsaken all the fond illusions of Satan, and all the deceiptes that he
sets before us too turn us away from the grace of God, and may embrace our
Lord Jesus Christ with the merits of his death and passion, assuring our
selves that it is he in whom we have the full performance of righteousness and
salvation. Moreover forasmuch as our Lord Jesus Christ has called us to be
members of his body, let us knit our selves together, indeuouring to glorify
God as it were with one heart and one mouth, and therwithall to live in true
unity with our neighbors, like as the hand serves both the foot and the
eye. So then let us have the said brotherlynesse in such estimation, as we
may show that we intend not to separate our selves asunder, as it were too
^eare Jesus Christ in pieces: but that our desire is that he should so knitte
us together, that not only he may live in us, and we in him: but also that he
may so rule us by his holy spirit, as every of us may indeuer to serve and
honor him first of all, and afterward to employ him self in the serving of
his neighbors, according to the ability which he shall have.

And now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him too make us feel them more and
more, that the same may always stir us up to better repentance, and cause us
to continue therein to the end, and also make us to grow in faith to our Lord
Jesus Christ, so as we may give our selves wholly unto him, and in his name call
upon God his father, to the end that he may here us, and continue his
gracious goodness toward us, till he have drawn us wholly too him self, to
make us feel perfectly the benefit which is purchased for us by his death and
passion. That it may please him to grant this grace not only to us, but also
to all people. etc.

The twelfth Sermon which is the sixth upon the second Chapter.
15 We be Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles.

16 And yet for as much as we know that a man is not justified by the works
of the law, but by belief in Jesus Christ, we also have believed in Jesus
Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Jesus Christ, and not by
the works of the law: for no flesh shall be justified by the works of the
law.


WE have seen alredie and declared heretofore, why S. Paul having to treat
of the Ceremonies and shadows that were before the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ, concluded generally that men could not attain righteousness before
God to stand in his favor, but by keeping the whole law. Now a man might
deem at the first sight, that these were diverse matters. Howbeit (as I have
said before) it behooved Paul to come to the pure use [of ceremonies] to show
that men do but beguyle them selves, when they think to obtain favor at Gods
hand by their own merits. Secondly, also I declared why S. Paul does expressly
add the word Law. For although it have always bin a common opinion in the
world, that by living well men might bind God to be good unto them, yet did
they fowlly deceive them selves therein. For do what we can, God shall not be
any whit at all beholden unto us, because we owe unto him what soever we be
able to do. Then is there not any deserte (if there might be any deserving at
all) but by the covenant which God has made, Leu. 18. a. 5.
in saying, that he which fulfilleth the law shall obtain life and salvation.
For as much as God has spoken that word, no doubt but he accepts the
obedience that is yielded unto him, as if it deserved salvation: but yet is not
that as much too say as that we can deserve ought. For there is none of us
all that discharges his duty, as we shall see hereafter. That promise
would be too no purpose, or at least wise it would be vnauaylable, so as it
should never take effect, unless God gave us another remedy, that is too
wit, unless he forgave our offenses, and accepted us for righteous,
although we be not so. But how so ever the case stand, when S. Paul says
that we be not justified by the works of the Law, his meaning is, that if
we intend too claim favor and salvation, because God has promised that
such as keep his law shall be righteous, and so taken to be: that will not
serve our turn, because none of us fulfilleth the Law, but we are all of us
gyltie before God, and must receive sentence of damnation upon our heads. And
for the better expressing hereof he makes a comparison between the Jews and
the Gentiles. Although (says he) that we be Jews by nature, and not Heathen
men: yet do we know that we shall not otherwise obtain Gods favor, than by
believing in our Lord Jesus Christ. Now it may peradventure seem, that
although men being corrupted in Adam can not deserve ought: yet
notwithstanding the Jews had a special privilege, because God had adopted
them as it were for his own children, and accounted them to be as his
household. And that was the thing wherein the Jews deceived them selves. For
when the Scripture speaks of uncircumcision, it means the uncleanness
wherewith we be compassed about in Adam, in so much as there is not any man
which is not damned already from his mothers womb. But the Jews thought that
God had set them free from that common curse, and they made their boast thereof.
Surely Gods chosing of them after that sort for his own people and heritage,
was a great dignity, and worthy too be esteemed above all worldly goods. But
yet nevertheless it became them to have acknowledged with all humbleness,
that there was not any excellency at all in their own persons. For according
to our wonted manner of drawing Gods gracious gifts too much to vain
ouerweening, the Jews did commonly ouershoote them selves, by bearing them
selves in hand that they were above all the rest of the world: Verily as who
should say, that God had found any thing in them, why he should prefer them
before those whom he had forsaken. Therefore that doing of theirs was a great
pride, which carried with it a shameful thanklesnesse, in that they imputed
not to Gods mere goodness, the things which they had of his free gift, but
were puffed up with ouerweening, as though God had known them to be better or
worthyer of everlasting salvation, than the Gentiles. But now S. Paul to
dispatche all ouerweening, says: Go too, we be Jews by nature. As if he had
said, It is true that we have some favor above the Gentiles; whom God has
not vouchsafed to receive into his Church. When he speaks after that
fashion, it is not to give the Jews occasion to wax proud: but to lay before
them the things which they had received freely of God, wherein they had no cause
at all to brag of them selves, according as we see how that in the Epistle to
the Romans, he utters two sayings, which at the first ^lushe might seem
contrary. For on the one side, Have we then (says he) no privilege above
the Gentiles? Yes verily, for God has chosen us for his people, he has given
us the seal of Circumcision too show that he auoweth us for his children,
he has alyed him self unto us, he has promised us the Redeemer of the
world, and (too be short) he has sanctified us in such wise, that if we
consider the favor which he has uttered toward us, there has been well
wherewith to advance and exalte us above the residue of the whole world. Thus
on the one side Paul does there magnify the goodness of God: and afterward
he falls too questioning again, and asks, what advantage have we then?
None at all (says he) for all men are shut up under Gods curse. If the
Gentiles be too be condemned, we be too be condemned double: for there may
be yet some likelyhoode that ignorance shall serve to excuse them. But yet can
they make no defense of that before God, but shall perish although they never
had any instruction or teaching. Needs then must we be condemned by the law
(says he) seeing that God has taught us, and yet for all that we cease not
too sin still, and too transgress his commandments, in so much that we be
plunged in greater and deeper cursednesse, than the Heathen folk and
unbelievers. Now then he says that the Jews are in deed separated after a
sort from the Gentiles, not that the Jews are of more worthiness, or that
they have any righteousness in them selves* but because God of his own mere
goodness voutsafed to chose them* like as at this day the children that are
borne of believing parents, are not better than the children that are borne of
Paynims and Turks, if a man consider them both in their own nature. For we be
all of a corrupted and cursed lump and God has so condemned us, as no man
can justly set up his bristles, to think him self of more value than his
fellows. 1. Cor. 7. c. 14.
But yet nevertheless, S. Paul shows that they be sanctified, and that they
be not unclean, as those are which are borne of unbelievers or Heathen folk.
Here should seem to be some contrariety: nevertheless, all agrees very
well together. For there is nothing but uncleanness and filthiness in us all
without exception, and that comes of nature. Howbeit, there is a
supernatural gift, that is to say, a remedy that God gives: which is, that
the children of the faithful are dedicated unto him, and he acknowledges and
auoweth them for his. Then like as now a days the children that are borne of
the Church, are reckned too be of the number of Gods people, and of the
company of the chosen: even so under the law, the Jews were separated from
the rest of the world. And that is the cause why S. Paul says, We be I^wes,
and not sinners of the Gentiles. Whereas he speaks of Sinners, he means
such as continue in their filthynesse, and are not cleansed by the grace of
God. For Circumcision was a token and witness that God accepted Abraham's issue
and offspring for his own household and peculiar people. The thing then wherein
the Jews differed in old time from the unbelievers, was that although they
were all of one suit, for as much as they were all indifferently the children
of Adam: yet notwythstandyng God had chosen the one sort, and left the other
sort still strangers from his house. If a man ask why he did so: there was
none other cause than his own mere grace, and yet were not the Jews in the
mean while the more excellent. But now let us follow the matter that S.
Paul handles here, We know (says he) that we can not be justified by
the deeds of the Law, but by belief in Jesus Christ. In so saying he
shows, that the Jews them selves (what grace soever they had received)
could not ground them selves upon other men, nor upon them selves, as though
they had deserved aught at Gods hand, but must be feign to flee to his free
goodness, acknowledging that there is no salvation but in Jesus Christ, who
is come to find out the thing that was already lost. And herein is fulfilled
that which he says in another place, how that as well they which were nere
hand, Ephesians. 2. d. 17
as they that were far off, were all gathered together into one Jesus Christ
is the peacemaker to cause God to love us, and to receive us too mercy: not
only those that were erst far of, as the Gentiles: but also the children of
Abraham, what nobleness or dignity soever were in them, for that came not of
their own nature. And let us mark, that when S. Paul says, that the Jews
which were converted to the Christen faith, knew they could not be
justified by the works of the law, but by belief in Jesus Christ: he makes a
comparison between faith and the Law, to show that we can not be justified
by grace, except we forsake all our own merits: and that is a thing well
worthy too be marked. For the Papists will well inoughe confess that we be
justified by faith, howebeit they add that it is but partly. But that gloss
marreth all. For here it is proved that we can not be found righteous
before God, but by the means of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by resting upon
the salvation which he has purchased for us. The Papists see this well
enough: and therefore for fashion sake, they say we be justified by faith, but
not by faith only: they will none of that. That is the thing that they fight
against: and it is the chief point that is in controversy betwixt them and
us. But S. Paul bewrays here their beastlynesse, when he says, but by
belief. For that word betokens that all that ever men presume to bring unto
God to win his favor with, is quite cut off. Ye see then that the door is
shut against all deserving, when S. Paul avouches, that there is none other
mean than by faith. We shall see more plainly hereafter why faith is so
compared with the law, as a thing full but against it. For the law presupposes
that if we have once fulfilled Gods commandments, we shall be taken for good
servants, and that he will pay us the wages which he has promised: and faith
presupposes us to be wretched, damned, and forlorn folk, and that we must be
feign to seek the things that we want in Jesus Christ. As for example. There
are two men that desire to be boorded and lodged: whereof the one brings
money with him, and looks to be well interteined for his well paying: and both
of them require meat and drink howsoever the case stands, but the second
man is poor, and has neither penny nor pennies worth, and he desires alms.
Thus do both twain of them match just in one point, for they desire food as
the thing whereof they have both need. But the first has money to content
his host, and like as he shall have fared well, and bin well and courteously
interteyned: so shall his host receive money of him, and hold him self
contented with it, and not think his guest beholden or bound unto him: For
why, he is recompensed, yea and he has gained by him. But as for the poor
man that craves alms, he thinks him self beholden for his life to him that
fed him, and lodged him: for he brings him nothing but a charge. So then,
if we will be justified before God by the Law, we must deserve it, so as he
may receive of us, and we of him, and there may be as it were an interchaunge
betwixt us. And is that possible? No: as we shall see more at large
hereafter. Therefore we must conclude, that we be excluded from the
righteousness of the Law, and that if we think to bring any thing to bind
God withal, we do but provoke his wrath. Then is there none other shifte, but
to go to him like poor beggars, and so to be justified by faith: not as by a
virtue that is of our selves, but because we confess with all lowliness, that
we can not obtain salvation but by his free gift* Thus ye see how the law
is set here full but against faith, as if S. Paul should tell us, that all
they which go about to win Gods favor by their own merits, forsake the
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. as shall be declared more at length hereafter*
But now if any man say, that the law was given of God, so as it can not have
any contrariety against faith, whereof God is the author also: the answer
thereunto is easy. For God made both day and night, fire and water, cold
and heat. Now it is certain that the day is not contrary to the night: but
we see the wonderful order of Gods goodness and wisdom, in that men have the
light of the sun to do then work in by day, and [the darknesse] as it were
a covert to rest in by night: So then although the day differ from the night:
yet is there no contrariety betwixt them, neither is there any between fire
and water, so each creature be put to his own proper use: but we see that
God has very well agreed the fire and the water, and yet notwithstanding if
(...) behold them fighting together, then is there great contrariety. Even
so is it between the law and the Gospel. And if any body will have a man to
be justified both by the law and by the Gospel to, he does but turmoyle and
mingle things together, and it is all one as if he should set heaven and earth
together by the ears. To be short, it were much easier too mingle fire and
water together, than too say, that we can purchase any grace at Gods hand by
our own deseruings, and therwithall also have need to be succored by our Lord
Jesus Christ. But if a man consider what the law is, and too what purpose it
was given: he shall find that it is not whit at all repugnant too the Gospel,
nor consequently unto faith, but that they agree very well. Thus ye see how
this difficulty is dispatched: so that if it be alleged, that faith comes
of God as well as the Law: it is true. Nevertheless it is to be considered (as
we shall say hereafter) to what end God gave as well the one as the other. But
let us return too that which S. Paul says. He says that we be not
justified but by the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. When he speaks of
being justified, let us mark that it is all one with being reckened or taken
for rightuous before God. And that word had need too be well understood:
for the case stands upon knowing after what manner we be saved. But are we
not wretched caytifes, if after we have lived long in the world, a man ask us
which is the mean too be saved, and we cannot tell him? We shall see many
beastly wretches, which have devoured Gods bread, and yet notwithstanding
cannot tell how they should offer themselves before him. And therefore it
behooves us to take so much the better heed to the things which are taught us
here by S. Paul. He says that we be justified: and how? Is it that we be
rightuous, and that there is nothing amiss in us? No: but it is for that God
accepts us. Then is the word Righteousness put for the favor which God
shows us, in that he voutchsafeth too be our father and too take us for his
children. If a man demand why the Scripture uses the word Justify, since
it seems too make nothing to the purpose: for it might well be said, God
loves us, God pitieth us, God vouchsafes to become our father and Savior:
[and therfore] why should not men rather use that manner of speech, than say
that he vouchsafes to justify us? [I answer,] it is not without cause that
the scripture speaks so. For if we take the word Salvation rawly, and say
[no more but] that we be saved by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: we shall
not well perceive what our own state is, nor how wretched it is, nor also the
remedy which we must apply too it. For to the intent we may put our trust in
our Lord Jesus Christ, we must understand that we be utterly forlorn as well
by reason of the sin of Adam, as by reason of the infinite number of
iniquities wherein we be saped: yea and we must fully believe it. But we
should never perceive that our sins condemn us and curse us before God,
except we knew that we have need of righteousness. And on the otherside we
should not know Gods righteousness, if we should singly say that we be saved
by faith and by grace. For God cannot once renounce himself, because he is the
sovereign righteousness, and there is nothing in him but pureness and
perfection, by reason whereof he must needs hate evil. Now it is so that we
be full of corruption, there is nothing but evil in us: and therefore God must
needs hate us. And if he hate us, woe worth us: for then are we damned. Then
stands it us on hand to be made rightuous, before we can be in Gods favor.
That is to say, it behooves us to be purged of our faults and misdeedes, for
else (as I said) we shall never be able to conceive, that God intends too
show us mercy. But in acknowledging our selves too be sinners, we perceive
by and by that God must needs hate sin, and that although he hate sin,
yet not withstanding he finds means to save us, which is by forgetting our
offenses, and by clenzing and purging them with the blood of our Lord Jesus
Christ, who is our spiritual washing. God then purges us in that wize, too
the end we should be received of him, and being made parttakers of his love,
be assured of our salvation. Thus ye see why the Scripture uses the word
Justify: But the Papists descant upon it like blind buzzardes. What, say
they? should we be justified by faith? Faith is no such virtue as makes men
perfect: and how then shall it make us rightuous? They consider not that this
righteousness whereof the Scripture speaks, is Gods covering of our sins
(as I declared before) and his taking of them quyte and clean away for the sake
and by the mean of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the virtue of the Sacrifize
of his death and Passion. How soever the case stands, it is said that we be
counted rightuous before God, because he releaseth and forgiueth our sins.
Romans 4. a. 6*
And after the same manner does Saint Paul speak of it in the fourth to the
Romans, where he says that David has well declared in effect, Psalm. 32. a.
1.
how we be justified by faith, when he says. Blissed is the man whose
iniquities God has forgotten, and whose sins he has covered. And in another
place he says, 2. Cor. 5. d. 21.
that our Lord Jesus Christ who knew no sin, nor had any spot in him, was
made sin for us: that is too say, received all the condemnation of our
faults, too the end that we should become Gods righteousness in him, that is
too say, too the end that being greffed into his person, and made one body
with him, we might be taken for rightuous, because there was such perfectness
in his obedience, that our sins were buried and rid quite and clean away.
Thus much concerning the word Justify* Now as touching the word Faith [or
belief,] S. Paul adds for a declation, that they had believed in Jesus
Christ. If a man ask an unlearned person what Faith is: he will perchance
answer that it is too believe: but he shall not be able too tell what is meant
or imported by any of them both. Will we then have the understanding of them
according too the raw capacity of the vnskilfullest sort? We must always
mark, that our Lord Jesus Christ is set too be the butte of our faith and
belief. Do we obtain salvation by faith? It is as much too say, as we
believe in our Lord Jesus Christ. But let us now consider why our Lord Jesus
Christ is set before our eyes for our faith too ame at, and too rest wholly
upon. It is because we shall find in him what soever belongs too the
making of us rightuous. I have told you already, that we be taken for
rightuous before God when he forgiueth our sins, and calls the^ not too
account any more. And how shall we obtain that, but by the blood of our Lord
Jesus Christ which was shed to wash us withal? For in as much as he has made
full amends for us by his death and passion: therefore God is appeazed
toward us, condicionally that we seek not to pay him with any other thing,
than with the sacrifize that was offered up to him by his only son our Lord
Jesus Christ, who is called Gods well beloved son, Math. 3. d. 17.
too the end that we should be beloved in him: and the rightuous, to the end
we should be made parttakers of his righteousness: Esaias. 53. d. 11.
and the holy, too the end we should be made holy in him. Thus then ye see
why we must have an eye to our Lord Jesus Christ, Luke. 1. d. 35.
when we intend too know what the word Faith imports. But the Papists
stand wilfully in their own conceyt, because they never tasted what it is to
believe: and that do they show well enough by their allegacions. How is it
possible (say they) that a man should be justified by believing, seeing that
the very Devils do believe? James. 2. d. 20.
It is true, and S. James uses the same reason. How beit in that place he
mocketh at such as pretend a vain and fond cloak of Christianity and faith,
and in the mean while show no fruits at all of it. But the Papists beguyle
themselves yet much more grossly, in saying that Faith is too believe in God,
and that God is the mark that faith ameth at, so as it seems too them, that
too make up belief, there needs no more but to imagine that there is some
one certain God that made the world, and which governs all things. And so
they fall fast a sleep in their ignorance, and yet cease not too take
themselves for good Christians and Catholics (as they themselves babble)
although they be altogether dulled in deed. But it is no wonder that they
fight so against the doctrine of the holy Scripture, and with such vnamendable
wilfulness deny that a man can be saved by faith, seeing they have another
discretion nor understanding: for they wot not what the matter meeneth. So
much the more therefore does it stand us upon, too mark well what Saint
Paul tells us here: that is too wit, that if we look not unto Jesus
Christ, we know not what faith is. And the reason thereof is, for that we
know not what it is too have forgiveness of sins, to come unto God, to be
able to put our trust in him, and to call upon him: another do we know any more
what it is to have our consciences quiet, and to hope for the everlasting life.
All these things we want till Jesus Christ be set before us, and till we have
cast our look upon him, so as all our senses be settled upon him, and as it
were shet up there. Ye see then that the faith whereby we obtain grace, is
that after we once know our selves to be wretched creatures, and that there is
nothing but loath somnesse in us, we seek the remedy of it in our Lord Jesus
Christ, and understand that he was offered up for us to redeem us from the
curse wherein we were plundged, that he has made us clean by his blood, that
by his obedience he has put away all our offenses, and that for the same we
be assured that God accepts and receives us for his children. Thus ye see
how this text is to be understood. And whereas S. Paul says, that he
himself and all the Jews that were converted unto Christianity, did look
too be saved by the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ: he adds also the reason
why: namely, because no flesh shall be justified by the works of the Law. He
had well used that word, if he had applied it but to his own countrymen: but
here he speaks of all men in general. And whereas he says no flesh at
all: first he betokens that the Jews differ nothing at all from the Gentyles
in the mean of obtaining salvation. Wherefore although the Jews being
circumcyzed, were taken as it were for Gods heritage, and sanctified unto him:
yet not withstanding they could not have any hope of salvation, but by his mere
grace. Lo how they be matched with the Gentyles and raunged in like degree with
them. Again, S. Paul meant here to deface utterly all the over weening that
men conceive of their own virtues. There are many which know they have ouershot
themselves so far, that they cannot chalendge any glory too them as though
they had deserved aught at Gods hand. VVretched drunkardes, unthrifts, and
such as have given themselves over to all naughtiness, will be ashamed to
auaunce themselves, and too brag that they can bind God by their deserts and
well doings, for even before me^ they be feign too hide themselves because of
their lewdness. But as for those that have some cloak of hypocrisy, and show
some sign of holiness before men: they by and by become drunken with it, and
so harden themselves, that they believe they deserve Paradyse, and that God is
greatly bound unto them. Of which suit are these Popeholy ones, who although
they be full of al filthiness, so as there is nothing in them but ambition,
covetousness, cruelty, and such other like things: yet how soever the world
go, for as much as they have good store of their Churchstuffe and other
counterfettings, they bear themselves in hand that God sees not a whit intoo
their lewdness, but persuade themselves that God ought to accept them for
their own merits sakes. Also, such as hear Mass devoutly, such as ru^ne
from the Tavern [or from the Alehouse] to the Chapel, specially such as buy
pardons and such other like stuff, and such as keep fastingdayes and
holidays, will be puffed up with such an over weening, as to think they have
bound God unto them. But S. Paul, in naming all flesh, shows that men must
not shole out themselves asunder, as though one were righteous, though another
were not so: but must all stoop and humble themselves and pass condemnation,
assuring themselves that all their virtues, (yea eue^ of the excellentest men
of all) are but filthiness before God. For although a man be perfectly
rightuous to our opinion, so as he does noman harm, but has steadfastness in
himself to withstand all vices, and is chaste and sobre, and (to be short) is
taken and esteemed to be as an Angel: yet not withstanding he has nothing in
him but corruption. And how can that be? Because we may not rest upon the
outward appearance, for (as the Proverb says) all is not gold that
glistereth. It is not for us to judge what is vice, and what is virtue, except
we could enter into a man. For if a man yield not unto God that which
belongs unto him, what is to be said of it? He robs not men, but he
robs God of his honor. Again though men give him never so great praise and
clap their hands at him: yet shall he but burst for vaynglorie and pride, and
nothing shall be able too frame him too humility, save the knowing of our Lord
Jesus Christ. So then, they which make a goodly outward show in their life,
shall nevertheless be still condemned before God. This is the thing whereby S.
Paul intended to forestall all the vain trust that men can co^ceyue or
nurrish concerning their own deseruings. But there is yet more. For he speaks
not only of such men as were after a fort forsaken of God, and were not renewed
by his holy spirit: but when he says All flesh* he co^prehendeth the
faithful also. For although Gods holy spirit dwell in us after he have drawn
us to the knowledge of his Gospel and greffed us into the body of our Lord
Jesus Christ: although (say I) that Gods spirit dwell in us: yet are we al
comprehended under the word Flesh, in respect of that which we have of our
own: S. Paul then gives sentence here, that no flesh shall be justified,
because the faythlesse are condemned in Adam, and abide in their condemnation,
and the faithful are always imperfect, so as they have many vices and
blemishes: by means whereof they be condemned as well as the other, and so
this comdemnation is general, That he which will be justified by the works
of the law, shall always be found guilty, yea even the holiest men that ever
were. Let us take Abraham who was a mirror of all perfection: let us take
David who excelled in all virtue: 1 Ezech. 14. b. 14.
Let us take Noe, Job, and Daniell who are reckened up for three rightuous men
by the Prophet Ezechiell: and let us take such other like: and yet
nevertheless, even they also are raunged in the same array, that is too wit,
that they could not obtain righteousness before God, but by Grace. Now then
I pray you what shall we do? must not the Devil needs drive them headlong
intoo terrible pride, which at this day do stay still, that they may be
justified by their own deserts or meritorious works as they term them? For
who is he that can match either David, Noe, Abraham, or Daniell? Had not men
need too have profited well in Gods school, and to be inflamed with a true
zele of giving themselves wholly unto him, that they may be utterly
convicted, that they be yet very far of from being come to the point which
we see David, Noe, and Daniell too have bin at ^ For as much then as we know
this: let us mark, that here the holy Ghost beats down such as mount
up too high, too the end we should be the more ashamed that we have not
one drop of deserte of glory: and seek all that pertayneth too our salvation,
in the mere grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Thus ye see that this saying
where Saint Paul auoweth that no flesh shall be justified, ought too be
understood as though he had said* If men look upon themselves in their
own nature, they shall find nothing but evil, notwithstanding all the fair
shows that they can have. They may well be highly praised and esteemed in the
world, and they may well beguyle themselves by vain self soothings: but
until such time as God have wrought in them too change them, it is certain
that there shall be nothing in them but filthiness, and all the virtues that
men make account of, shall be stark vice, too lead them too destruction and too
plundge them in Hell. For although that they which are renewed by Gods grace
and have already profited in his obedience, have some virtues which he loves
and esteems: yet are they not able to bring aught that may pass account
before him: for they shall always find themselves in arrerages. And that
goodness which is in them, they have it of him, and yet is that goodness
also corrupted with their sins and infirmities: by reason whereof they are
utterly bereft of all trust in their own righteousness: and so if we now
seek our righteousness in the law, we be beguyled, we shall not find it
there, we be al of us condemned from the greatest too the least. But here we
see much better that which I touched before: namely that when we perceive and
find by experience, that we want all that ever pertayneth to the life of our
souls: we must resort to Jesus Christ as to our refuge, so that the true
preparatiue to make us believe in Jesus Christ, is to be touched with a lively
co^ceyt and feeling of our own sins. And for the same cause also he says,
Math. 11. d. 28.
Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will refresh you,
and you shall find rest to your souls. Esai. 61. a. 2
Again it is said expressly, that he is sent to preach the message of gladness
to the poor, to set free such as are in prison, and to comfort such as are
utterly oppressed and as it were overwhelmed. Those then which take pleasure in
their sins, will never come at our Lord Jesus Christ. True it is that they
will boast enough of faith, according as many skorners of God do unhallow that
word as holy as it is. Every man will be counted a Christian, and they that
be furthest out of square in all wickedness, will say they believe as much as
any other man. But when a man speaks after that manner, it is a token that he
has not one drop of faith. For the faithful will surely say, I believe,
howbeit with so great weakness, that I see well if my God should not pity
me, that little which I have would soon vanish away utterly. Therefore they
that vau^t with full mouth that they have a perfect faith, are but dogs and
swine which never tasted what the fear of God or what religion is. But how
soever the world go, the name of faith shall be shamefully defiled by those
dogs, which do nothing else but mock God. For they have no skill too
discern between good and evil. They be so blockish, that they do as it
were welter in their filthiness: insomuch that a gross drunkarde that is past
all shame, and therewithal has ouerglutted himself also, would feign
continue still in his disordinatenesse. Besides this, the whoremongers, the
periurers, the blasphemers, and such other like will protest welynough that
they have faith: but yet for all that, it is certain that they were never in
any towardness to come to our Lord Jesus Christ. And why so? For they have
not considered that they cannot be justified but by grace. Howbeit let us
mark, that to be thoroughly peswaded, that we cannot be justified by the law,
we must set God before us in his judgment seat, and every of us summon our
selves before him, and morning and evening bethink us that we must yield up
an account of our whole life. Thereupon let us understand, that we should be
overwhelmed a hundred thousand times, if God should not pity us, and bear
with us of his infinite mercy. That is the way for us to know that we cannot
be justified by the law: for we be as good as damned, so often as we appear
before God. It is meet for us to be put in such fear, as we may have neither
releace nor rest, till our Lord Jesus Christ have succored us. Ye see then
how it behooves us to be laden and fortrauelled, that is too say, to mislyke
of our sins, and to be grieved with such anguish, as we may be pinched with
the sorrows of death, to the end we may seek all our ease in God, assuring
our selves that we cannot otherwise obtain salvation, neither whole nor in
part, but must be feign to have it given us. For S. Paul does not set down any
mean way here, as though he said that we should find that which we want,
in Jesus Christ, and be able to have the rest of our selves. But he says that
forasmuch as we know once that we cannot be taken as righteous for our own
deserts, nor for our own works, only faith must content and suffize us.
Wherefore let us understand, that there is not one whitte of our salvation
out of Jesus Christ, but that we have there both the beginning and the end of
it, that is to say every whit of it: and let us abide continually in that
lowliness, knowing that we bring nothing with us but damnation, and that all
that ever perteyneth to our salvation must be received of Gods only free
mercy, so as we may say that it is by faith that we be saved, that is too say,
because God the father has appointed his son our Lord Jesus Christ for us
to rest upon, that he might both begin and finishe our salvation, in such wise
as the whole must be fathered upon him, and we learn to renounce our selves,
and to give our selves fully and wholly unto him.

And now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God with
acknowledgement of our sins, praying him too make us so to feel them, as we
may mislike more and more of them, and grow and go forward in the amendment
wherein we ought too spend our whole life, and learn too magnify his
goodness in such wise, as it has bin showed to us in our Lord Jesus Christ,
so as we may be wholly ravished with it: and that the same may be, not a
glorying of it with our mouth only, but a putting of our whole trust in him,
so as we may be settled in it more and more, till we be gathered up intoo the
everlasting life, where we shall have the reward of our faith. That it may
please him to grant this grace, not only to us, but also to all people. etc.

The. 13. Sermon, which is the seventh upon the second Chapter.
17 But if we that seek to be justified by Christ, be found to be
sinners: is Christ therefore the minister of sin? No not so,

18 For if I build up the things again which I had cast down, I make my
self an offender.


We have seen already, that to beat down all the pride and selftrust which
men put in their own works and merits, Paul alleged that the Jews who had
great preferment above other men, could not for all that come in Gods favor,
otherwise than by believing the Gospel. Yet notwithstanding it was a good
likelihood that the Jews had some righteousness in themselves wherewith too
win Gods favor, because the law was given to them, with promise that
whosoever performed those things should live in them. Leu. 18. a. 5.
Therefore a man would have judged, that the Jews even in respect of
themselves alone without Christ, might after a sort have bin justified before
God: otherwise it should seem that the law was superfluous. But when they
come too our Lord Jesus Christ, there they perceive themselves to be wretched
sinners, forlorn, and damned. It should seem then, that Jesus Christ brings
sin: for before his coming, the Jews were reckened for Gods children. Deu.
7. a. 6.
They bare the badge of holiness in their bodies, and moreover it was said
unto them, that they were the holy and chosen people of their God. Now then
seeing they become fellowlike with wretched sinners, and there is nothing but
cursednesse to be found in them, so as they be feign to flee for refuge to the
mere grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: it seems that Jesus Christ brought sin
intoo the world. Truly so will men judge of him after their own opinion,
howbeeit foolishly. For it behooves us to mark, that our Lord Jesus Christ
does not bring sin, but bewray sin. For although the Jews exercised
themselves in the keeping of the law: yet did that serve but to prove unto them
still more and more, that God would never show them mercy, but by the mean
of the Redemer. No doubt but that in living chastely and soberly, and
therwithall in walking in obedience to god, they had some show of
righteousness: but that came wholly of grace, and we must not father that thing
upon men, which belongs unto God, for by that means God should be defrauded
of his honor. Then if the Jews being governed by Gods spirit, had some
willingness and desire to lead a holy life: it must not come in account, as
who should say, that God were beholden to them for it: for contrariwise they be
so much the more bound unto God. But on the otherside, we have too mark (as
we shall see more fully in due time and place) that there was never yet any
man so perfect, but there was always much to be blamed in him. Therefore we
have to conclude, that the Jews could not be so well taken and accepted at
Gods hand, but that they had need of his mercy, and that their salvation must
needs be grounded wholly upon the forgiveness of their sins. Also as in
respect of Ceremonies, they bare themselves on hand that there was great
holiness in them, as whereof hypocrites have always made their cloak. But
howsoever they fared, it is certain that the Jews were more damnable than all
other men. And why? For (as Saint Paul says) without the law sin does not
vpbrayde men: To. 5. b. 13.
insomuch that men fall asleep and flatter themselves in their vices, when
they have not that Sumner to cite them before Gods judgment seat. Then
whereas the wretched Gentiles might have some defense and excuse, at least wise
that they be not so guilty before God: the Jews in offering their sacrifizes
had it witnessed too their face, that all of them were worthy of eternal
death, and so consequently double guilty in comparison of the Gentiles. And
therefore in the second to the Collossians S. Paul uses this similitude, Col.
2. c. 14.
that the Ceremonies of the law were as evidences to bind a man the more.
Truly like as although a detter be not condemned by order of law, nor have
bound himself before a notarie nor given assurance in writing under his hand
and seal: yet ceasseth he not for all that, to be bound [in conscience] too
pay his debt: even so although the Gentyles had not any authentical matter of
record whereby to be condemned: yet ceased they not too be still worthy of
death. But as for the man that has passed bonds by order of law, and entered
his debt in the common records: what shall he say more? There is no shift for
him: he must be feign too answer [the debt] out of hand. Now the Jews were
in the like plight. For their washing of themselves when they went intoo the
Temple, and in their own houses, and every where else, was a confessing that
there was nothing but uncleanness in them. Again, when they killed the
beasts, and saw them slain before the^, surely the same was as a lively
picture of their own death and cursed state. And yet could not the brute
beasts nor the shedding of their blood set them clear: nor likewise the
water, which is a corruptible element, and cannot come at the soul. So then,
the washing which they used had bin a fond thing, if it had not directed them
to the spiritual washing which we have in our Lord Jesus Christ. Likewise in
baptism at these days, if we think our selves to be made clean by the water:
what an abuse is it? All these things must serve to lead us to the blood of
our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore I conclude, that whereas the Jews were
exercysed in the law, the same was a greater evidence against them, and bound
them straightlier to subjection unto Gods judgment, and eternal death, than
the Gentiles were. And so we see how Jesus Christ was not a bringer in of
sin, but a discouerer of sin. For the Jews thought themselves well
shrouded under the Ceremonies, and made a sheelde of them to fence themselves
from gods displeasure, esteeming all other Nations unholy, upon opinion that
there was nothing but uncleanness in all the world besides, and that all
holiness was in themselves. Lo what their bravery was. Yea, but when Jesus
Christ came and put them in order: he showed them that they should be feign
too show other men by their own example, that their salvation was too be
sought elsewhere than in their own merits, and that it behooved them to come
to him with such humility, as too confess that they on their part brought
nothing with them but utter cursednesse. And by that means our Lord Jesus
Christ discovered the mischief that had bin hidden before, like as diseased
persons shall oftentimes not perceive the festering of some sore that will
breed some deadly disease, till the Surgeon find it out, who cannot do his
duty in curing it, till he have searched the sore to the bottom which was
unknown before. Even so was our Lord Jesus Christ feign too bewray the
wretchedness that was in the Jews, to the intent they should return unto
him, and confess that they had not any thing in them worthy of Gods favor,
nor any other refuge than unto his mere mercy. Thus ye see in effect what we
have to consider for the solution of the question and doubt which Saint Paul
puts forth here. Likewise in these days, if a man speak of the Gospel
too such as think they serve God, and hope to win heaven by their own
deserts: they be grieved at it, because that that gate is shet against them by
the presumptuousnesse which they have conceived before hand, saying: What I
pray? Shall I have lost my time when I have bin so devout all my life long? As
for the man that shall have heard a Mass or twain, or mumbled up a sort of
prayers, or gone on pilgrimage, or lashed out his money and substance (without
sparing) upon pardons, indulgences, and such other things: if one tell him that
we be all wretched, and that there is none other thing for us too lean unto
but the mere grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that all that ever we are
able to bring unto God is but filthy and lothly, he will storm and reply, Is
it possible that God should have no regard of so great pains as I take to
serve him? Must not all of it pass in mine accounte, and be allowed me too
my salvation? They would feign accuze God, yea and we shall see many that
will not stick to rail upon him with open mouth, because they be loathe to
lose that which they have done. Although the Hypocrites perceive much lewdness
in themselves: yet would they feign hyde all under their cowles. For they
break out after this manner. One says I have gone woolwarde: another, I have
risen at midnight to serve God: the third, I have forborne the eating of
flesh: and another, I have bin shette up in a Cloister as in a prison, and
finally I have bin dead to the worldwarde, and shall all this be unprofitable
too me, so as God will have no regard of it? Such murmurings as these we
shall hear daily. But let us see if they can make their case the better for
all their replying? For when they have well examined what is in them, they shall
find that all their doings are but as a paynting to ouercast things withal,
like as a man that inintendeth not too repair his house, leaves the holes
vnmended within, and does but dawb them over on the outside too the end they
be not seen, and afterward whytelymes them, so that finally it is nothing
else but a pargetting or whitelyming, according also as our Lord Jesus Christ
uses the same similitude against the hypocrites that did no more but blaunche
things. Math. 23. c. 27.
Howbeeit in the mean while God regards not the outward appearance, as it
is said in the first of Samuel, 1. Sam. 1^. b. 7.
but searches men's hearts and the truth, and [layeth open] the things that
were hidden before, according also as it is said in Jeremy. Ierem. 5. a. 3
Since it is so: then all such as allege or set forth their own devotions,
may peradventure have some fair show before men: but surely, before God all is
but leasing. And as soon as God does but blow upon their painting and
starche, it shall scale off like the painting of harlots that take great pain
too starch their faces, and yet the Sun does no sooner shine upon them, but
a man shall see the filthy scales fall off, and their foulness is discovered
to their shame. In like taking are all hypocrites when they will needs color
things after that manner before God: their shameful lewdness must needs be
brought too light. Wherefore let us mark, that our Lord Jesus Christ in
condemning the whole world, by showing that none can be saved but by the free
goodness of God his father, the which he offers and imparteth unto us:
brings not sin, (for we have that already in us,) but utters and
bewrays it, too the end we should be convicted of it, and all the pride
wherewith we were made drunken before be laid down, and nothing remain in us
but lowlynesse too confess unfeignedly that we be undone, and that there is
none other shifte for us, but that God utter the infinite treasures of his
mercy upon us. Ye see then that all mouths shall be stopped, and men must
not beguile themselves any more by surmyzing to find any righteousness in
themselves. And furthermore S. Paul uses here a dubble answer, too show
that it is nothing so. Howbeit before he answer, he sets down a precyze
word, saying: God forbid. As if he should say, it is an horrible blasphemy
too intend to lay the blame of our sins upon our Lord Jesus Christ. Eor
(says he) if I pull down the thing that I have builded up, there shall be
contrariety [in me.] And in speaking so, he brings us back to the common
doctrine of the Gospel. For our preaching of the end whereunto God has sent
his only son, is too show that he has brought us righteousness, and is
come too put away sin, which holds us as it were under Tyranny, till we be
delivered and set free from it by the grace which was purchaced for us in the
death and passion of the Son of God. Now then seeing it is so, we see that
our Lord Jesus Christ is not the bringer in of sin, 1. John. 3. a. 8.
but is come too destroy sin (as S. John says in his Canonical Epistle)
and we also do see it to be so. For what else does the Gospel teach us, but
that we be full of all wickedness, and must be feign to be made clean by
him that is made the Lamb without spot, and also that he has brought us the
spirit of holiness? For as much then as me^, so long as they be cut off from
Christ, have nothing in the^ but cursednesse, so as they be utterly rotten and
saped in their sins, and that Jesus Christ is the party that makes the^ pure
and clean by the sheading of his blood to wash the^ withal, and by bringing
us the spirit [of regeneration.] to renew us with, that we might give our
selves too the serving of God, have his Image repaired in us, and walk in
truth and uprightness: forasmuch (say I) as it is said so: we see that our
Lord Jesus Christ is not the bringer in of sin. And why so? For let us
consider what we be, and we shall find that there is a gulf of all manner of
wickedness in every one of us, and in all mankind. But our Lord Jesus Christ
comes to remedy it. Ye see then that the sin was in us before: but our
Lord Jesus Christ is feign to uncover it. What harm does a Physician by
letting blood? Behold, a wretched man has a disease that is not perceived:
his blood is altogether corrupted, and yet it is not seen to be so as long as
it lies within the veins. But be he once let blood, it will appear that it
was no blood, but filthy corrupt matter. Again what filthiness voydeth out
of a man's body when he is purged for some disease? Now shall the Physician be
blamed for it, or the medicine that was given him? It is well known that the
purgation serves to deliver the body that was half rotten before. So then if
our Lord Jesus Christ do by the light of his Gospel bewray the spiritual
diseases that were in us, and the filthy uncleanness which is lothly before
God, and shameful before men, and do purge us quite and clean thereof: ought
he to be charged with any blame or reproach for his labor? What an
unthankfulness were that? therefore here is a sufficient answer to beat
back the blasphemies and grudgings of the enemies of the Gospel, which burst
for pride and cannot endure to be tamed. Let them allege what they can too
prove that they have some righteousness and holiness: and yet shall it
always be found that there is nothing but uncleanness in them, which they
wist not of, and yet it shows it self continually. Mark that for one point.
And secondly Saint Paul adds a more large and easy declaration, when he
says, that he is dead too the lawwarde by the law it self: and that he was
crucified with Jesus Christ, to live unto God. Now when as he says that he
was dead to the lawwarde by the law: it is in way of mocking such as pretend
too be justified by keeping of the law. For I have told you already how all
his disputing and stryuing was against such kind of folk. They were but
deceyuers which went about to mingle Jesus Christ with the law of Moses, yea
even too get righteousness. For it is certain that our Lord Jesus Christ is
not contrary too the law, but rather his Gospel takes witness of the law,
as it is showed in the first chapter too the Romans. Romans 1. a. 2.
Nevertheless, when the matter concerns Justification, that is too say, when
men come too scanning, too know how and by what means God takes and
accepts them for innocent, pure, and without spotte, then must the law be
separated from Jesus Christ. And why? For the law brings nothing in it but
cursing: and Jesus Christ brings the remedy of it. Therefore the enemies of
the Gospel against whom S. Paul does now dispute, would have mingled the
law with it, and have made men believe, that although they were justified by
our Lord Jesus Christ, yet notwithstanding they should mingle the Ceremonies
with him as a part of their salvation, and that by means of them they should
purchase grace and favor before God. But S. Paul cutteth off all this gear,
and says that there is none but only Jesus Christ [that can do that] and that
men must seek none other helps in that case either one way or other, but
simply content them selves with his grace, and not give the law any room in
that behalf. For he says, as for me I am not dead through the Gospel. As
if he should say, will ye make me believe that I can get Gods favor by
means of the law? Nay, I tell you contrariwyse, that it is not the Gospel
which has condemned me, it is not the Gospel that has showed me my
filthiness, to make me ashamed of it* it is not the Gospel that has berefte
me of all hope of salvation: but it is the Law, which has showed me that I am
stark dead, that I am dampnable before God, that I am undone and damned: This
comes not from elsewhere than from the law. And would ye have me too seek
righteousness there? It is all one as if ye would give me a poison to eat,
to the end I should take nourishment of it. Howbeit (to say truth) that
inconvenience is not to be wyted upon the Law, for it should redounde to the
dishonor of God, from the Law came. But howsoever the case stand, 2. Cor. 3.
b. 7
considering the corruption that is in us, the Law can not but kill us, as we
have seen in the second too the Corinthians, Romans 7. b. 9
and as S. Paul declares more fully in the seventh to the Romans. For he
says, that when men believe them selves too have life: that is too say, when
they believe themselves to be righteous, and to stand in the grace and favor
of God: it is a sign that the law is dead to them, that is to say, that it
has not the power and strength to show them that which else it should do. For
to what end was the law given? Too set the rule of good life before our eyes,
and that rule is called the righteousness which God allows. Mark that for
one point. Secondly the law ought to be as a looking glass to us, wherein too
behold our own deformities, blemishes, foulness, filthiness, and
iniquities, so far out of all order, as we may be as it were swalowed up in
despair at the sight of them. Now before we have the law, we see none of
all these things: that is too say, we know not what manner of ones we be, nor
what evil is in us. But when God sets his demaundes before us, and we
perceive the same thoroughly: then are we at our wits end, and utterly out
of hope. The Law then is dead: that is to say, it is as it were thrust under
foot and as good as buried, so long as we think our selves to be alive, and
conceive any foolish imagination of being righteous, and of obteyning heaven
by our own good works. But when the law lives: that is too say, when God
gives it power to touch us, then are we dead, then is it as a sword to
thrust us too the heart. Therefore we must needs receive a deadly wound, so
soon as we have perceived what the Law conteyneth. After that manner speaks
S. Paul in the text which I have alleged. And now following the same
matter, he says, that he is dead too the Law by the Law: as if he had said,
Come not hither too slander the Gospel, as though it were the cause of our
damnation, or an entrance unto us too be cursed before God, too have the
knowledge of the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in us. No no. But it is
certain that the Law (when it does his office, and we read it in such
wise as becomes us) does always kill us, and we lie as it were plunged in
despair, till our Lord Jesus Christ have reached us his hand too lift us
out of it. Thus then am I dead unto the law, that is too say, I can have no
life, I can have no assurance of soul health, I can have no comfort, rest nor
contentation, and to be short, there: is nothing in the law whereby I may come
unto God: but clean contrariwise, it shakes me off, it thrusts me back, it
banisheth me from the kingdom of heaven, it cutteth me quite off from the hope
of salvation, it makes me a poor, cursed, and wretched creature, and to be
short, it sends me to the bottom of hell. Ye see then what I have won by
abiding in the law. And S. Paul speaks of him self rather than of any
other body, to the end that the things which he speaks, may be the better
received, as of a man of experience. And it is after the same manner that he
speaks in the fore alleged seventh Chapter too the Romans. Romans 7. b. 9
For there he sets not forth this man or that man for an example, but
says, I my self was sometimes alive: that is too say, at such time as he
was a Pharisie, and accounted an holy man, yea even for one of the excellentest
in all Iewry, in so much that he was a myrrour of all perfection, and as a
little Angel: then (says he) I was alive, howebeeit but by hypocrisy. For
he made him self too believe wonders, and he was so puffed up with pride, Romans
7. b. 8
that he hilde scorn of Jesus Christ. Lo in what blindness Saint Paul
acknowledges him, self too have been. And he adds anon after, that he
wist not what was meant by, Thou shalt not covet. It might be thought
strange that a man which had not only bin at school, but also bin a great
teacher of others, and thereto a very zealous man as he him self affirms,
should be so dulled as not to know his own faults. But S. Paul shows the
reason of it. For (says he) I looked no further than to the outward honesty,
that there might no fault be found in me before the world, nor any man know
any evil by me. But when I understood what this saying, Thou shall not lust
meant, and perceived that God condemns all the affections, and thoughts of
men: then I perceived that the worst was behind, as the common Proverb says:
for it is the last commandment of the law, wherein God makes so lively, and
deep a search as nothing can be excepted from it. Exo. 20. a. 3
VVheras it is said in the law. Thou shalt not have any strange gods: Thou
shall not make any image too worship it: Thou shalt not take the name of the
Lord thy God in vain* Thou shall keep holy the day of rest: Thou shall honor
thy father and mother: Thou shall not kill: Thou shalt not commit aduoutrie:
Thou shalt not steal: All this is well (will we think) we must absteyne from
all whordome, violence and extortion: we must absteyne from deceit and
robbery: we must live soberly. Heretoo, we must absteyne from blasphemy, and
we must honor God. All this will easily be granted. But there is a backenooke
that we perceived not, which is, Thou shall not covet or lust: that is a
privy nipper. Truly it seems not too be very big or great: but yet for
all that, it is such a stinger, as passes all the rest in biting. For by the
end and wynding up of his Law, God searches out all that ever is in man. He
sets down that commandment, too try out the things that were hidden: and
when he says, thou shalt not covet, it is a percing even into the marie of
men's bones. So then S. Paul confesses that he knew not what sin mente,
till he understood what was mente by the commandment that forbids men too
covet or lust. And therefore in this text he charge not the Gospel, but the
Law with it. Wherefore let us remember upon this text, that all they which
deceive them selves by any opinion of their own merits, never tasted what the
Law of God is, nor what it means: I speak of the greatest doctors that are
in most estimation, as (in good faith) it is too be seen in the Popedom.
For even those that are taken too be the pillars of the Church,
(notwithstanding that they profess Divinity) know not one word of Gods
law, too apply the same too his true and natural use. For they have nothing
in them but hypocrisy, and they bear them selves in hand, that they shall
please God with a rattle, as if he were a little babe. They do but toye with
him, and yet ye shall see them stand so much in their own conceits, as
they can not abide to be condemned. And if a man tell them that we must seek
our salvation in Jesus Christ: yea say they? and what shall become then of our
freewill? what should become of our own merits and satisfactions? Too their
seeming it were much better too pluck the sun out of the sky, yea and God
out of his seat too, than too bereeue man of that prerogative, or of the thing
that he can bring of him self to co^pound with God and yet for all that, it is
certain that there is nothing in the^ but stark filthiness. For men see that
there is neither fear of God, nor uprightness, nor equity, nor ought else
[that good is] in their life. They be so full of pride that they be ready to
burst again, and they be full of envy, rancour, and all manner of loocenesse.
And yet for all this, they will needs hold God bound unto them: but that is
because they never knew the law. So then, when our Lord teaches us, and
shows us how we ought to walk in this world, let us learn to lay the
doctrine that he sets forth and our life together, and there we shall find
the right perfection of the law, and that in our selves there is nothing but
horrible confusion: we shall see hell ready prepared for us. By that means
it will be easy for us to give over all the deserving which we shall have
fancied in our selves, so as it shall be soon beaten down, and our mouths
stopped, and we become like poor dead folk without any breath, because we
shall perceive well enough, that we can not come unto God, but must needs
thunder against us, if we bring any foolish imagination of our own
deseruings. Lo how the law sleaeth us. But when we have passed through such
death, that is to say, when we be already rightly humbled and utterly
dismayde: then here is a remedy, which S. Paul sets down, saying: I was
crucified with Jesus Christ, eue^ to live unto God. Now he shows here that
our Lord Jesus Christ not only brings us remission of our sins, but also
sanctifies and regenerateth us by his holy spirit, in so much that whereas
there was nothing but stubbornness in us before, now we be given to serve God,
and to please him. And for the better understanding of that which S. Paul
tells us, let us mark that we receive two principal graces of our Lord
Jesus Christ: The one is the forgiveness of our sins, whereby we are assured
of our salvation, and have our consciences quieted, and whereupon it behooves
us to be grounded, so as we call upon God as our father. Who gives us the
boldness to lift up our heads to heaven, and to call God our father? Again,
what makes us so bold as to glory that we be companions and brothers to the
Angels? It is because our sins come not to account: for we must always have
recourse to the washing of them away, which was done by the death and passion
of our Lord Jesus Christ. Ye see then that our righteousness is that God
accepts us, howebeit not in respect of our own worthynesse, but in respect
of the obedience of our Lord Jesus Christ, whereby all our misdooings are
wyped out. That is the first benefit which we have by our Lord Jesus
Christ. The second is, that whereas we be froward of our own nature, and
all that the Papists term by the name of freewill is but frenzy, and that how
great account so ever men make of them selves, all is but naughtiness, and
we be full of vice and corruption: in stead of being so, our Lord Jesus
Christ gives us the grace to be sorry for our sins, and to labor to do good:
for so long as we abide in our own nature, every of us sootheth and flattereth
him self in his evil. But when we have once tasted the inestimable love of
our God, and perceived what our Lord Jesus Christ is: then we be so touched by
his holy spirit, that we condemn the evil, and desire to draw near unto
God, and too frame our selves to his holy will. We be sure of that once, and
although we go halting, yet do we continually sigh to see our own
imperfections and infirmities, and perceive full well how it is the spirit of
God that moves us thereunto, when our chief desire is to forsake the
sinfulness that is in us, and comes of our flesh, so as we wish nothing
else but that God should be glorified in all our life, and faithfully obeyed in
all things. That is the second benefit which our Lord Jesus Christ brings
us: and they be two things knit together by inseperable band, so that like as
the light of the sun can not be separated from his heat: so these two graces
(that is to wit our righteousness, and the remission of our sins) are
unseparably matched with our renewment, which is done by the spirit of
sanctification. Thus ye see two graces inseparable: and like as when we say
that the Sun is whot, it ceasseth not to shine also, and yet notwithstanding
the light of the sun is not heat: so when we say that we be justified by
the remission of our sins, it is not meant that our Lord Jesus Christ does
the^cefoorth suffer him self too be mocked and despised, but that we have
need to be thoroughly cleansed, so as we may learn too renounce the world, and
our selves, too the end to stick unto him with true obedience. Howsoever the
world go, the thing that S. Paul speaks in this text, shall always be
found true, namely that he was crucified with Jesus Christ, to live unto God.
Then if any man accuse the Gospel that it gives liberty to do evil and too
sin: we may always answer, how so? By the law we be always dead, for
there we see our own cursednesse which will leave us dismayde in despair.
But in the Gospel, although we be crucified, that is too say, although
there be a spice of death in the Gospel, yet is that death a quickening
death, and the cause of life. For so long as men live too them selves, they
be dead unto God: they be wretched carcasses full of rottenness. But when
they dye in them selves, they live unto God. And for that cause Saint Paul
in the twelfth too the Romans calls us living sacrifices, Romans 12. a. 1
where he tells us that we must be transformed, and utterly give over our
own reason and our own will, too yield God such service as is meet for him
too have. He says, Offer up your selves as living sacrifices. So then, in the
Law there must needs be a deadly death, a death that leaves us utterly
overwhelmed and sunken even down intoo hell. But in the Gospel there is a
quickening death. And why? For we be crucified with Jesus Christ, too live
unto God, that is too say, Romans 6. a. 4
our old man (as Saint Paul terms it in the sixth too the Romans) and
that which we have of our own nature, is done away, howebeeit not at the
first day, but by little and little. But how soever the case stand, we
shall perceive that our Lord Jesus Christ mortifieth all that was in us of
our own, or of the world, so as we be not so greatly given too nestle here
bylowe, because we see it is a miserable state too live here, and our very
care is too stycke unto God. Thus ye see how we may be crucified with our
Lord Jesus Christ. But what is mente by that crucifying? Verily it is a
certain kind of death. Howebeeit, that death brings us too life, which
thing the death which the Law brings does not. Now then we see the very
intent of Saint Paul, and the natural meaning of this text. Therefore now
a days when the enemies of the truth blaspheme the Gospel, we have here an
answer to stop their mouths. And if they hold on still, let them bark
like dogs, but they shall not be able too byte, do what they can. See here
what the Papists flushe forth when we preach that men are justified
through Gods free goodness. O (say they) are they so? That were the next
way to give every man the bridle too live after his own lyking, and too cause
that there might be no more remorse nor scruple of conscience, so as every man
might have leave too do what he lysted. That is the common blasphemy of the
Papists. Again when we show them that they can not bind us by their
traditions, and that it is but a tyranny which they have usurped in robbing
God of his right, and that the liberty was purchased for us by our Lord
Jesus Christ, to the end that we should not be tide too the things which
men would lay upon us of law and necessity in matters concerning the
spiritual government of our souls. O (say they) see what co^mes of it: their
desire is nothing else but too wallowe in all pleasure, and too lead a loose
life. Surely we may easily answer too all this. For the doctrine that we
bring, serves not to stir up men's lusts, nor to give them too great and
lawless a liberty: but too the clean contrary. But howsoever the case
stand, it ought too suffice us, that if we should abide in the quamyre of
the Papists, surely there would be nothing but death for us. For were they
not too fast asleep and utterly dulled, undoubtedly they should be tossed
with such unquietness and hartebytings, as they should needs see that that
is not the thing whereupon we must rest. But behold, they be so rotted in
their ignorance, that they have not any feelyng of Gods justice at all. But
as for our parts, for as much as we know we have such a freedom
purchased us by our Lord Jesus Christ, and are sure of our salvation because
God does freely forgive all our faults, and do feel already by the working
of Gods holy spirit, that he draws us to him, and are mortifyed to live unto
him: Let us go forward with a cheerful heart. And although there be never
so many infirmities in our nature, yet notwithstanding let us not doubt but God
accepts us, for all our imperfections. But the Papists cannot have so much
as one good purpose to serve God, saving that they be utterly bewitched [to
believe so] through vain selftrust. And why? For they ground themselves upon
their own merits, and (to their seeming) that is the mean to purchase grace.
But now what is it that they can do? Put the case that they brought a hundred
times more with them than they have to bring, and that God governed them by his
holy spirit, so as they had some manner of feeling of the Gospel, though it
were but half a feeling: yet should they come far short of discharging their
duty, yea or of the hundred part of it toward God. But in the mean season,
it is well known that all that ever they do is but pelting trash: and as for
the law of God, it is naught worth with them, and yet in the mean while they
busy their heads about their own inventions. Howbeit let us still put the
case that they endeavored to walk in the fear of God, and that they had
learned aright to do the things that God commands them: yet for all that,
they could not make their boast that they were come to the perfection of that
righteousness which God requires of us. And when they had tormented
themselves never so much, how should they be able to serve God with a cheereful
courage, unless they knew themselves to be in his favor, notwithstanding that
they be so blameworthy before him? But as for us, we on our side are able to
serve God with a free heart, notwithstanding that our consciences find fault
with us, and we know that there are many sins in us. And why? For we ground
not ourselves upon our own merits, but upon Gods mere mercy: and thereby
we be taught, that God receives our works though there be much faultiness
in them, and that we be in his favor although there be many vices and
blemishes in us. And that is the cause why he says by his prophet, Mala. 1. b.
6
that he will accept the seruis which we do unto him, as a father accepts the
seruis of his child. Ye see that a child is willing to obey his father: and
when his father says too him, do this: his father takes his doing in good
worth, though the child know not what he does, yea and sometimes though he
mar a thing, yet his father is contented to lose the thing when he sees that
the child was willing and desirous to serve him. But if a man take a servant
for wages, he will look to have him do his task. And why? For he looks for
his wages: and a man will not abide to have him mar the work that is put
into his hands: yea and if it be not well done, he will not be contented with
it. Now our Lord speaking of the grace of the Gospel, says he will receive our
services, as a father receives the obedience of his child, though all that
ever he does be nothing worth: that is to say, he passes not awhit for the
perfection that is in them, for he shall find none at all in the^: but he
bears with us of his goodness. He shows himself so kind and freeharted
toward us, that whatsoever we do, he takes it in good part, although it be
not worthy, ne do deserve it. Ye see then that the way for us to have a free
courage to serve God, is too assure ourselves that he blisseth all our works,
because that whatsoever spottinesse is in them, is clenzed away by the blood of
our Lord Jesus Christ. To be short, whereas God shows himself pitiful
toward us, and uses inestimable mercy: let us understand that he does it not
to the end that every of us should run a scoterloping, and take the bridle in
his teeth, and play the horse that is broken looce: no no, but contrariwise it
is to the end, that the sword of Gods word should strike us to the heart, and
make such a search there, as we might be rightly humbled to crave pardon at
Gods hand. Not that we should have the hartbiting which the Papists have,
which would pluck us back and hinder us from coming unto God, making us to
say, wretched creature what do thou? What can thou tell whither God love
thee or no? Let us have no such nippes, but let us be fully resolved that God
beholds us with pity, and takes our works in good worth: not for any
desert or worthiness that he finds in them, but because we be joined to our
Lord Jesus Christ. Now therefore we see what Saint Paul meant to say. Also we
see how that doctrine served not for that time only: but that the same is as
profitable and needful for us at this day, as ever it was [for any
heretofore.] For in as much as Gods enemies sight against the Gospel, and spew
out their blasphemies: it stands us on hand to have wherewith to resist them:
and not only them, but also Satan, who has at all times had the slight to make
us believe men, that they could live of themselves and by their own
deseruings: but that is but to lulle us asleep in death. And therefore let us
assure ourselves, that it is better for us to die to the law, than to live to
it: that is to say, let us assure ourselves, that if God should enter into
account with us, we should be utterly undone and damned. And being so dismayed,
let us suffer ourselves to be crucified with our Lord Jesus Christ: and since we
know that he has reconcyled us to God his father by the sacrifise which he
offered, let us also suffer ourselves to be governed by his holy spirit, and to
be renewed by him in such wise, as being dead in ourselves we may live truly
unto God, giving over all ouerweening of our own righteousness, and fighting
against all the lusts of our flesh, and withdrawing ourselves from the world.

And now let us cast ourselves down before the majesty of our good God with
acknowledgement of our sins, praying him too make us so to feel them, as it
may be to pluck us back from the filthiness wherein we be plunged, and to
join us so unto our Lord Jesus Christ, as he may draw us to God his father,
and make us come still nearer and nearer unto him, till we be fully joined
unto him. And so let us all say, Almightye God heavenly father. etc.

The.xiiij. Sermon which is the eight upon the second Chapter.
20. So, I live: [yet] not I now, but Christ lives in me, and whereas I
live now in the flesh, I live by the faith of the son of God, who loved me
and gave himself for me.

21. I refuse not the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law,
then Christ died in vain.


WE have seen this morning to what end we be offered up in Sacrifise unto God,
when our Lord Jesus Christ knitteth us together in his body. It is not to the
end we should lie still in death, wherein we be plunged already by nature:
but rather to make us partakers of the heavenly life. Now the Apostle having
spoken after that manner, magnifyeth Gods grace, saying that he himself lives
not any more, but Jesus Christ in him: which is as much as if he had said, that
all of us by nature have nothing in us but cursednesse, and therefore that
look what good soever God bestows upon us, it becomes us to acknowledge
and confess the same to come of him, and to do him seruis for it. For faith
brings always this humility with it, that men imbace themselves too give
all praise unto God. But by the way it may seem strange, that a faithful man
should boast that Jesus Christ lives in him, and yet be mortal still. So long
as we live in this world, we be subject too many infirmities: and therefore
this saying should seem to be a vain speculation or [fantasticall conceit,]
that Jesus Christ lives in us. But S. Paul brings us back to faith, and
tells us that although our life be corruptible to outward appearance, and we
subject to all the adversities of the world: yet does faith quicken us, so as
our Lord Jesus Christ ceasseth not to make us partakers of his heavenly life,
yea and in very deed we possess it, in so much as we must no more consider the
state of the faithful according too that which may be judged of it by our
natural wit, but mount up higher. For the life which our Lord Jesus Christ
imparteth unto us, is a hidden treasure which we attain not too but by faith
which mounteth above the whole world. Now it behooves us to hope for the things
which we see not, and which are hidden from us: and God is then highly honored
of us, when we make such account of his word and promises, as that all the
things which we see in the world, cannot hold us back from seeking him
continually, and from going to him, and from employing all our wits about him.
Now then, first we have to gather upon this text, that a man has never
profited well in the Gospel, till he father all his welfare upon our Lord
Jesus Christ. For if we reserve never so little to our selves, we be
unthankful to God out of hand: and his grace cannot be darkened by us, but that
we be bereft of it as we are worthy. And therein it appears, that all such as
trust in their own merits, are still full of pride, and as it were mortal
enemies to Gods glory. It is true that they will not profess it with their
mouths: but yet for all that, the hypocrites which hope to be righteous by
their own worthiness, do deck themselves with Gods feathers. Humility is the
principal virtue among all others. For what are all their merits?
Contrariwise, when the faithful humble themselves, it is not to purchase grace
in Gods sight as though they were worthy of it: but to confess as truth is,
that they have not aught whereof too boast, but must receive all things of Gods
mere liberality. At leastwise it serves to make us acknowledge how greatly
we be bound unto him, seeing he has showed himself so kind toward us, as to
spare nothing from us. That therefore is the thing that Saint Paul shows us
here. And it behooves us to wey well the second point where he says, that we
live in the flesh, howbeit by the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. This word
live in the flesh, does in this text signify as much as to be a wayfarer here
upon earth, and too pass through this transitory life. Romans 8. c. ^^
For when he speaks of living in the flesh in the eight to the Romans, he
meeneth to be given to wicked lusts, as they be which have no fear of God, who
give themselves to do what they list. Therefore such as follow their own
swindge like brute beasts, do live in the flesh. But in this place saint Paul
compares this outward life with the heavenly life which we possess by faith.
For how shall a man put a difference between the faithful and the faithless?
As well the one sort as the other do eat and drink. Surely the faithful do
eat and drink soberly. Yea and ye shall see of the faithless sort very well
stayed, and not given to any drunkenness or excess. But howsoever they fare,
a man would deem at the first sight, that this life is common to all men.
Nevertheless, the faithful do oftentimes drag their wings after them, and
nothing else but droope in this world, and finally dye as well as all other
men. Then if a man look but upon the outward show, there is no diversity
betwixt them. To be short, a man might say it is but lost labor to believe in
Jesus Christ. For we receive not here the reward of our faith: and although
God call us to a further thing, yet have we all one common and like life, in
respect that all of us must come to death. How then does Jesus Christ live in
us? For his living is hidden. S. Paul brings us back unto faith. Now
remains to know what the nature of faith is: It is to behold the things that
are incomprehensible to our senses to forsake the world, and to seek the
kingdom of God: and to hold ourselves to the pure and simple word that
proceeds out of Gods mouth, without respect of any thing that we can perceive
here. If we have not this groundworke, we shall never understand what S. Paul
tells us in this text. For when men have red it a hundred times, yet shall
they not know what difference there is between living in the flesh, and living
in the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. Then is there an outward state: in
respect where of S. Paul does (under that saying) comprehend all things that
concern this transitory life. There is also an inward state which is hidden
from us, that is to wit, the state which is promised us, and which we wait for
[by hope.] For the outward man must needs be defaced, and decay by little and
little, til it be utterly done away. According whereunto, although it be
promised to Gods children that God will give them new liveliness, Psa. 103 a 5
and make them as it were to cast their feathers: yet notwithstanding ye shall
diverse times see them so diseased as it is pity, and the strongest men of the
world wax old and come to death. Seeing it is so: what preferment have they
above the unbelievers? [Great:] howbeit that the same cannot be perceived by
eysight. For we have an inward man which lies hidden within us: and what meant
Saint Paul by that? he meant that God works in such wise in us by his holy
spirit, as we be always assured of the heavenly life that is prepared for us,
and that although we do but glide away here below, 2. Cor. 4. d. 16.
and be as strangers, yet there is an everlasting heritage which cannot fail
us. According as the outward man decays (says S. Paul) so the inward man
renueth. For the more that the faithful see themselves decay, the more are
they warned and provoked to look upward. For we know that such as are strong
and lusty, do besot and forget themselves, and therefore our Lord is feign to
tame us in such wise, as we may renew by decaying: I say in such wise as we may
be (as ye would say) new cast in a mould again, to the end that the hope of the
heavenly life may be stablished in us, and we have our sight cleared to behold
the thing which otherwise would be wrapped up from us. Mark how gold and
silver do greatly wast when men make them to pass the furnace. When it is
cast into the fire, it is a great mass of metal: but when it is taken out
again, there is but a small quantity of it. And yet the gold (if it were not so
fined) would never serve to any purpose, no more would silver another. Even so
is it with us: we could never be renewed to come to the kingdom of heaven,
except we dyed first. We must ever go forward to that utter defacement, and
not rest by the way upon any thing that we see with our eyes. For this earthly
life is but a shadow, and a smoke that slideth and vanishes away: and yet
nevertheless we be renewed thereby within. Not that all men have that benefit:
For the faithless do well enough find their own weakness, and are enforced
to feel the summonings of death, specially when they be grown old, for then
they perceive that any little blast is enough to cast the^ down: and thereupon
they fall to storming, and could find in their hearts to fall out with God and
nature. Howsoever the world go, though they rotte, yet are they not renewed.
John. 12. d. 24.
For one grain of corn may well rotte, and yet not take root to spring
again and to bring forth fruit: and another grain shall rot likewise, howbeit
for as much as it is in good earth, and has taken root, it will bring forth
fruit in seasonable time. So the^ the faithful come to decay, and the rewithal
are renewed and gather new force: and why? For they rot in this world, to the
end to be restored and renewed again in the heavenly heritage. The faithless
also do go away to, they rot likewise, they slip aside, and they vanish quite
away: but they have no vauntage by it, because they be not restored to eternal
life. So then let us mark well, that whereas S. Paul says we live by the
faith of Jesus Christ: it is to wake^ us so as nothing in the world may keep
us from resting continually upon Gods promises. When we look upon all the
things that are about us, there is nothing but death. But what for that? God
has given us his word, that being dead in our own nature, we have our life
elsewhere, namely in our Lord Jesus Christ, in as much as he was purposely sent
to bring us from death to life. Seeing then that we have that promise of god, ye
see how he may be honored at our hands. And for as much as the case stands so,
that only saying ought to suffice us. And if we setle and resolve ourselves
fully thereupon: it is a token that we set our hands to Gods truth as
faithful witnesses thereof, John. 3. d. 33
as says Saint John. Contrariwise when we doubt or be in a mamering, then
has Gods word no authority nor reverence among us. For if we look no further
than to the things that are before us, and to the things that are near at
hand: we cannot acknowldge that God is faithful, and that the things which God
has uttered with his own mouth are infallible. Moreover, in so doing we turn
away from our Lord Jesus Christ, who notwithstanding is the pledge of all that
is contained in Gods word. Seeing we have the word, we must no more ask (as
Moses says) who shall climb up above the Clouds? Deu. 30. c. 12
or who shall go down into the deep? or who shall go over the Sea? To. 10. a.
6.
The word (says he) is in thy mouth, and in thy heart: and we must content
ourselves with it. And moreover seeing that we have our Lord Jesus Christ for a
larger confirmation: we know that he went down into the hells, that is to
say, bare the curse that was due to us for our sins, and answered as our
pledge and surety before the judgment seat of his father: and afterward went
up into heaven, and in our behalf took possession of the heritage that he had
purchaced for us. For he was exalted up in our flesh and nature. Seeing that we
have such an assurance, must we not needs be tootoo wretched, if we cannot
hold ourselves too it? 2. Cor. 4. d. 18.
Again, the matter wills us to look still back to that which has bin
said: namely, that we hope, not for things that are open and manifest, but for
the things that are unknown to worldly perceiuerance. Then since it is so, let
us learn to live by the faith of Jesus Christ: that is to say, although we be
miserable in this world and be feign to endure never so many hartbitings,
greefes, anguishes, troubles, and distresses: yet notwithstanding let us
continue in this constancy, of believing that there is nothing but singular
happiness in all our miseries, because God blisseth and halloweth them for our
Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and all is turned to our help and welfare as it is
said in the.viij. to the Romans To. 8. e. 27.
Therefore as we have seen in another text, 2. Co. 12. c. 9
God must utter the perfectness of his strength in our weakness, and we
suffer him to make us to stoop, in such sort as this world may not keep us
back from having the promises of the Gospel thoroughly printed in our hearts,
nor hinder us to be glad and cheerful in the mids of our miseries and
afflictions, nor boldly too dispyze all the slaunderings and mockages of the
faythlesse, when they offer us reproach, saying? Gods, you silly wretches,
think your selves to be princes when you believe the Gospel. But alack poor
souls, where is the joy and happiness which you say is promised you of God?
Where is the inestimable benefit which you make so great account of? For ye
have no more than those who^ you call Gods enemies, reprobates, and cursed
kaytifs. But (as I said) all this geere must not thrust us out of the way: for
we must come back unto faith. Although then that here beneath we perceive
not the things that are promised us in the Gospel: yet let us assure our
selves of them out of all doubt. For (as says S. Paul) our life is hidden,
Col. 3. a. 3.
and the time of the discovery thereof is not yet come. And where is our life
but in our Lord Jesus Christ? Now the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ is
apparent enough: howbeeit, that is but in part: we have but a taste of it: and
things are so troubled and disordered in this world, that if we will judge of
our salvation by the outward appearance, what would become of it? Therefore let
us suffer our life to be hid till our Lord Jesus Christ come, and then shall we
perceive that we have not bin beguiled in putting our trust in him, and in
admitting the doctrine of his Gospel. Ye see then after what manner we must
live by faith: that is to say, we must not be so nyce as to seek a quiet life
here, and too have all our commodities and ease here. For in so doing we
should forgo the thing that God has promised us, we should forget him, and it
would be an utter destruction of our faith. But let us take the myrrour of
Gods word, and there look upon the things that furmount all our wit, and are
set far out of this world, and are utterly invisible: and let us lift up our
eyes thither, not so far forth as our own reason and skill shall be able to guide
us, (for that is not enough) but so as we may climb above the world, and
forsake the present things, to the end to hold our selves fast in Gods
promises, and to be pacient in all afflictions and miseries whereby we shall be
exercized, and against which we must befain to fight, till we receive the fruit
of our victory, when we be conveyed up into the rest of heaven. Thus ye see
what have we to gather upon this saying of S. Paul, which might seem dark at
the first sight: but when we have on the one side marked well what our state is
while we be in this world, and on the other side considered what the nature
of faith is, we shall easily perceive that there is no darkness at all in it.
And now Saint Paul adds expressly, that Jesus Christ loved him, and gave
himself to the death for him. This is an exposition of that which we saw
erewhiles. For men do oftentimes misconster the word Faith, because they
consider not what the pithe of of it is. And in deed every man will be
called faithful, and yet even among those that make profession of
Christianity, ye shall scarce find one of a hundred that has so much as
one drop of faith. For (as I said before) it is never sought what is meant by
faith. The word is very short, but it draws a long tail after it, as we
see by the addition that is set down here. For Saint Paul declares that he
lives by faith, because Jesus Christ had loved him, and delivered himself to
death for him. As much must we do. For inasmuch as we see that the Son of
God; the Lord of glory, the head of the Angels, he by whom all things were
made, and by whom all things are still mainteyned, yields himself to death,
Deu. 21. d. 23
yea and too so vile a death, that he took our curse upon him, and not only
was hanged upon a Cross, which was an yrksome thing to all the world, but
also was pronounced accursed by Gods own mouth: seeing (say I) that we have
such a price to ransom us from death, and too purchase us life and salvation:
have we not cause (if we think well upon it) to ouerleape all the lettes that
Satan can cast in our ways to make us turn head or to retire back, that we
might not continue in the certainty of our faith? Surely the victory will be
easy enough for us against all, remptations, if we can consider of what value
the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ is, and what it imports. So
then S. Paul armeth us here, too the end we might hold out with invincible
constancy, against all the stoppes that Satan labors too lay before us, to
hinder us from keeping on our course. When the faithful are pinched with
hunger or thirst, they be troubled with looking here and there for the
promise that they shall be heirs of the world, and in the mean while do well
near starve for famine and penury. But if they look to our Lord Jesus
Christ, that will dispatche them of all their trouble, and sweeten all the
bitterness that might have put the promises of salvation out of taste with
them. Therefore whenever the faithful are in any peril, or be persecuted,
so as they have many wrongs and injuries done them, and yet are not succored
of all that while: Exo. 25. b. 8
they might think thus with themselves: Psalm. 17. b. 8
Where is God? He has promised to dwell in us, to keep us as the Apple of
his eye, and to be our sheeld and fortress: and yet in the mean while we be
cast up too the spoil, wherefore it is certain that we shall be undone at
every blow. But when we come to the death and passion of our Lord Jesus
Christ, we must conclude that the Son of God was not offered up in vain.
Seeing then that our Lord Jesus Christ spared not himself, but abaced himself
so far as too suffer so slanderous, yea and cursed a death, and afterward
also the pains of Hell, howbeeit but for a while, too the end too set us free
and clear, and too purchase us grace before the judgment seat of God his
father: should that doing of his be vnauaylable? Is it possible that it
should be? No: For if Heaven and earth were turned vpsyde down, it were not
so great a confusion, as too imagine that the Son of God has suffered in
vain. Then see we now why Saint Paul tells us that he lived by faith.
For it behooves us to be settled upon the death and passion of our Lord Jesus
Christ, assuring our selves that it is able enough too draw us out of the
dungeons of death.

And furthermore it behooves us* too look upon our Lord Jesus Christ, not
only as dead in the infirmity of his flesh, but also as ryzen again
through his divine and heavenly power, Romans 1. a. 4
as is said of him in another Text. And therefore when there is any speaking
of the death of our Lord Jesus Christ, it stands us on hand too consider
what the same imports: that is too wit, that it is a sacryfice to make an
atonement of Reco^ciliation between God and man, an obedience too cover all
the naughtiness that is in us, and a washing too scour away all our
uncleanness and filthiness. For as much then as we know that there is such
power in the death and passion of the son of God, and that thereupon we
march further, that is to wit, too the glory wherevntoo it leads us: let us
not any more imagine, that man ought hereafter to continue still in his own
nature, but that he ought too live in the faith of the Gospel, assuring
himself that he shall not be disappoynted in resting upon the promises that
are contained there. Thus ye see in effect whereunto we should refer this
saying, where Saint Paul tells us expressly, that the Son of God gave
himself. And he contenteth not himself too say, that Christ gave himself
for the world in common, for that had bin but a slender saying: but [sheweth
that] every of us must apply too himself particularly, the virtue of the
death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. Whereas it is said that the
Son of God was crucified, we must not only think that the same was done for
the Redemption of the world: but also every of us must on his own behalf
join himself too our Lord Jesus Christ, and conclude, It is for me that he
has suffered. Likewise when we be baptized, as it is not for any one man
alone, so is not the water sprinkled upon all men in common: but every man
is baptized severally in his own behalf, too the end that every of us may
apply it particularly too himself, too say that we be all members of our
Lord Jesus Christ. Also when we receive the holy Supper, every man takes his
own portion, too show us that our Lord Jesus Christ is communicated unto
us, yea even to every one of us. S. Paul therefore does purposely use that
manner of speech, too the end we should not have any cold imagination, after
the manner of diverse ignorant persons, which take themselves too be
Christians, and yet in the mean while are as wretched beasts. But when we
once know that the thing which was done for the redemption of the whole
world, perteyneth to every of us severally: it behooves every of us to say
also on his own behalf, The son of God has loved me so deerly, that he
has given himself to death for me. Furthermore the word Love is not
superfluous here: for Saint Paul's intent is too magnify the gracious
goodness of our Lord Jesus Christ: as if he should say, that we be very
wretches if we accept not such a benefit when it is offered us, seeing that
God in sending us his son, had none other respect but to our miseries which
he intended too relieve. Also our Lord Jesus Christ did so neglect himself,
that he spared not his life for our welfare. And what was the cause of it? The
love that he bare us. Seeing it is so: must we not needs be worse than out of
our wits, if we accept not such a benefit? John. 3. b. 16
But it is a very common doctrine in the holy Scripture, that God so loved the
world, that he spared not his only son, but gave him too death for us: and
also that our Lord Jesus Christ, at such time as we were his deadly enemies
as says Saint Paul, Romans 5. a. 8
did confirm a marvelous love toward us, in that he offered himself in
sacrifice to make atonement between God and us, and too do away all our
sins, so as they might no more come to account. Lo here a warrant of our
salvation, so as we ought to think our selves thoroughly assured of it.
Howbeit S. Paul meant purposely here, too rebuke men's unthankfulness, in that
they accept not the benefit which God grants them so bountifully, yea and
of his own free goodness. 1. John. 4. d. 19.
For it behooves us too call to mind, how Saint John in his Canonical
Epistle says, that we loved not God first: (as if should say, we did not
prevent him, as those think they do which say, I have done him such service
and such. For alas what is it that we can do too him?) but that he loved us,
[yea euen] at such time as we were his deadly enemies,) and came even then to
seek us out in the very deepest of the bottomless Dungeons. And therevppon
Saint Paul adds, that he does not dispize or shake off the grace of God.
This is the knitting up of the things that we have hythertoo seen. For
here he meant too show, that the Devil must needs possess those that make
none accounte of Gods mercy, that is uttered in our Lord Jesus Christ, and
daily offered us in his Gospel. For look how often the death and passion of
our Lord Jesus Christ is preached unto us, and the infinite goodness of our
God talked of: so often is this message renewed unto us, that our Lord Jesus
Christ calls us unto him, to the end we should forsake the world and being
out of all hope in our selves, fasten and settle our whole trust in him. Since
it is so: it is good reason that we should not reject the grace of God. And S.
Paul in saying so, meant to call back such as had gone astray before, and too
show them the way, as if he had said, whereas the poor ignorant souls that
never heard word of the Gospel might be excuzed: we must needs be worse than
damnable, seeing we refuze the grace of God when it is offered us: for it
smells of such an unthankfulness, as can by no means be excused. Saint
Paul therefore does here make mention of those whom our Lord Jesus Christ
calls too the hope of salvation by his Gospel, and yet do still welter in
their own wretchedness, and become brutishe, not knowing whither there be a
better life or no^ or else of such as are sufficiently tormented with inward
heartbyting, and yet seek no remedy nor comfort. Yet notwithstanding, all
they too whom our Lord Jesus Christ has not preached his Gospel, shall not
fail to perish without mercy, They cannot defend themselves by ignorance: I
say that all the heathen folk and Idolaters that ever were, must have their
mouths stopped. And what shall become of us then, which have had our ears
beaten daily with the message that God sends us: which is that he requires
nothing but that we should be drawn unto him, whereunto he incourageth, yea
and beseeches us, as we have seen in the second to the Corinthians? 2 Cor. 5.
d. 20.
It is not a great shame for us, that God should so far abace himself in the
person of his only son, that he should beseech us? Let us fall to
atonement, says he. And what has he done on his side? What has he
offended us? Nay contrariwise, we cease not to provoke him daily against us,
and yet he comes too say unto us, I will fall too atonement with you,
whereas notwithstanding there is nothing but spitefulness in us, we be like
little feends, and to be short, we be damned and forlorn, and yet comes he
to seek unto us, and desires nothing but too have the atonement made. After
that manner speaks Saint Paul word for word. But now what will become of
us, if we reject such grace, seeing that God offers it, us so freely? This is
it which is meant by that saying. And therevppon he concludes in the end,
that if we seek righteousness in the Law, Jesus Christ dyed in vain. As if
he should say, that if we iutende to enjoy the grace that is contained in
the Gospel, we must utterly give over the fond opinion of our own merits.
For men are deceived by bearing themselves in hand, that there is ever somewhat
of value in them: and to be short, they cannot find in their hearts to come
as poor beggars before God, but will always bring some present with them. And
yet notwithstanding all that ever we think our selves too have, is but
abomination. Therefore Saint Paul shows us, that there is none other means
for us too receive life at our Lord Jesus Christ's hand, and too be made
partakers of his death and resurrection, and so to attain too the heritage of
heaven by his means, than to be utterly voyded of all the foolish
ouerweenings, which the children of this world conceive, when they imagine with
themselves, o as for me, I have some virtue in me, I have some towardness:
and to lay it all down and cast it quite away. For until we have forgotten
our own deserts, surely we shall never be able to conceive the grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ. Do we then come unto him? Let us come utterly empty. For
if we make any countenance of having aught, it is nothing else but wind.
Truly whenever men are puffed up with pride: they become so full that they
are ready too burst, howbeeit all of it is but wind. But yet how so ever we
fare, that wind holds us back from receiving the benefits that are
purchaced and brought unto us by the Son of God, and which he communicates
to us by his Gospel. Thus ye see whereunto the conclusion tends which Saint
Paul makes here. Now the Papists will grant well enough that we be not
able to purchase salvation, except we be helped by our Lord Jesus Christ:
howbeeit they imagine that men may half save themselves, and that look what
wants is supplied by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, etc so they suppose
themselves to have a good and auailable startinghole. But in saying so, they
show themselves deadly enemies of the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
vpholders of the case and quarrel of the false Apostles and deceyuers that had
corrupted, defloured, and falsfied the pure truth in the Church of Galatia. For
those sort of men could well enough confess that Jesus Christ was the Savor
of the world, and they would have bin ashamed too say that Jesus Christ was
nothing, nay rather they professed Christianity. And what deemed they of Jesus
Christ? That he came too help men's infirmities, because they were not able to
discharge the law too the full, and that for as much as they could not have so
great and large perfection as was requisite, therefore it behooved them too be
helped by Jesus Christ: and even as much do the Papists say at this day. But
S. Paul concludes on the contrary part, that then Jesus Christ had died in
vain. If any man reply, no not so: for there should come some fruit of his
death and passion, by helping us too the forgiveness of our sins: and
although we have means to satisfy God withal, yet would not the same
suffyze, unless Jesus Christ should work therewith. I say if any man make
such reply: let us mark that S. Paul hild this for a certain and
vndeceyuable principle, that do the best we can, there is nothing but
cursednesse in us, till God have received us of his mere grace. Lo wherein the
Papists beguile themselves, and not they only: for it has bin a common error
among the Turks and among all the Heathen men that ever were. The Turks can
confess well enough that they have need of Gods mercy, and that has always
bin an opinion through the whole world: but they have intermingled their own
satisfactions with Gods grace, as if they should say, although God be pitiful
toward us, yet must we procure favor in his sight by our own deseruings.
After that manner were the Heathen folk wont too speak. And what say the
Papists now adays? All one thing. For after they have once granted
themselves too be wretched sinners, and to have need to be succored by our
Lord Jesus Christ, and that his death and passion are auayleable to make them
way unto God: they interlace their own freewill, and their preparations, and
thereunto say that they deserve on their side, and that although Jesus Christ
help them, yet he does not all himself. And in very deed that is the flat
doctrine of the Papists word for word. For they say we cannot deserve aught
except Jesus Christ go before us and show us the way, for they say that he
has purchaced us the first grace, and that it lies in us to follow on and
too attain to the second. And if a man ask them what is meant by that first
grace they say it is the occasion of meriting or deserving: for that is their
terming of it, and their manner of speech. And this occasion of meriting is
nothing else with them, but that men are able of themselves too bind God too
them by their own satisfactions. But S. Paul tells us that it is to
outrageous, yea and too Devilish a trayterousnesse too have such pride: and
therefore he concludes that Jesus Christ should have died in vain, if we
should seek righteousness in the law. Will we then possess our Lord Jesus
Christ? It behooves us too know wherefore we come unto him: namely because
that by the Law we are already condemned, cursed of God, cut off from hope of
life, and full of all corruption, so as God must be feign too clenze us by his
holy spirit, and for as much as there are many infirmities in us, we must
always come to our Lord Jesus Christ, and to confess that there is nothing
in us but all cursednesse and misery: we must needs come too this conclusion
of S. Paul's, that Christ had died in vain, if it behooved us to obtain
righteousness by the law, whither it were wholly or partly. We must needs
confess that, and the veriest idiotes are able to perceive it, in so much that
if we receive not Jesus Christ with that condition, it is certain that his
coming shall profit us nothing at all. It will be but as a wind to blow us
away together, so as we shall be no more able to take hold of Gods mercy that
is offered us in Jesus Christ. Now seeing it is so: let us learn to leave such
manner of mingling, and acknowledge our selves beholden too our Lord Jesus
Christ for all things: for when we go about too interlace our own merits
with the free remission of our sins, it is but a falsifying of Gods truth.
Besides this, when we have learned to rest our selves after that manner upon
him: let us be taken in love with the spiritual benefits which he brings
us, and let not the afflictions and adversities of this world hinder us from
holding on our course, and from the over coming of all temptations and
distresses, but that we may have full joy in the mids of all our sorrows and
troubles, assuring our selves that all that ever we can suffer in this world,
is nothing in comparison of that which is prepared for us in the kingdom of
heaven. And that is the thing whereunto S. Paul leads us. For first of all he
exhorts us to a holy and well ruled life, and to be lowly as becomes us, to
give our selves wholly to our Lord Jesus Christ. And secondly he exhorts us
to arm our selves with patience, that we may overcome all the assaults and
distresses that come upon us, and walk in such wise in this world, as we may
always go foreward to the heavenly heritage, which we see not, and which
passes all our understanding, not ceassing for all that to assure our selves
of it, since we have so good a promis of it made unto us. And further seeing we
have the earnestpe^nie and pledge of it given unto us in our Lord Jesus Christ:
let the same serve us for a full assurance, to show us that we need not run
at randon, but have a perfect faith and a firm and substantial hope, for
as much as we have already in the person of the Son of God, a full
performance of all things that we can wish.

But now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our sins, praying him to make us feel them more and more,
and to touch us in such wise with true repentance, as the same may provoke us
more and more to seek forgiveness and mercy at Gods hand, and therewithal
also to beseech him to govern us so by his holy spirit, as we may be incoraged
more and more to forsake all the lusts of our own flesh, and all that is of
our old Adam, till we be come to the perfection whereunto he allureth us, and
from which we be so far off as yet. That it may please him to grant this
grace not only to us, but also to all people etc.

The. 15. Sermon, which is the first upon the third Chapter.
O Ye vnwize Galathians, who has bewitched you that ye should not obey the
truth, unto whom Jesus Christ has heretofore bin pottrayed out before your
eyes, and crucified among you?

2 I would know but this one thing of you, received you the spirit by the
works of the Law, or by the preaching of faith?

3 Are ye so vnvvize, that when ye have begone in the spirit, ye will now
end in the flesh?


We see how God goes about to win us by gentleness and fair means, till
our naughtiness and stubbornness enforce him to deal roughly with us,
because we suffer not our selves too be handled so ge^tly by his hand. For
throughout the whole doctrine of the Gospel, God does as it were stretch out
his arms to bring us in unto him and to receive us in his fatherly love: or
rather (as he likeneth himself by Moses) he is as a Hen that spreads out her
wings too gather her young chicke^s under them. Exodus 19. a. 4.
Ye see then that God of his infinite goodness allureth us to him, Deuteronomy. 32.
b. 11.
but we be like wild beasts, that will not suffer themselves to be guyded by
him. And therefore in respect of such our frowardness, he had need to use
roughness, and to show us our unthankfulness, too the end we may learn to
be ashamed of it. And that is the cause why S. Paul having showed that all our
welfare lies in Jesus Christ, and that if we will be partakers of his
righteousness and of the benefits that he is willing too impart unto us, we
must utterly renounce ourselves, and acknowledge that there is nothing but
sin and corruption in us: does now sharply rebuke such as would mingle their
own devotions with the grace that is offered them in our Lord Jesus Christ:
for they had bin instructed faithfully before. If S. Paul had begone in some
place where men had never heard one word of the Gospel before, he would not
have used such roughness: for he would have pitied the blind and ignorant
wretches. But for as much as the Galathians had bin taught faithfully by him,
and he had taken pains to treine them too the Gospel accordingly, and they
therevppon had shrunk back and suffered themselves too be turmoyled with
false opinions: therefore is he so rough with them, according also as he
himself shows, that the reason thereof was, for that Jesus Christ had bin
crucified among them, and that they having seen the treasures of Gods infinite
goodness laid forth after that manner before them, had none excuze to return
again to their pelting trash, in hope to be justified and too purchase
salvation by the Ceremonies of the Law. Thus ye see in effect that the thing
which we have to gather upon this text, is that if we desire too find a
pleasant taste in Gods word, Chap. 3.
we on our side must be teachable and not stubborn. For we must call too
mind how it is written in the eighttenth Psalm, that God will always deal
meeldly with such as be of a meeld spirit, Ps. 18. d. 26
and that he will be rough and sharp toward such as use stubbornness, and
cannot abide to submit themselves unto him. Al they then which have a neck of
brass, and cannot find in their hearts too stoop under the obedience of
God, shall find themselves to be matched with too strong an adversary, and
that they must needs be broozed and broken in pieces if they will not bow.
Furthermore let us mark that when God corrects our vices, we must not
chafe and storm as many do, who do nothing else but gnash their teeth when
they be rebuked, saying that they will not be handled after such a fashion,
and that their nature requires to be taught by gentleness: yea verily, but
that their sturdinesse shows the clean contrary. For they that speak after
that manner, would very feign be flattered. And although they ouershoote
themselves into all evil, yet will they not abide too have their galled backs
rubbed, but rather that men should wink at them and conceal their
naughtiness. But if their faults be laid before them, by and by they rancle
against the Gospel: and whereas they showed some good sign of zeal before,
they utter such spitefulness afterward, as a man may perceive there was
nothing but venim and bitterness in their heart, and it is a sure token that
such folk never wist what it is too profit in Gods school, at leastwize
purely, as S. Paul says in another place. 2. Tim. 3. d. 16.
Gods word (says he) is good, not only to teach, to the end we may know what
is for our behoof, and be able to discern betwixt good and evil: but also
to rebuke and correct us. For there are many negligent folk, which have need
to be pricked foreward with hard strokes of the spur: some had need to be
imbaced by reason of their ouerweening: and othersome grow altogether past^
recovery, if they be not ouermaystred by strong hand. Thus ye see how all of
us must suffer patie^tly when our Lord uses such roughness, acknowledging the
same to be greatly to our behoof. Howbeit let every of us examine his life
well, and there is none of us but he shall find that he provoke God too use
such sharpness toward him, as if a father be as kind hearted as is
possible to be wished, yet if he have unruly children, so as they be ^eude and
froward, he shall be provoked after such a fashion, that he shall as it were
change his nature, because he knows not at what end too begin with them, and
is feign after a sort too transform himself. Even so is it with us. For we
have a father which in goodness surmounteth all that can be seen among men:
but we on our side (as I said before) in steed of yielding obediently unto him
as we ought to do, and in steed of offering our selves redily to walk as he
commands so soon as he does but speak the word: do nothing but stray. We
have our lusts always inordinate and boiling, we have our replies always
ready coined: and although our mouth speak not, yet it appears that there
is no such calmnesse in our hearts, as too be contented to submit our selves to
God as we ought to do. Seeing then that we be convicted to our faces by
experience, that God had need to be so rough and sharp toward us: let us
suffer him to do whatsoever he knows too be for our welfare. And no doubt but
the Galathians were as nyce as we, and had as itching ears as we have: and
yet were they feign too be rebuked so sharply by reason of their
unthankfulness. As for S. Paul, we know he indeuered by all humility and
meeldnesse, too draw all such to the obedience of our Lord Jesus Christ, as
were committed and appointed too his Apostleship. He likeneth himself (and not
without cause) too a nurce, which will bear with her nurse child, and not
spare any thing too show the love that she bears it. We shall see
hereafter that he will say, Hereafter. 4. b. 12.
Be ye as I am, for I am as you be. I seek nothing but too fashion my self
unto you, and to bring to pass that we may agree in one. And yet
notwithstanding, necessity has constreyned him too cry out as you hear now,
Ye vnwize, ye fools, ye indiscreet or witless as beasts, who has
bewitched you after that sort? must you not needs be possessed with the
Devil? Here are very hard words, and no doubt but the Galathians were
grieved at them at the first sight. Yet nevertheless it was meet for them to
feel, that S. Paul used not that manner of speech and language without cause.
Therefore whenever we be rebuked, let us blame our own faults for it, and
yield our selves guilty: for we shall gain nothing by checking again. When
we have disputed what we can, we may peradventure justify our case before men:
but we shall always be guilty before God. Moreover it behooves us too mark
well the reason that is added here by S. Paul, when he says, ye must
needs be bewitched, if ye obey not the truth, seeing that our Lord Jesus
Christ has bin as it were peynted out lively before you, yea and even
crucified among you. In speaking after that fashion, S. Paul shows with what
force and effectualnesse he had preached the Gospel. Therefore he likneth the
doctrine which he had brought, unto a picture: and thereunto inlargeth it yet
better, saying that the matter which he had preached among the Galathians,
ought too avail as much as if they had seen the Son of God crucified among
them, and his blood sheaded out for the spiritual washing of their souls. For
so much then as they had bin taught so faithfully, they could no more excuse
themselves of their backesliding. But first of all we see here which is the
true manner of preaching the Gospel: namely to give knowledge of Gods love
toward us, in that he spared not his only Son, but gave him too the death
for us: according as in very deed all the treasures of wisdom and
understanding are laid up in our Lord Jesus Christ, Coloss. 2. b. 9.
as it is said in another place too the Colossians. Since it is so, if we be
desirous to profit well in the Gospel, let us learn too acknowledge the
grace that is purchaced for us by our Lord Jesus Christ: for without that,
all that we have is nothing. Many will brag that they be well learned in Gods
word: but the true trial too know whither it be so or no, is if we perceive
how great need we have, that God should pour out his mercy upon us, too
succor us by drawing us out of the gulf of Hell, and thereupon conclude that
we cannot be clenzed and washed from any of all our spots, but by the blood
of Gods son nor obtain righteousness but by the obedience that he has
yielded: nor have any satisfaction for us but by the sacrifize that he has
offered: nor come in Gods favor but by his means: nor open our mouths too
call upon him but by his intercession. Therefore when we be thoroughly
persuaded of the gracious benefits that are brought us by the son of God:
then may we say we have some understanding in the Gospel: but without that,
we have nothing but imagination and folly. Mark that for one point. And
therewith let us mark, that it is not enough for us too know slightly that our
Lord Jesus Christ has bought us so dearly: but that we must continue still in
the doctrine of the Gospel, till it be thoroughly printed in our hearts, as
though his blood gushed down, too apply the fruit that comes of it too our
use: and that is too the end to waken us out of our drowsinesse. For we shall
see many that take themselves too be very great Clerks, if they understand
but three or four words of the Gospel at a glaunce. And yet the same shall
soon be defaced and put out of rememberance, because that whereas we ought
too seek too be filled with the benefits that our Lord Jesus Christ has
brought us, they hold themselves contented with a taste of them. God then
punishes the unthankfulness of such folk, and their despizing of his
goodness. And therefore it stands us so much the more on hand, to put forth
and apply all our indeuer to be well settled in the foresaid doctrine, that is
too wit, of knowing whereunto the death and passion of Gods son, and the
inestimable benefits which we have received, do avail us. Again on the other
side we be warned, that our sins are the heynouser before God, if after we
have bin taught his will, we turn head back again, and sin, not through
ignorance, but through contempt and wilfulness. For if we shake off his yoke,
it is a sure proof that we be loath to be subject to him, and play the wild
beasts. True it is that even the ignorantest folk in the world are reproved by
their own sinfulness, for as much as hypocrisy reigns in all men: but yet if
comparison be made between those that never heard one word of the truth, and
us that have our ears beaten with it, and are provoked without end or ceassing
to come unto God: we be much more faulty than they. Behold, the Turks
believe that they woorship the God that made heaven and earth: how beit for
as much as they refuze our Lord Jesus Christ, they have but an Idol. The
Papists also are deceived in their fond devotions. And yet for all that, they
be not a whit the less guilty before God. But what for that? If we that
know the way of salvation, which hear Gods voice ringing continually in our
ears, which are enlightened with the sun of righteousness, Mala^h. 4. a. 2.
even with our Lord Jesus Christ, If we (I say) become as good as brute
beasts, and discern not between good and evil: must it not needs be that
we are (as ye would say) bewitched? For seeing that God is so gracious unto us,
as too come to us and to teach us so familiarly: surely he has just cause to
complain of us as he also does: My people (says he by his Prophet Micheas)
what can I do more for thee than I have done? Micheas. 6. a. 3.
Then if God plead against us, and charge us with all the means which he
has given us to make us wholly his, that he might enjoy us without gaynsaying:
and we on our side cast a stop in his way, and are loath to bow down our
necks to receive his yoke, or else be fickleminded and fleeting too forsake
all again too day or too morrow, and had lever too be beguyled by the crafts
and illusions of Satan, than to be guyded by the truth which is certain: must
it not needs be that we are as monsters, that is to say folk, that make utter
defiance too nature? Therefore let us learn to look better upon our selves
here: for look what was once said too the Galathians, is spoken still at this
day unto us. For it was not for that peoples sake alone that S. Paul wrate:
but the holy Ghost quickens us up still now, and tells us that if we have
once received the doctrine of the Gospel, and afterward start away from it, so
as if a man trace us he shall find no constancy nor stedinesse of faith in us:
we be so much the more damnable, and cannot sheeld our selves with any thing:
for when we shall have taken all the couerts in the world, we shall abide
convicted of such lewdness, as in the end we must needs have our mouths
stopped, and God must set us forth as an example of all unthankfulness, in
so much that we shall become odious both too men and Angels, Math. 13. c. 19.
because we made no better account of the doctrine of salvation, which is so
precious a seed as we see that the Scripture speaks of it. Ye see then
that the thing which we have too bear in mind, is not that the only
Galathians are rebuked here by S. Paul, but that we be taught in their
persons, to walk in fear and awe when God shall have bin so gracious too us,
as too call us unto him, and too show us what his will is. And it is not for
naught that he uses so sharp and rigorous words, as too call them fools and
witless, and consequently too say, who has bewitched you? But we hear how
that in the fourth too the Ephesians, Ephesians. 4. c. 14
concerning the using of the Gospel, he says that when we have once bin
taught it, we must not be as little babes that are led too and fro, and made to
believe that the Crow is white: but we must be so settled in it, that although
the Devil stir up never so many troubles, false opinions and lies, yet we
may still hold our own, and keep on our pace, assuring ourselves that Gods
truth is infallible. Thus ye see that the end whereto the Gospel ought to
serve us, is not only to show us what is good for us, but also to arm and
fence us against all incounters, and against all Satan's slights, so that if
there rise up any heresies or other corruptions, we may still maintain the
battle valiantly, and get the upper hand by our faith, and not be pyped any
more into the fowlers snare, according to the similitude which S. Paul uses.
Now then seeing it is so: it must needs be that we be bewitched and possessed
with the Devil, if such a remedy suffice us not, after that God has
manifested himself unto us, and we know (yea even fully and assuredly) that
it is he which speaks. If we be not moved by his authority, what will become
of it? Again, whereas we have our Lord Jesus Christ shyning upon us as it were
at high none days: must it not needs be that we are at defyance with nature as
I said before, if we seek here and there for by ways, when the right way is
laid before our eyes? So then it is not without cause that Saint Paul
speaks so roughly too that people, which had changed the doctrine, after
that God had granted them the grace to have his truth showed unto them. But we
must call to mind also, how God vpbraideth his people of old time by his
Prophet Jeremy. Iere. 2. c. 10.
Go your ways over the sea (says he) and into the Isles, and into far
countries, and ye shall see every nation worship his own Idols without
changing. And wherefore then are you so variable? As for those, they know not
whereupon they be grounded. They have but a certain opinion, which carries
them away and beguileth them: and yet notwithstanding they hold on still
without turning aside, and stick wholly to it: and why then should you which
know what God ye obey, be so fleeting? Now therefore let us mark well, that if
we be lightly turned and thrust aside from the doctrine of the Gospel: there
shall need none other witness against us at the last day, than the wretched
unbelievers which follow their own superstitions: for we see they be wedded to
them. Look upon the Turks and Painims, look upon the Jews and Papists. They
wot not what God they worship, they have but a weening in sted of faith: and
yet not withstanding a man cannot pluck them from their false fancies, and
they be so given unto them as a man can never remove the^. Then if we on our
side knowing that it is the living God which calls and teaches us daily, and
that the thing which is uttered by men comes of him and of his holy spirit,
and having record of the law and the Gospel which cannot fail, if we (I say)
having such a resting stock for our faith, be afterward unconstant, so as our
ears itch to receive every new toy, and men make us to alter our mind in less
than the turning of a hand, what else betokens it, but that we wilfully
refuse Gods grace, as if we would shet the gate against him that he might not
com in unto us? Or else, if after we have once known, that he offers us so
in estimable a benefit in his Gospel, we cast it down and trample it under
our feet: think we that God will suffer his grace too be so lightly esteemed
and hild skorne of? No. For we cannot despise the doctrine of the Gospel, but
we must vnhalow the blood of Gods son, which he did shead for our redemption:
for the one cannot be separated from the other. Whensoever and how often
soever God speaks to us, and offers us forgiveness of our sins, showing
himself ready to receive us to mercy: so often is the blood of our Lord
Jesus Christ sprinkled upon us. All the teaching in the world cannot do us any
good, except our Lord Jesus Christ be with it, to apply the sheading of his
blood unto us. And if we despise the doctrine of the Gospel, it is all one as
if we did spit at the holy blood of Gods son, which thing is an
intolerable trayterousnesse. Therefore let us look narowlier to our selves, and
wey well this text, to the intent we stand steadfast: and for as much as God has
called us to so great a good turn, and we do now know that is not by haphazard
that the Gospel has bin preached, but because it was Gods will to utter the
infinite riches of his goodness toward us: let us stand in it, and so stick
too it, as nothing may thrust us from it, nor by any means ever shake us down.
Lo in effect what we have to bear away in this text. Moreover we be warned
also, which are the true pictures or peintings to lead us too God. The Papists
say we must have rememberances to teach us, and that images are the books of
the unlearned which are not apt to conceive higher doctrine: but has Saint
Paul spoken here but to three or four folk? No: It is generally, and to all
Christians without exception, as well to great as small, that he says that
when the Gospel is preached, then Jesus Christ is peinted out lively, and we
must look upon him, not with the fleshly eyes of our bodies, but with the
spiritual eyes of our faith. Then seeing it is so, let us learn that we have
no need of Images and puppets to teach us what is necessary for our
salvation, another need we a piece of wood, stone or other such pelting
stuff, too put us in rememberance of God, (for in all those things there is
nothing but vanity and leasing:) but we have need to have Gods word preached,
and to indeuer and travel to make the same familiar too us, that we may there
behold God in his lively image, that is to say in the person of our Lord
Jesus Christ his only son, 2. Cor. 4. a. 3.
according also as Saint Paul says in the second too the Corinthians, where
he protests that the doctrine which he brought unto them, was not hidden
from any but the unbelievers, such as perish, whom the Devil possesses,
and which have their eyes sealed up. And no wonder though they see not awhit in
the open light. But yet in the mean while the doctrine is so manifest unto
us, as we may easly perceive Gods will. For he shows us it familiarly enough
as often as the Gospel is preached, in so much that we need not to make much
running up and down, Deute. 30. c. 12.
not too fetch far wyndlasses: we need no more to say, who shall stie up
above the Clouds? who shall go beyond sea? who shall go down intoo the deep?
Have we Gods word? at leastwise have we it preached purely? Then is Jesus
Christ as it it were in the mids of us, and shows himself as it were
hanging upon the Cross, witnessing what he did for us, when he suffered
death to reconcyle us to God his father. There he sets us down a sure and
vndeceyuable pledge or warrant, and let us content our selves with it. For when
we have pleaded never so much, it will not excuse us: our case will always
go against us, if we be not well assured in our consciences, that we have
whollye leaned unto Gods word, which (as I said) brings us so near unto
God, that it is the very union itself, which we have with him in the person
of our Lord Jesus Christ. And in good sooth, we see how God does as it were
stoup to our rudeness and infirmity. For does he speak in so lofty and dark
a style as we can understand nothing? No: but contrariwise he abaceth himself,
and thereto thinks it not enough to have spoken, but also adds Sacraments to
his word, which are the true pictures that we ought to have. Like as when we
see the water of baptim, it is a picture which shows us that we be ^ull of
filth and uncleanness, till we be washed: and by whom? We must seek our
washing from above. Besides this, it shows us that we must be renewed by the
holy Ghost of God. That then is a good picture. And why? Because it bears
Gods mark, and is matched with his word. As much is to be said of the
Lords supper. When we see the morsells of bread and the drops of wine. Very
well, they be the Creatures whereof we have bin wont too take nurrishmeute
and sustenaunce for our bodies: but the same do lead us to the life of our
souls, and give us to understand, that we have no life but in our Lord Jesus
Christ. And the cause why the wine is added, is to show that he has such
virtue in him, as we need not to seek any part of the things that we want,
any otherwhere: but that he serves us for meat and drink and all. These (I
say) are the good images that God has set before us: and now if we be still
soring in the air, and gadding after our own lusts, to say I would feign have
more: it is a disdeyning of the grace that is offered us. So much the more
therefore does it stand us on hand to mark well this streine, where Saint
Paul by the poewr and in the name of God condemns, yea and with the power of
the holy Ghost thundereth, against all such as have bin taught the Gospel
faithfully, and afterward do turn aside and slip away from it. And thereupon
he adds, that he would feign have it known by what mean the holy Ghost is
received. For if they had received the holy Ghost by the works of the law:
Saint Paul would have granted that there was some righteousness to be had
by it. But forasmuch as they had received him by the Gospel: it must needs be
concluded, that they ought to have rested upon the record that God gave them
so apparently. And for the better understanding of the thing that he meant too
say here: let us mark that Gods spirit is given in common to all the
faithful, for so much as they be regenerated and made new creatures. Besides
this* there are spiritual gifts, which God destributeth according to such
measure and portion as he thinks good, but yet they redound all to the
common welfare of the Church. If we be Christians, we must needs have Gods
spirit, as we shall see hereafter. 2. Cor. 1. d. 22.
For he is called the earnestpenny, and the Seal of the heritage that is
promised us, Ephesians. 1. c. 14
and which we look for. Ye see then that Gods spirit must dwell in us, if
we be his children. But besides this, there are also gracious gifts: as for
example there was in old time the gift of Tungs, the gift of prophesying, the
gift of healing, and such other like. And even still at this day, God shows
well that he has not utterly forsaken his Church. For although visible gifts
reygne not now as they did then: yet notwithstanding we may see still, that God
does by some mean or other utter his operation among us. Furthermore Saint
Paul speaks here to all men. And therefore (according to the common and
ordinary meening of it) we will take this word Spirit, for the renewme^t which
God works in his children, John. 3. a. 6.
as it is said in the third Chapter of Saint John. For in as much as we be
borne of flesh, there is nothing in us but utter corruption, and we tend always
toward the earth. No doubt but men glory in their own wisdom, and moreover
think that they have a free choice and will of their own, to take the good
and [leaue] the evil, but those are but dreams. For it is certain that so
long as we be let alone in our own nature, we tend evermore unto evil,
and the scripture also condemns us of it, Genesis 6. a. 5.
saying that there is not any thought conceived in man's mind, Romans 8. b. 7
but the same is leawd, and all our affections are enemies and rebels against
God. Therefore let us not beguile ourselves any more with vain flatteries, but
acknowledge ourselves too be utterly marred in Adam, so as there is nothing but
sinfulness in us. Notwithstanding, God provides for that mischief, when he
touches us too the quick by his holy spirit, and so purges our hearts as we
desire to obey him, and although we be not so perfect as were requisite, yet
we fight against ourselves, and go forward still to goodness. And surely when
Gods spirit is as a bridle to us to hold us back in his obedience, it is a
sure token that God dwells in us, and governs us as his flock, and holds
us for his children. For we cannot be counted Christians, without this record,
that God warranteth himself to be our father, and that his holy spirit is as
a seal thereof, according as I have already alleged the record of Saint
Paul, Ephesians. 1. 14.
out of the first to the Ephesians. And now he says, that the Galathians had
received the spirit of God by the preaching of the Gospel. Then seeing it is
so, it was for too be concluded, that the works of the law could not iustifye
them. And why? For we must always come back to this principle which we have
treated of, namely that in the Gospel we be utterly stripped out of all the
goodness and virtue which we thought ourselves to have, and that God does us
such shame, as we be feign to come to him as quite confounded. For although God
set our cursednesse before us in the law: yet we perceive it not so well there,
as in the Gospel. And we see how the hipocrites do always flatter themselves,
and think too perform the things that are commanded them. But in the
Gospel there are two things. For God shows that there is nothing in us but
poverty, so as we must be feign to come to beg his grace, with utter
acknowledgement of our bacenesse, how that we have done amiss, and have not
one spark of virtue in us worthy of commendation. Now then, seeing it is so,
Saint Paul does not without cause tell us here, that such as receive Gods
spirit by the preaching of the Gospel, must be void of all trust in their own
merits, and acknowledge themselves beholden all wholly to Gods mere and free
mercy for their whole salvation. And why so? For they be things that can no
more match together than fire and water, that we should be justified by the
Gospel, and also justified by the law. What then? Is the Gospel contrary to
the law? No: for (as I have declared already) God is author as well of the one
as of the other, and there is no contrariworking in him, but the question here
concerns the case of our salvation. God has given men his law too show
them the way too live well, and thereby intended to bring them to such
condemnation, as if he should prefer an indictment against them, and put a
halter about their necks: For truly in the law we see nothing but* Hell gaping
open upon us, that Gods vengeance is ready before hand to encounter us, and
that he is armed against us as our enemy. Those are the things which the law
sets before us. But now is the Gospel given us for a remedy, to the end that
when we be so in despair, we should flee to the grace that is offered us in
our Lord Jesus Christ, and understand that there is none other way [to do us
good] than the forgiveness of our sins, whereby God does so put away and
wype out our offenses, as they come no more to account before him. The thing
then wherein our righteousness consists, is that he burdeneth us not any
more with the evil that is in us. And although we see Gods intent and
determination to be such, both in the law and in the Gospel: yet are we sure
that there is no contrariety in it. Besides this also, if we be not justified
by the Gospel, how can we attain salvation by the law? It is true that the
law is a preparatiue too bring us to the Gospel: for so long as men be
puffed up with pride, Gods grace has no entrance intoo them. If a vessel be
full of wind, let a man labor to put what liquor he will into it, and he
shall not get it in, because the wind beats it back, and hinders the
putting of it in. And we may perceive it even in man's body: for we must be
feign too take similitudes of worldly things too lead us to higher things. If
a man be hungry, and yet notwithstanding have his stomach so puffed up as it
cannot abide any thing: he may well be full: but what for that? All is but
wind, he has never the more nurrishment within for all that, but rather the
wind hinders the entering in of any, good sustenance to nurrish and maintain
him. Even so is it with the foolish presumpteousnesse that is in us. We bear
ourselves in hand, that we be well furnished with all things that we have
need of: howbeit, that is but wind howsoever we fare, and that wynd shetteth
out Gods grace from entering in. But by the Gospel our Lord brings us low,
and shows us our wretchedness. And therefore it behooves us to come to it with
a consideration that our Lord Jesus Christ is set forth unto us there, to the
end that we seeing that there is not one drop of goodness in us, should seek
it in him, yea even al wholly and not by pieces. Thus then ye see why S. Paul
reasons, that for as much as we have received Gods spirit by means of the
Gospel, it behooves us to hold us thereunto, and not go to the Ceremonies of
the law, nor to any other thing one or other, but be contented with that
perfection, seeing it is given us and we may enjoy it without geinsaying. For
although this matter was written to the Galathians: yet is it common to us also
at this day, as well as to them. Let us mark (I say) how our Lord Jesus
Christ wrought in us. And first of all let us practice that which is showed us
in the second to the Corinthians: 2. Cor. 3. d. 18.
which is, that it behooves us to be wholly new fashioned again, and to have
Gods spirit dwelling in us. So then the true mark whereby we may discern
whither we be Gods children or no, is Gods spirit. But bring we that spirit
with us from our mothers womb? Alas no. Another comes it any whit the more by
our own deseruings, as I have told you already: but because it pleases God of
his graciouse goodness to give us it, thereby to draw us to him. If we have
any desire or willingness to walk in the fear of our God, or if we would
feign be able to call upon him with a pure conscience: it is a token that Gods
spirit dwells in us. We need not to seek any other witness, nor to make
any longer scanning of the matter. But now, have we gotten and obtained this
spirit by our own merits? No surely. Then must we needs conclude, that
seeing we have it of gift, it was given us by means of the Gospel. For in
the Gospel God utters his mighty power and working too the salvation of
men, as it is said in the first too the Romans. Romans 1. b. 16
Now if the Gospel be the instrumente whereby we receive Gods spirit,
shall we go seek other means? Were not that a renouncing of the power which
is apparently known too us? It is all one as if we would wilfully leave the
way that is showed us of our God, too seek bywayes after our own fancy. And
if the Galathians were without excuce for their turning away from the Gospel
too the law: what shall we be in these days, if we will needs be wrapped
in the superstitions that men have forged in their own shoppes? As for
example, the Papists think too be justified, not by the Ceremonies that God
had commanded in old time, but by the dotages and gewgawes that they them
selves have devised. For as for the thing which they do now a days term
Gods service, what else is it than a certain hotchpotche, whereinto every man
has cast his own piece and collop? Seeing then that the ca^e stands so, it
is not a despising of God, and a withdrawing of our selves from him, by
rejecting of his grace, too the end he should not have any access at all
unto us, when we will needs mingle men's inventions with the pureness of the
Gospel? Must we not needs be worse than mad in so doing? Then let us know at
one word, that we can not be Christians, but the holy Ghost must hold us
in such humility, as to make us confess, that al our welfare comes of Gods
mere grace, and so cleave to our Lord Jesus Christ, as we not only take him
for a piece or portion of our trust, but be fully satisfied with him as having
drawn of his fullness, assuring our selves that he is the full perfection, not
only of all wisdom, but also of all righteousness and happiness, and that
in him lies and consists all our welfare, which welfare we possess when
we have the Gospel and the preaching of faith, and when we be cast down in
our selves, and utterly bereft of all presumpteousnesse, which keeps us back
from coming unto God. Furthermore let us be so ravished, seeing that our Lord
Jesus Christ has so bountifully given us all that was requisite for our
salvation, I say let us be so ravished with it, as all things else that can be
laid before us, may be but as smoke too us, and we utterly despise and abhor
them, too show how well we have profited in the Gospel, and therewithal be
so constant and steadfast in our selves, as never to be thrust out of the way,
whatsoever the devil whisper in our care. And moreover, for as much as we
be so weak, gross and heavy, that although God do daily provoke every of
us to come unto him, we come but as it were halting and creeping: let us
enforce our selves more and more to beseech God too strengthen us with his holy
spirit, and too make us profit more and more in the knowledge of his Gospel.
And let us not do as those do which imagine them selves too be come to full
perfection at the first day* but let us labor to go forward more and more in
the hope of the heavenly life, and to gather such strength as our faith may
grow from day to day, till we come to the blessed stop, Ephesians. 4. c. 15
whereof S. Paul speaks in the fourth to the Ephesians: which i^, that we
cleave fully to our Lord Jesus Christ.

Now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us so to feel them more
and more, as the same may cause us both too mislike them, and also too ask
forgiveness of them at his hand, that by that means he may be glorified by
us, and we so confirmed by his holy spirit, as we may not doubt but that he
dwells in us, and that as he has once adopted us for his children, so he
will hold us still for the same. And so let us all say, Almighty God
heavenly father. etc.

The.xvj. Sermon which is the second upon the third Chapter.
3 Are ye so unwise, that when ye have begone by the spirit, now ye
end in the flesh?

4 Have ye suffered so much in vain? At leastvvise if it be in vain.

5 He therefore that gives you the spirit, and works mightily in you: does
he it by the works of the law, or by the preaching of the faith?


We know that all the doctrine of the Gospel tends to draw us out of this
world, and to make us come unto God. But that is impossible, unless we be
lifted up continually more and more. Therefore if we intend too profit in
Gods school, we must so labor to correct the infirmities that are in our
nature, as if we were always at the point too be taken out of the world.
True it is that God of his goodness stoopeth down unto us, but that is not
too hold us here beneath: Likewise when he sends us mortal men too be as
his messangers, and exhorts us to come unto him by such means as are fittest
for us, and thereto gives us his Sacraments, which are earthly and visible
signs: therein we see how he voutsafeth right well (as ye would say) too
make him self low, too the end we should not have any excuse, to say we
were not able to mount up to such a height. But how soever the case stand,
if we look well upon the Gospel, we shall find that the mark whereat it
ameth, is to bereeue us of our selves, and of all that belongs too our flesh,
to the end we should come unto him. But on the contrary side, men abuse the
favor that God shows them in setting such visible signs before them, by
bearing them selves in hand, that the whole perfection of their holiness is
to be found there, and that that is the thing whereunto they must hold them.
And the same is not a vice of two days or yesterdays breeding: but it has
reigned from the beginning of the world, and continues yet still, and (which
worse is) men think it not enough to overthrow the thing that God had set up
to draw them unto him: but they do also forge and frame many hindrances to
keep themselves aloof from him. This would be dark if it were not declared
by example. God had in his law ordained Sacrifices, shadows, and figures for
a time: yet did he it not for any pleasure that he had in those bare things:
but by reason of the rudeness of the people (who were as then like little
children) whom he meant to train still forward too a spiritual service, by
means agreeable too their rawnesse. That is the cause why the Ceremonies of
the Law are said to be as it were fleshly. For why? God intended too teach
his people grossly too come thither as they ought to do. But how soever they
fared, the pattern that was showed unto Moses in the mount was heavenly. Then
were there two things in all the Ceremonies of the Law. For when men washed
them selves at their entering into the Temple, when they offered the Sacrifices,
when they used lights and perfumes, and when the Priest clothed him self with
his special apparel: all those things (as in respect of the outward show)
might well be called fleshly and temporal: but (as in respect of their end)
they were spiritual. But what did the Jews? They gazed upon the figures,
without considering wherefore God had ordained them, and bare them selves in
hand, that they had very well discharged their duty, in coming to Church,
and in doing the things that were commanded them outwardly. But truly they
disguised God after their own fancy, as he himself mocketh them for it by
his Prophets, Esa. 66. a. 1
saying that he dwells not in houses made with men's hands, and that the very
heaven is not able too comprehend his majesty, which is infinite. Furthermore
the Papists at this day, thinking it not enough to abuse the things that are
contained in Gods law, have so put too piece after piece, as there is none end
at al of their folly: and yet notwithstanding they entitle them to be the
service of God. But whatsoever they say, they be nothing else than ingling
tricks and masking toys. But now let us come to that which is spoken here.
S. Paul compares the spirit with the flesh. What means he by the
spirit? All the doctrine which God sets forth too us in his Gospel. For
there is a spiritual guyding, so as we be no more hilde under the old
shadows as the Jews were. Ye see then that God in these days reuealeth him
self fully unto us, and having beaten down and disanulled all the shadows of
the Law, shows us that he will have us to come right forth unto him, and
not have any thing remain to hold us back here beneath any more. Under the
law only the Priest preaced near unto God, and all the people kept them
selves a far off. But we have our Lord Jesus Christ, who is our Priest, by
whom the way is opened us in his blood, to make us to come unto God his
father, as the Apostle speaks of him in the Epistle to the Hebrews. Heb. 9.
c. 11
Then if we receive the Gospel as it becomes us, God will deal with us
after such sort, as if we were meet to come near unto him, and will leave
all the things which he had ordained in old time for such as were more rude
and gross. Thus ye see why S. Paul vpbraydeth the Galathians with their
beginning in the spirit, that is too say, for that they had had the doctrine
of the Gospel, which had showed them the things that had bin hidden from the
Jews, or at leastwise had bin showed them but aloof under dark shadows.
Thereupon he vpbraydeth them, that they intended too end in the flesh, that
is too say, with these lower things. And it is all one as if he had said, God
has been so gracious too you, as to have taught you his will out of hand,
and you will needs be hilde still in your Apsie, and in your first principles.
He has given you a high and perfect knowledge, whereby ye have perceived
the inestimable love which he bears you in our Lord Jesus Christ: and will
you now return again too your Apsie, and forget the things that have bin
taught you? Were not that a perverting of all order, and a putting away of the
grace that he had offered you? But we know that naturally when men intend to
learn any thing they begin at the smallest points, and afterward in all
crafts and all trades, proceed by little and little through experience. For if
a man should teach a child high sciences, without teaching him first his
Apsie, and to write and read, and afterward his grammar to guide him forth
by degrees: what a thing were it? Again, when a child is well forward, and
come to man's age, if he should be set back again too his Apsie after he
has well profited: it would be a plain mockery. In like wise is it with
handicraftes. For it is well known, that he which comes newly into a shop,
shall not be of skill too understand as much at the first day, as he shall be
at the end of a year or twain: but first he must be taught his principles,
and afterward grow more and more in cunning. But if that he which has
learned his craft, do at the four years end turn back ageine too that
which he ought too have known the first day: in so dooyng he shall show
himself to be a beast, and that he has lost his time. But now let us apply
this lesson too our selves. Truly for as much as we be heavy and earthy,
we had need to have the things chawed unto us, which we be not able too
digest: yet notwithstanding God is so gracious and charie too us, as too teach
us spiritually: that is too say, after a higher and excellenter manner than he
taught the fathers under the Law. We see that Abraham had not this
privilege; and yet nevertheless he is the father of the faithful, and it
behooves us to be fashioned like unto him, as we shall see a while after. We
see that David was an excellent King and Prophet, and yet notwithstanding he
saw not the things which we see now, but only in a shadow. As much is to
be said of all those whom God guided under the ancient figures. And for
that cause our Lord Jesus Christ says, M^th. 13. b 16.
that the eyes are happy which see the things that we see since his showing
of him self to the world, and that the ears are happy which hear the
doctrine of the Gospel as it is preached unto us. Seeing then that God comes
after that sort unto us, and becomes so familiar with us: if we shrink
back, and take Ceremonies and figures in stead of the good doctrine, as
though we might not come at him: is it not a kicking against him as it were in
spite of him? And does not that rebelleousnesse show us to be unwilling that
God should be merciful and bountiful to wards us, as he shows him self to
be? Now then we may easily understand what S. Paul means here. For he
vpbraydeth the Galathians with their going backward like Seacrabbes, in that
whereas they had bin trained in the spiritual doctrine of the Gospel, they
turned back again to the shadows of the Law. Likewise if we in our time,
after we have once acquaynted our selves with such order as is according too
the Gospel, and be inured with such service of God as is ruled by his pure
word, would needs afterward be mingling of fancies with it, and say, it will
be good to do thus and thus yet: it were a turning back again to the flesh,
that is to say, whereas God has advanced us on high, we would draw down:
and that is a manifest fighting against him. Wherefore let us learn to apply
this doctrine to our own profit, and for as much as God has given us his
word purely preached among us, if we once know how he will be honored and
served, let us not swerve from it, neither too the right hand nor to the left,
but let us so profit in the word that is preached faithfully unto us in the
name of God, as it may appear that we desire to make it auaylable. And surely
the further forward that we shall have bin in it, the less excuce shall we
have if we turn back afterward, as we see many do, which wax cold or
else would feign row between two streams, and whereas it were to be looked
for that they should have gone continually forward, and have come nearer and
nearer unto God, they be still musing upon a sort of seely toys. And now a
days they that would shun persecution, find such shifts as these: They
disguise and falsify Gods word by mingling and turmoyling men's inventions
with it. So much the more therefore does it behoue us to take heed to this
doctrine, where S. Paul tells us, that if God have once set us forward, we
must no more return back to our Apsie like little babes. For it is a shame
for us, when we have once profited in the Gospel, or at leastwise have had
leisure long inoughe for too profit, and yet notwithstanding it shall seem
that we never herd one word of it, He. 5. d. 12.
according as the Apostle in the Epistle to the Hebrews vpbraydeth the Jews,
saying: Ye ought all of you too be teachers in respect of the time that you
have bin taught, and yet notwithstanding you be still like young beginners.
Thus ye see the first point that we have to mark upon this text. Now he
adds consequently, Have ye suffered so many things in vain? If at leastwise
it be in vain. Here he wakeneth up the Galathians, by telling them that God
had done them the honor to make them as witnesses of his Gospel, and yet
notwithstanding that afterward they had swarued from it. And this is a thing
well worth the marking. For sometimes God does us so great honor as to serve
his turn by us, so that his word is by our means maynteined before men. Now
if thereupon we swerve aside, and hold not out to the end in such constancy
as appeared to be in us, it is a double shame, and also it is to be taken for
the greater crime, because the occasion of offense is double: and moreover it
is a vilanous unthankfulness if we continue not in the serving of our God,
when he has reached us his hand after that manner. And this is so much the
more too be noted, because we see many men brag and boast them selves too
have wrought wonders, if our Lord Jesus Christ have served his turn by them
in any thing. What say they? have not I done this and that? They will
allege their own abilities: in so much that (if ye believe them) God is
greatly bound unto them. But put the case they had done a hundred fold more
than they speak of: yet are they even therefore so much the more beholden to
God. For it came not of their own good towardness, but of God who governed
them by his holy spirit: and if they ouershoote them selves afterward, their
fault and offense is so much the worse. And why so? Because they ought too
go forward, and they go backwarde. And moreover they cause many mo too
stumble, than they should have done if they had not bin set forth too the
vewe. For when God lifted them up as it were upon the stage, it was too have
them seen a far off. By means whereof they trouble an infinite multitude of
people, and therefore their fault is so much the haynouser. But yet is that
vice too common. For now a days, such as think them selves too have done
any thing for the Gospel, will needs be exempted from all law and rule: in
so much that if a man blame them for doing amiss, what (say they?) ought I
not to be borne withal? For I have done this and that. To be short, men
will dispense with them selves after that manner, and (which is worse) they
advance them selves proudly against God, when he does them the honor too
employ them about his service. But let us mark how S. Paul says here, Have
ye suffered so much in vain? He takes occasion too blame the Galathians so
much the sorer, because they had already suffered for the Gospels sake, and
been persecuted, and endured many troubles both in their goods and in their
persons. How now (says he?) what is to be said of all that you have
suffered? Is it not a record that God had called you too the magnifying of his
name? For in good faith the things that we suffer for the Gospels sake,
ought too serve us for a badge, as if God did set us in some honorable office.
The greatest honor that we can have, is too be witnesses of Gods truth, so
that although we be subject to lying, yet notwithstanding he justifies his
eternal truth which proceeds from him self, eue^ by us which are wretched
creatures, which are but wind, smoke shadows, and less than nothing. Seeing
then that God appoynteth and ordeineth us to be lawful witnesses for the
advancing and in larging of his Gospel by us: has he not just cause to
complain, if we swerve aside from it after we have suffered for it?
Therefore let all such look narrowly to them selves, as have had any good
beginning. And there is not any warning better worthy too be taken heed
unto, than this. For seeing that the least of the Church have enough too bind
them to Godward for his chozing of them from out of the world, and for his
directing of his Gospel unto the^, in so much that he has left the great ones
and such as take highly upon themselves by reason of their great excellency,
and preferred the lesser sort and such as are despized too the worldward, and
shall surely have the harder account to make, if they shrink away afterward:
what shall become of those whom God vouchsafed to have to be his standerd
bearers, and whom he perferred in such wize, as they ought too have bin an
example and looking glass to others? what excuse shall there be for the^, if
they give the slip? And specially if they that have suffered for the name of
Jesus Christ, and for the doctrine of his Gospel, so far forth as to have
bin kept in prison and too have bin tormented, yea and to have bin brought
even unto deaths door, do afterward start aside: is it not an abolishing of
Gods grace so far forth as in them lies? So little then ought any man's
suffering for the Gospel, serve to excuze him or cause him to be borne
withal: that such as have suffered most* ought too bridle themselves shortest,
knowing that the honor which God does them, holds them so much the more
bound unto him, and that it behooves them to be the more watchful and warer,
that they give none occasion of stumbling to any body. For when folk shall
say, how comes this too pass? such a one should have bin a Martyr of God, he
has endured much for the mayntenance of the truth, and now behold he is
become a renegate: it is a putting of the Gospel to shame and reproach, and
what a thing is that? By that means the name of God shall be greatly
misreported. And therefore let us mark well, that if we have for a time served
God, and he has made our labor fruitful, so as the Church has bin profited
and edified by it: we must walk in the greater carfulness, and take good
heed that we play not the shrewd Cow, that gives a good deal of milk, and
when she has done, strikes down the payle and spilles it. For if we do a
hundred times more harm than we did good: what can we allege for our
defense? how can we say that we have suffered for the Gospel? Wherefore if
we purpose that God should allow of our seruis, let us learn to be constant,
firm and fast settled, that we never swerve aside from our calling, but
continue and go foreward in it more and more. Howbeit for as much as this
vpbrayding was very rigorous, S. Paul mitigateth it, saying: If at leastwize
it be in vain. VVherin he gives the Galathians an incling, that he hops
much better of the^, and that although they were start aside for a time, yet it
would not endure long, but that upon warning and exhortation they would return
again into the right way. And in this text we see, that when we be rebuked
by Gods spirit, it is not too make us fumish, nor to drive us too such a
desperateness that we should take the bridle in our teeth and fall too
chafing: but rather too draw us to repentance. God then intends not to make
us so dismayed, as too leave us in the briers: but after he has showed us our
faults, he calls us always home again too him, and calls us to
repentance, and shows us that he is ready too receive and take us too
mercy, as often as we be touched with true lowliness to be sorry for our
sins, and too acknowledge them unfeignedly and freely. Since it is so, let us on
our side be well aduized, that when we be told of the faults that we have
done, we play not the mad Bedlems, nor go about to win any thing by starting
aside or dragging back: but yield our selves guilty, and be so meek and
patient minded, as too suffer our selves too be blamed after as we have
need. And when rebukings shall seem somewhat with the sharpest and pricking
to us: let us always bear in mind, too consider too what end they tend, and
what fruit follows them, and that although God rebuke us thoroughly, yet he is
ready too forget all our faults afterward. Ye see then what we have to
remember: as if S. Paul should say, that although we to the uttermost of our
power have abolished the grace of God: yet not withstanding he on his part is
loath they should perish and would feign make them to prosper. And thereunto he
rebukes us, to the intent we should not continue vnamendable. Therefore
whenever we shall have bin so far ouerseene as to stray from the right way:
yet let us know that our Lord calls us back too him, and gives us a mean
to return again, if our fault be not matched with wilfulness. Now after that
S. Paul has spoken so, he adds again, that God had dealt forth the gifts
of his holy spirit among the Galathians, yea and that by means of the gospel,
in so much that the same ought to have bin enough to hold them to the doctrine
which they had received, without turning aside or wandering away from it.
Whereas he speaks here of Gods spirit, he meeneth not the grace that was
treated of this morning, which is common to all the faithful: but uses an
other kind of reasoning (as we shall see by the sequel:) namely that besides
Gods showing of himself generally too all the Galathians, that he had adopted
them for his children: he had also ordained Prophets among them, and men
indewed, some with the gift of Tunges, some with the gift of healing, and
othersome with such other like. But all this came to them by means of the
Gospel: and therefore their turning back again to the Ceremonies of the law,
was a burying of all the operacions of Gods spirit. I have told you already how
we must bear in mind, that God co^municateth his spirit to all [his]: for
without that, we could not be Christians, because there is nothing but evil in
our nature. God must be feign to reform us and bring us back to himself, so
as we may become as it were new creatures. Ye see then that God does make us
generally all parttakers of his holy spirit, by means whereof we be touched
with the fear of him, enlightened with faith to seek our salvation in Jesus
Christ, and cheered up to resort unto God, to call upon him, and to yield our
selves obediently to his will: and to be short, so ye see that Gods spirit is
common to all the faithful, and to all his children. But yet does he grant us
other special graces besides, as when he gives us men that teach us his word
faithfully, or that govern the commonwealth wisely, or which have other
gifts: for in so doing he gives us certain tokens that he dwells among us,
and thereby also he binds us so much the more unto him. Let us mark the
reason that S. Paul sets down here. He blames the unthankfulness of the
Galathians, for that they considered not how it came unto them by the preaching
of the Gospel. And he says it purposely, because men will always make fair
protestations ynow, that they meene not to reject Gods grace, and yet do show
the clean contrary in their dooyngs. As how? They that are loath too suffer
themselves too be taught, and would drive away all the ministers of Gods word
if they could, and they which through envy and spitefulness, could find in
their hearts to abolish the remembrance of al those whom God has stablished too
maynteyne the welfare of his people, they (say I) do show well enough, that
they would have God too hold himself a far off from them: and that they be
loath to come at him. For he sets before them the means to come too him, and
they voutchsafe not too take it, but do thrust it from them. So then, whereas
S. Paul finds fault with the Galathia^s, it was not for that they protested
openly with full mouth that they would none of Gods spirit, or that they hild
skorne of his gifts: but too show them that they had very ill regarded Gods
uttering of the gifts of his spirit in their Church. What ought we then
too gather upon this Text. That if God give us means too come unto him, we
must take them awoorth, even by fashioning of our selves unto them. For if the
Gospel be preached among us, and we wilfully forget what is told us: it is
all one as if we rejected God, and turned our back upon him, of purpose too
stray away from him. Wherefore if we intend that God should continue his
grace toward us: let us hold us too the means that he has ordained for us:
that is to say, let us suffer our selves to be taught by such as he sends
unto us, let every of us exercyze himself alone also in reading the holy
scripture, let such as have done good in edifying the Church have room and
place among us, and let us not shet the gate against the holy Ghost. This in
effect is the thing that we have to bear in mind. Furthermore for as much as
S. Paul's intent here, is to bring back the faithful to the Gospel: let us
assure our selves that if we swerve never so little from it, we be straight in
the high way to destruction. And so there is none other knitting of God unto
me^, than by means of the Gospel which must go as a chain that cannot be
broken betwixt the^. And Paul does purposely once again call it the preaching
of faith, to show us how great need we have that God should prevent us. For
until such time as he have reached us his hand in our Lord Jesus Christ, and
drawn us out of the gulf of confusion wherein we be by nature, what are
we? Moreover we see how bountiful he shows himself toward us, in that
he gives himself fully to us in the person of his only Son: surely it is
much more than if he gave us heaven and earth, and all the goods that are in
them. For what are all other things in comparison of our Lord Jesus Christ?
Wherefore let us mark, that seeing that God having declared unto us that we
be utterly unfurnished of all goodness, adds that he will not keep back
any thing from us, nor show himself a nigard toward us, if we seek too him
for all things that we want: we must be contented with it, and if we swerve
never so little one way or other, we deserve well to be utterly bereft and
dispossessed, even of that which we have received already. And therevppon S.
Paul brings us back too the example of Abraham, because he is the father of
all the faithful, and moreover because that in his person it pleazed god to
show how we may become rightuous to be saved: for there is none other way to
bring us to the kingdom of heaven than the same that he went. There is but
only one way, and that is set forth too us in the example of Abraham. S.
Paul therefore says that Abraham believed God, and the same was reckened too
him for righteousness: and therefore that if we will be Abraham's children, we
must believe. Here we have too call too rememberance the thing that has bin
declared already heretofore: that is too say, what this word faith or
be^eefe imports. It is not a single believing that there is but one God which
governs the world: but an assuring of our selves that he takes us for his
children, and that we may fully and freely call upon him as our father,
because he accepts us for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake. Then if we be sure
of the favor and fatherly love of our God, and take such warrantize of it by
his promises, that we have our look wholly fastened upon our Lord Jesus
Christ, in whom we find means too come unto God, and too go freely unto
him: that is the very thing which S. Paul meant by that word Faith. And so,
when he says that too be Ahrahams children we must be faithful: it is all
one as if he said, that we cannot be faithful Christians nor members of the
Church, but by faith: that is to say, except we be bereft of all opinion of our
own deseruings, and moreover so beaten down and dismayed in our selves, as we
may not wot where too become, nor seek any other means of salvation, than in
the free goodness which God offers us, when he tells us that we be
fordone and damned in our sins, and yet notwithstanding, that we must not
cease to have full hope and trust of salvation, in Jesus Christ.

Thus ye see what it is for a man to be a Christian: that is too wit, to be
utterly out of heart in himself, in consideration that he brings nothing with
him but sin and cursednesse: and yet upon the feeling of himself to be so
utterly void of all well deserving: to come unto God to be clothed with the
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. For it is not enough for us to be out of heart
in our selves, as we see that Cain was, who being as it were upon the rack
confesses his fault: (howbeit, that was but through despair, and so
consequently there was nothing in him but murmuring and blasphemy against God:
and in like case is it with all reprobates or cast awayes) but we must so
taste of the love of our God, as we may be able to settle our selves upon it,
and be out of all doubt that he will receive us if we come to the Gospel, at
leastwize if we come in such wise as our hope be grounded, not upon our own
selfweening or imaginacion, but upon Gods promis, and for that we cannot be
disapoynted in waiting upon him and in holding our selves assured of his word.
Thus ye see in effect what it is too be faithful: for we must always have an
eye to the disputation that S. Paul undertakes. He strives against such as
pretended too purchase righteousness before God by the works of the Law. If
there were no more but this saying too be of the faith, without considering
what matter S. Paul treats of here: that manner of speech were but dark,
But when we see how S. Paul declares expressly, that all such as go about
too purchase favor at Gods hand by their own deseruinges, are puffed up with
pride, and that their presumptuousnesse shetteth the gate of Paradise against
them, and that God vouchsafes not to hear them, because they defraude him of
his due honor, and would feign as it were deck themselves with his feathers,
and that they be traitors in robbing him of his righteousness: for as much as
S. Paul handles that point: there is now no doubt but he takes all those too
be of the faith, which distrust themselves, and are utterly out of all hope in
themselves, and yet notwithstanding do return unto Jesus Christ, resting,
leanyng, and trusting wholly unto him. Those therefore are the true children of
Abraham. But now let us see how few Christians there are in the world. True it
is that the word Christian runs roundly in every man's mouth: but in the
mean while it is foully defiled, and God must needs disclayme all such as
pretend after that fashion too be his: like as in the Popedom every man
groundeth himself upon his baptism or christendom. And surely in baptism
we have on Gods behalf an infallible pledge of our salvation. But what for
that? they take but the visible sign, and separate it from our Lord Jesus
Christ. And in very deed the Papists know naught at all of that which is told
us here by S. Paul: but (which worse is) they have their freewill, their
merits, and their satisfactions: in steed of Gods seruis, which they thrust
under foot and falsify, they have gewgawes yea and abominations of the
Devils own forging: and therefore they be sufficiently convicted too have no
christianity in them. And for our part, although we have not the Idolatries
and superstitions that reygne among the Papists: yet are we not so grounded in
the Gospel, that every of us can offer himself frankly unto God, and fully
and freely call upon him, quietly suffering him too guide us: but we shall
see many that are but wretched beasts. True it is that they will well enough
protest themselves too hold nothing at all of the Popes abuses and
superstitions: but if a man talk too them of the grounds and principles of
the gospel, they wot not what thing it is. Othersome which ween themselves
too be great Clerks, when it comes too the trial, do show that all was
but a countenance, and that they did but prate like pyes in a Cage. So much the
more therefore does it behoue us too bear well in mind, how Saint Paul
tells us here, that we cannot be Abraham's children nor members of the
Church, except we come thither with belief of the Gospel, so as every of us
renounce his foreconceyued opinions of his own merits, and assure our selves
that we be utterly damned and drowned in despair, and therevppon resort too
the mere grace of God, and too the mercy which he offers us in our Lord
Jesus Christ, so as we fall too dipping of our selves in the blood which he
has shed too clenze us withal, assuring our selves that there all our dettes
are released, and Gods wrath and vengeance so appeazed, as we cannot fail but
too find him favorable. Howbeeit for the better understanding hereof, let
us mark also after what manner Abraham believed God. And it behooves us too
have the definition of this word Faith: for without that, all this doctrine
would be to no purpose. I have told you already that whereas the Papists
strive against us: they know another why nor wherefore they do it, nor whereat
they bend themselves, but rush forth ouerth wart, awry, and at all adventure.
For they never wist what faith meant, and that do they show well enough, I meene
even the greatest doctors of them, for all that they will say is that faith is
to believe in God: and if they believe in God, so do the Devils too. But when
as S. Paul speaks here of faith, he meeneth not that we should have but
only some guess that there is a God which reigns in heaven: but that we must
take him to be our father, assuring our selves thoroughly of it by the promises
which he gives us, and so link our selves too our Lord Jesus Christ, as we
doubt not but that all that ever he has is proper and belonging to us, because
we be members of his body. But when the Papists talk of faith, they say it is
a confuzed thing, and that it serves not to make us good men so as we might
be saved by it. We see then that the Papists go brutishly to work, as folk
utterly dulled by Satan. And it is a just punishment of God upon their pride,
because they cannot find in their hearts too humble themselves, by confessing
themselves to owe all unto God, and that there is nothing in them worthy to
be accepted at his hand, but that they must be feign to receive the mere
grace that is offered them. Thus ye see after what manner we must take the
word Faith. But here is yet one point more which serves greatly too that
purpose: which is, too know after what manner Abraham believed God, and that
shall be the conclusion. If Abraham had believed no more but that there was a
God in heaven: that would not have served too have justified him, for the
Heathenfolke believed as much. Again, if Abraham had believed that God was
judge of the world: that would not have served his turn another. But when as
God says unto him, Genesis 15. a. 1. and 17. a. 7.
I am thy plentiful reward, and I will be thy God and the God of thy seed
after thee, and moreover all nations shall be blissed in thee: by accepting
such promises wherein God acquainted himself with him, and witnessed too him
that he took him for one of his household and as his own child, and became
his father: Abraham was justified by accepting that promis. And why? For as
soon as God offered him his goodness and grace, he believed the word and
received it: and then was he full sure of his salvation. Now may we much
better judge what it is to be justified by faith: namely that it is not a
confused opinion of believing that there is a God, but a holding of him for our
father and Savior, and that because he shows himself to be so by his word,
and also gives us a good pledge and earnest penny of it in our Lord Jesus
Christ, insomuch that there he shows himself to be joined and united with us,
and that although we be wretched creatures and have nothing in us but all
mischief, yet he fails not too take us for his own, and too admit us into
his favor: the reason whereof is, because our Lord Jesus Christ is the mean
betwixt him and us. Therefore when we have that promise, and rest wholly upon
it, and doubt not but that God does and will show himself gracious to us unto
the end, and therewithal call upon him and resort only unto him, giving over
this world, and continuing in the hope of the heavenly life: then be we sure
that we have faith, and are justified: and that was the manner of our father
Abraham's believing: and without that, let us assure our selves there is no
Christianity at all in us. For (as Saint Paul says in the tenth to the
Romaimes) until we know what the Gospel is, To. 10. c. 14
we cannot call God our father. We cannot call upon God (says he) except
we knew him, To. 10. c. 17
and believed in him. And how is it possible for us to know him, till he be
revealed unto us? Therefore faith must needs go before. And whereof comes
faith? Of hearing, says Saint Paul. Then must we be trained in the Go^pell,
or else we can have no faith. And hereby we see yet better, that all that ever
is termed faith in Popery, is but stark dotage. And why so? For there Gods
word is hidden, and the greatest brutishness that can be, is taken for
greatest devotion. When men babble they wot not what, when they gad on
pilgrimage and never come at God, when they busy their heads about fond
Ceremonies and hear not so much as one word of good doctrine: o, that is
great devotion and holiness. But we see how there is no Christianity
without faith, nor faith without teaching of the Gospel: and so consequently
we cannot be Christians, till God have given us the grace to taste of his
goodness and mercy, as it is daily set before us in the Gospel: assuring our
selves that he accepts us in the number of his children, so as we may be
bold too call upon him, and continue therein too the end, at leastwise in
waiting for the full performance of the things which he reuealeth unto us
now by his mouth, that is to say by his word.

But now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God with
acknowledgement of our sins, praying him to make us feel them more and more,
and that the same feeling of them may draw us unto him with true repentance,
so as we may not only ask him forgiveness of them, but also so reform and
change our selves, as we may truly bear the mark of his children, when we
shall appear before his judgment seat, and as our Lord Jesus Christ also
may repair the Image of his father in us, in such wise as he may acknowledge
us for his members. And in the mean while, let us beseech him to bear with
our infirmities, till he have utterly clenzed us of them. That it may please
him too grant this grace not only to us, but also to all people. etc.

The.17. Sermon, which is the third upon the third Chapter.
7 Know ye therefore that they which are of faith are the children of
Abraham.

8 And the Scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith,
shevved glad tidings aforehande unto Abraham, saying. In thee shall all
nations be blessed.

9 Those then which are of faith, are blessed with faithful Abraham.


IF we were such as we would be taken to be, that is to wit, if we were
Christians: we should be well acquainted with this manner of speech of being
justified by faith. But there are very few to be found even among those that
boast themselves too have profited in the Gospel, which know what is meant by
the righteousness whereof the Scripture speaks so much. Howsoever the case
stand, either we must have skill of that article, or else we can never have
any assurance of our salvation, nor resort unto God at our need to call
freely upon him. And that is the cause why S. Paul stands so much upon
that matter. The last Sunday we saw how Abraham was counted righteous
because he had believed God: and I told you that thereby is showed us, that
no man can bring any worthiness of his own, wherewith to win Gods favor,
but that we must be feign to receive it [of his free gift.] For the word
believing, has a respect too the promise, insomuche that Gods free offering of
himself unto Abraham, was the cause that Abraham was counted righteous,
because he accepted the favor that was offered him of free gift, being well
assured that of himself he had nothing but all iniquity and cursednesse. And
therevppon Saint Paul concludes, that such as are of faith are the children
of Abraham. It is certain that Abraham is the father of all the faithful, and
of all Gods children: and therefore it follows, that either we must be
fashioned after his example, or else the gate of life and salvation is shette
against us, and we be quite and clean banished out of Gods kingdom. Here
Saint Paul shows us the way: For we come not of Abraham as concerning the
flesh, neither belong we aught at all unto him: and yet notwithstanding it
behooves us too be of his race: the only way whereof, is to be partners of
the promise that was given unto him, and to receive it as he did, (here ye see
what it is too be of faith) so that when we once know and find by proof
that we cannot deserve any favor at Gods hand, nor be allowed for our own
works and merits, we repoze our whole trust in his goodness, and apply this
promise to our selves, which is that he adopteth us for his children. Thus ye
see Saint Paul's Text made plain enough. Howbeit he adds, that that
[promise] served not for the Jews alone, but rather that all men in general
are comprehended in it. For without that addition, the doctrine that we have
treated of would serve us to no purpose. God choze Abraham and his offspring: So
then, are we shet out from the hope of salvation: for his choozing imports a
forsaking of all those whom he choozeth not: but he has chosen the lineage of
Abraham, and so by that means it seems that all of us are forsaken. But the
promise which Saint Paul rehearses consists of two parts. The one is, that
God would be the protector of Abraham's lynage, and shole it out from the rest
of the world. Genesis 12. a. 3
The other is, that all nations should be blessed in Abraham and in his
seed. Now if God had placed his Church in the only householde of Abraham,
then should we at this day be miserable. But for as much as in the second
part we also are joined in it, and God inlargeth his goodness and mercy
further, which he had appointed too one certain lineage: by that means we
become parttakers of salvation: And that is the thing which Saint Paul
treats of here, [when he tells vs] that the Scripture foreseeing that God
not only justifies the Jews, but also uses the like mercy toward the
Gentiles, which were as good as cut off from the house, says, All Nations
shall be blessed in thee. Then is there no speaking here of some handful of
men, or of some certain people: but without any exception, God opens the
gate to all such as had erst bin quite and clean past hope. And thereupon
also Saint Paul concludes, that they which are of faith shall be blessed with
faithful Abraham As if he should say, when God justified Abraham, he had not
respect neither to Circumcision, nor to any thing that he had wherewith too
win favor after the opinion of men: but received him in another kew, that is
to wit, as a believing man. God therefore contented himself with Abraham's
faith only. And in that respect also it was his will too make him the father
of the whole Church. Seeing then that God made none account of any thing else
in Abraham but of his faith: Ge. 17. a. 4
let us conclude that God does now still receive us to him in likewise, if we
have the like faith that Abraham had, though not in like measure, and that God
takes it in good worth, though we do but follow him aloof. Then belongs not
this blessing to Abraham's fleshly offspring only, but also too those that were
strangers too him, so there be the like substance and fashion of faith in
them. Howebeeit too the end we take profit by this doctrine, let us remember
what I have touched already, that is to wit, what it is too be of faith:
namely that it is a reposing of our selves wholly in Gods mere mercy. But Saint
Paul sets down a comparison of things contrary, and which can no more
agree than fire and water: that is to wit, of being of the law, and of being
of fatyh. Yet follows it not that the law comes not of God: insomuch that
if we reject it, at whom does such contempt point? Is not Gods authority
impeached thereby? But in these words of Law and Faith, S. Paul respects
not simply the doctrine of either of them, but the hope of salvation that men
may conceive of them. For the righteousness of faith has his record of the
law and the Prophets, as Saint Paul says in the third to the Romans. Romans
3. c. 21*
They be not contrary things: but the diversity of them is in this, that such
as misknowe themselves, and are blinded with hypocrisy, think too purchaze
favor in Gods sight by keeping the Law, which thing is impossible. Those
therefore are of the law, which hold of the Law, as though they were able
too earne the heritage of the heavenly life at Gods hand. On the contrary
part, they that are needy, yea or rather utterly empty of themselves,
acknowledging that they have not so much as one drop of grace in them: they
are of faith. For why, they forsake themselves, and seek their righteousness
elsewhere. They come and offer them selves like poor beggars unto God, to the
end he should fill them, whereas they were utterly empty before. Therefore
mark it for a scholepoynt, that by the force of faith we must be quite rid
of all selfe-trust, and of all ouerweening of our own merits, and have our
whole refuge to Gods mere goodness. But truly we cannot come right forth unto
God, without some mean: our Lord Jesus Christ must be feign too make us way
thither: and all this is comprehended under the word faith. For faith is not
an imagination of men's own forging: it is an assuredness which we conceive
of Gods goodness, when he comes to us and utters familiarly the love that
he bears us. Then must the promise go before, or else there shall be no
following of faith. To be short, whosoever has not bin trained in the Gospel,
can have no faith at all. For God must first have told us that he loves us, or
else we cannot rest upon his goodness, nor call upon him as our father. Now
let us see what this promise is. God not only says that he will have pity upon
us, but also tells us that although we be wretched sinners, yet he will not
cease to accept us, because he buryeth all our sins, namely by the means of
our Lord Jesus Christ: for that sacrifize must needs come forth every where,
where any mention is made of the forgiving of sins. Never can there be any
pardon gotten at Gods hand, except there be bloudsheding with it for a
satisfaction. So then the foundation of this promise where God says that he
will be merciful to us, is Christ's sheading of his blood to wash away our
spots, and his offering up of himself for a full amends, to pacify the wrath
of God his father. Thus ye see how that if we be of faith, we have our eyes
fastened upon Jesus Christ, and our rest and quietness is altogether in his
death and passion, which is the only mean too reconcile us unto God. Also let
us mark, that to be blessed, and to be justified, are al one thing,
accordingly as S. Paul declares here. Hardly shall a man find one among
thirty of such as are called Christians, that can skill to define this word
justify. And surely it is a foul shame that we should have our ears daily
beaten with the Gospel, and yet notwithstanding be ignorant of the chief
article of our faith. Then to be justified, is not too have any righteousness
in a man's self, but to be admitted for rightuous at Gods hand though we be
not so. And here ye see why I said that we have a good opening of this
doctrine, in that Saint Paul sets down the word Bless, in stead of the
word Justify, which he had used before, according to the fourth of the
Romans, Romans 4. a. 5.
where he says that the righteousness of faith, is that our sins are
forgiven us. For So Much then as God is favorable and loving to us, and
receives us as his children: therefore it is said that we be justified
before him. And why justified? Because he cannot love sinners, till he have
forgiven their sins, and put them quite away. We know that forasmuch as God
is rightuous, he cannot agree with sin, but must needs always hate it.
Then since the case stands so: if we intend to have his favor, we must needs
be first clenzed of our offenses. For so long as they come to reckening, God
must needs hate us, and curse us. But contrariwize when he wipeth away all our
sins, then receives he us to mercy. And by that means do we begin to be
blessed of him. Are we then blessed, that is to say, be loved of God? Verily
we are therewithal justified also: that is to say, whereas there was nothing
but sin in us, God makes us parteners of the righteousness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and all the obedience that he yielded is conveyed over unto us. As for
example: If I owe a sum of money, and another pay it for me, although I lay
out nothing out of mine own purse, yet am I quitte. I had not wherewith to
pay, but I found one that discharged me. Even so is it with us: who being
destitute of righteousness, have Jesus Christ for our surety, and he has
satisfied God his father for us. By means whereof our sins are quite wyped
out, so as they come not any more to account or remembrance before God, and
therefore we be justified or blessed, that is to say, where as God must
heretofore have hilde us as accursed and damnable, now he holds us for his
children. And herein also we see the fondness of the Papists, who cannot
find in their hearts to be persuaded that we be justified by faith, because
that (too their seeming) faith is not so excellent a virtue as some other are.
For a man shall not be perceived to do much in holding himself too Gods
promises, and in resting upon them. Men will say, very well such a one is a
wretched sinner, and knows that he had need in deed to be succored by
Gods goodness, and that is the cause why he rests thereupon. But the man
whose conversation bears a goodly show, and is magnified every where, shall be
counted the rightuouser. As for example, if a man be liberal and deal freely
of his goods, and also show himself well dispozed in all other parts of his
life, such a one shall be counted more excellent than a believer. 1. Co. 13. d.
13
Besides this, they do also allege S. Paul's saying in another place, how
that Charity is above Faith and Hope. Yea truly: but the question is not here,
whether of them is the greater, higher, or nobler virtue.

When we say we be justified by faith, it is not meant that there is any
worthiness or desert in our faith, as who should say, that God were bound
unto us, and therefore received us for it: but that because God has showed
himself merciful toward us, and promised to be our Savior, we being
first bereft of all trust in our virtues, do come unto him by faith, knowing
well that if he consider us in our selves, he must needs curse and abhor
us. Seeing then that faith brings not any thing on man's behalf, but receives
all things of Gods mere and free goodness: there is no questioning what
worthiness is in us. And so we see that faith not only helps us too the
attainment of our salvation, but also brings us all perfection. Now after
that Saint Paul has said, that all the heathen are blessed in Abraham: he
adds that it is together with the faithful Abraham. As if he should say,
there is none other means to make us find favor in Gods sight, than only
faith. There is no seeking of help else where in that behalf. For that is yet
too gross an error wherewith the Papists are entangled. For although they wot
not what faith means, nor what it is to be justified: yet are they enforced
to say that faith helps to salvation: Howbeit they add, that it is but
partly, and that charity, and al other virtues work together with it, and
that if men purpose to be allowed of God, they must deserve well at his hand,
so that all is naught worth, without obedience and holiness of life. It is
true that faith cannot be separated from the fear of God: but the matter here
is nothing else but too know by what means God acknowledges us for his
children. But if he have respect too our works, woe be to us. Therefore he
must be feign to turn away his countenance from the considering of our
persons, and to receive us alonely in our Lord Jesus Christ, or else (in his
looking upon us) to mark nothing but our miseries, that he may be moved and
provoked to mercy. Ye see then that God has a double respect in justifying
us. The one is that he beholds our miseries: for in as much as he sees us so
plunged in all confusion, he is moved to pity. Again, to the intent he may no
more be an enemy and take part against us which are sinners, he must be feign
to look upon our Lord Jesus Christ, and upon his righteousness, that the
same may do away all our offenses. Now S. Paul says here, that we can not
be blessed but with faithful Abraham. As if he should say that Abraham
though he were never so holy a man, brought nothing of his own with him when
he obtained righteousness before God. Faith (as I have said already) does
utterly bereeue a man of all the worthiness which he supposes himself to
have. Seeing that Abraham had none other help than faith: it follows that he
renounced al his own works, as which in very deed were nothing worth. Then
since it is so, let us learn to leave such mingling, which brings nothing but
corruption before God: and let us be contented that we be allowed at Gods hand
if he find us faithful. If a man poze us, and say, had Abraham's virtues no
favor in Gods sight? It is easy too answer, that Abraham of his own nature
had nothing but all manner of iniquity. He had bin a castaway, if God had not
plucked him out of the dungeon wherein he was sunken, according as he him self
shows in the last chapter of Joshua. Iosu. 22. a. 2
Consider (says he to the Jews) from whence I took your father Abraham. Did
not his fathers serve Idols? Then did I pluck him out of the bottom of hell.
So, Abraham had not aughte whereof to boast. For he could not have done any
good, if God had not prevented him with his grace. But now after that God had
given Abraham so great and excellent virtues, that he is become as a pattern
of all holiness: yet were not those virtues able too justify him, for there
was always some fault too be found in him, either more or less. Let a man
enforce him self as much as in possible too obey God: and yet shall he always
go limping. Now there can not be so little a fault nor so small a blemish in
our works, but the same is inoughe to make them foul and loathsome before God.
Thus all Abraham's virtues, if they had bin examined strayghtly, could not have
brought him ought but damnation. As much is too be said of David, and of all
others. Besides this, when we fall too scanning whether God love us, and
acknowledge us for his children: it must not be thought he does it for two or
three good deeds, but for such a perfect obedience as we fail not in any one
jot. But surely although Abraham had some perfection in part of his life, yet
could he not be justified by it. For he was continually a man, that is to say,
a sinner: and God hild him so at the staves end, too the intent too humble him,
as he does all the rest of the faithful. Then could not Abraham bring aught of
him self, for look what goodness so ever he had, he hild it of God and of
his free goodness. And moreover, the same was yet still insufficient too save
him: for by nature he was utterly lost and damned, as all the rest of Adams
line is. Therefore it stood him in hand, that God should receive him through
pardoning of his sins, and look upon him singly in his faith. But let us
mark also, that Gods justifying of us is by faith, that is to say, by his own
mere and alonely goodness, and that thereupon it behooves us to rest in his
promise, by the virtue whereof he allows and accepts us, yea and our works
also: not in respect that they come of our selves, but for that we do the^ by
the grace of his holy spirit: and therefore does he accept them and allow
them as righteous, yea even so far forth as to reward them as the whole
scripture does plentifully witness. And yet does all this also proceed of
faith. For when we be justified, that is too say, accepted for righteous
before God: then also are our works justified, that is to say, God accepts
them for rightful, although there be not any worthiness in them, nor any
cause at al why he should receive them. Then like as we our selves are
justified by Gods only free goodness, when we receive his promises by faith:
even so be our works justified by the self same mean. After that manner was
Abraham justified in his person: and then likewise were his works also
justified before God. But howsoever the world go, if ye consider the original
cause and welspring of all: ye must needs conclude that nothing else was
made account of but only faith. For had God listed to sift Abraham's life, he
had bin condemned as all other mortal men are. But his intent was to take him
for his own, and nothing persuaded or moved him thereunto but his own mere
mercy. Also, Abraham had his eyes shut against all vain trustes wherewith men
deceive them selves: he knew there was nothing able to bring him to life, save
the only mercy of God: To be short, like as Abraham had no regard but of
Gods mere mercy: so God had no regard but only of Abraham's faith: and by
that means was he justified. So then let us leave all things that men imagine
to bring them selves in favor with God by mingling this and that with faith:
for they are all but falshods and illusions of Satan: and let faith have such
foundation as this: that is too wit, that with all humility we acknowledge our
selves to be then righteous, when God forgiueth us our sins, and that by the
same means our works also are reckned for good and righteous, because God
lists not to sifte them narrowly, but takes them in good worth of his
fatherly goodness. Thus ye see what we have too gather upon that text. Now,
that the blessedness of Abraham belongs unto us, and is meant unto us, it
appears by that which I have touched already, and by that S. Paul
avouches, that all nati^ons should be blessed in Abraham. And now remains
too see the reason that S. Paul adds on the contrary part. For men by their
good wills can never find in their hearts too give over the opinion which they
have of their own righteousness, except they be compelled and enforced too
it. For although we be saped in so many vices as is oughly to behold: yet
the worst and deepest rooted vice in our nature is pride or presumptuousnesse,
which is a selfewilled weening that there is somewhat in us: in so much that
although God tell us that we be right naught, and that there is nothing in us
but lewdness, filthiness, and uncleanness, and that all the virtue which we
dream upon is but vanity and leasing: yet can he not compass to humble us,
til we our selves perceive our own need, and have it proved to our faces. And
therefore it behooves us to mark well the reason which S. Paul adds here to
draw us to the pure faith, and to turn us away from all the vain trustes
which we can have in our own deseruings. All they (says he) that are of the
law are accursed. For it is written, Cursed be he that continues not in all
the things that are written and contained in this book, too do them. When as
S. Paul says that all they which are of the law are cursed: he means that
so long as men rest and muse upon their own works, and think to obtain grace
by that mean before God: they be cursed. For (as I have declared heretofore)
like as he that forsakes him self, and renounceth all that he has of his
own, and groundeth him self upon the only mercy of God, is of faith: so
contrariwyse, he that thinks too bring any service wherewith too bind God
unto him, or imagines to recompense him with his merits, is of the Law. But
saint Paul says that such are cursed. And why? He alleges the saying of
Moses: Cursed be he that perfourmeth not all that is written here. It had
been said before, Deu. 27. d. 26.
Cursed be he that serves strange Gods: Cursed be he that blasphemeth God:
De. 27. c. 15
Cursed be he that breaks the Sabbath day: Cursed be he that is stubborn
against his father and mother: Cursed be he that defiles another man's wife.
After the rehearsing of all these Curses, and after the solemn uttering of
them, it behooved the people too answer Amen, Amen, as if there had passed some
covenant, and that God on his side had made demand, saying: I will have you
too serve me after this manner, yea even without failing in any point, and in
such wise as ye keep touch with me through stitche in all things that I
command you: and the people on their side should answer, Amen, yea Lord we
be contented to be all damned if we serve thee not: and then afterward God
should come and conclude, Cursed be he that performs not all that ever is
contained in this book, that is too say, which misseth in any one point, and
the people should answer again, sobeit. Now seeing that the law curses all
such as perform it not to the full: let us see if there be any one that
does it. It is certain that al men from the greatest too the least are
gyltie. For why? let us consider the sum of the Law, which is that we
should love God with all our heart, with all our mind, with all our power, and
with all our strength, and our neighbor as our self and then let every of us
try his own life, and he shall need none other judge than him self to condemn
him. For although we loved God with an uncorrupted and sound heart unfeignedly:
yet can it not be, but that we must be drawn diversely with many vanities.
Yea put the case that a man were as perfect as an Angel: yet could he not
love God as he ought to do, for it would behoue all our wits to be employed in
the love of him. But now let us mark if we cast not many vain looks when
we open our eyes; or if that when we open our ears, we be not given too
their much fond talk that tends not to the honor of God, or which is not
utterly void of sin if at leastwyse it be not wicked. But how soever the
case stand, we should so dedicate our wits wholly unto God, as that we
should not think upon any thing wherein he should not be glorified. And where
shall one be found that does so? [No where] but (which worse is) besides
that we have our wits far haled and drawn away from the love of God: we
see that they tickle us daily unto naughtiness, and that we do not so soon
stir a hand but it is to put it too many things of no value. As much is to
be said of our feet, of our eyes, and of our ears. Again, what a dungeon is
there in man's heart? what a number of croaked lusts are there, so snarled one
within another, as there is nothing to be found among them but confusion? In
so much that it is upon very good cause that Jeremy cries out: Ier. 17. b. 9
O what a maze is the heart of man, wherein there is neither end nor measure
to be seen, so that although a man should sound and gage him self never so
deep, yet it is not possible that he should attain too the knowledge of the
hundredth part of his naughtiness. There is none but only God that can be
judge of it. So then, let us mark well, that although God have begotten us
again by his holy spirit, and that we strain our selves to the uttermost to
serve and honor him: yet must we needs come far short of the end, and be
still but on our way thitherwarde, yea and go always halting. And moreover
beside our slownesse, we meet with many falls, and many shrewde rushes, we
limpe on the one foot, and stumble on the other, and diverse times we tumble
over and over. Lo what our life is. Therefore by the Law we see we be all of
us accursed, yea even when there is no many fest sin in us. For (as I have
declared already) if there were no more but this, that no man discharges him
self of the full performance of the Law: it were too be concluded thereupon,
that all of us are condemned by the Law, and therefore that it stands us in
hand to seek our righteousness else where, that is to wit, in the mere mercy
of God. Now then we see how S. Paul shows us, that all such as have any
vain trust in their own merits, are rank traitors too God, and make war
against him. For he does as it were dragge them forth by the hear of their
heads, and show them the distress wherein they be, and what a stubbornness is
it if they will not come unto him? Must not the devil needs have dulled them?
We see then that S. Paul's meaning here, was too drive men too seek their
righteousness and salvation in the only grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: for
without that, the other should never befall us, because we always surmize
some value to be in our selves, and that selfestimation or ouerweening does so
blind us, that we can not glorify God in his righteousness by keeping our
own mouths shet till we be convicted, as we see in this text. Furthermore
let us mark, that S. Paul has taken here a principle which the Papists
cannot find in their hearts too agree unto* For among other things, they say,
cursed and banned be he which shall say that God has commanded us more than
we are able to do. They excommunicate and accurse all such as are of opinion,
that the righteousness of the Law ouerreacheth all the ability of man. For
it seems to them, that God ought not too command us any impossibility, and
that either we must have wherewith too perform the Law, or else the Law
should be too no purpose. So do they think, and so do they say: but the
holy Ghost says the flat contrary: for God is not bound to fashion himself
to our ability. It becomes us to regard what we our selves ought to do. Who
is he that dare step up, and say that he ought not to love God with all his
heart? For seeing that we be his, is it not reason that we should be wholly
dedicated unto him? Ye see then that we be indetted unto him of the perfect
love which he requires. Ageine, if we talk of our own strength, it is not
too be said that we be able to discharge our selves of our duty, as in
respect of the love which we owe unto our God. As for example, If a man have
wasted all his goods in riot, and have not aught left wherewith too pay his
creditors, shall that discharge him of his dettes? If any man say, it is not
through our own default: Yes surely is it. For in as much as we be corrupted
in Adam, original sin holds us sufficiently convicted and guilty before
God, so as it is no excuse too say, I am weak or rather utterly untoward, and
I can not so much as think one good thought, 2. Co. 3. a. 5
according as Saint Paul declares. It is true that we can not think so
much as one good thought, and that our hearts are full of sturdinesse and
malice, so that al our affections are enemies unto God. So speaks the
Scripture: but howsoever the world go, we cease not too be still bound too
our duty. Wherefore let us mark, that the Law is commanded us, though it
be impossible for us to fulfill and perform it. Romans 8. a. 3.
And if it were not so, S. Paul would not have said in the eight too the
Romans, that God performed that thing by the means of our Lord Jesus Christ,
which was impossible too the Law. In saying so he shows well that we be
not able to perform all that God commands us. For if we could bring that
to pass, surely we should be justified by it. For it is said that all such
as fulfill the Law shall live therein. Leu. 18. a. 5.
If any man could be found that had performed it, he should live. But S.
Paul takes the same reason afterward too show, that it is a folly to
think to get righteousness by keeping of the Law: for no man can bring it to
pass as is required. Now then as touching this text, let us understand that
S. Paul presupposes that no man is able too perform the Law, though he
strain himself never so much: insomuch that although he be governed by the
holy Ghost, yet shall he never be able to bring it too pass during this
^ightfull life, because God gives us his grace by measure. It is true that he
could give us such perfection as nothing should be amiss in all our life, but
that we should have a full and more than angelical conformity too all his
commandments. Howbeit, although he hold us in awe, although he change us
and fashion us new again, although he reyne us back to the obedience of his
will: yet is there no full perfection in us. And why? For he intends to hold
us still under the bridle of humility, he will have us to know our own
weakness, and to groan for it before him: and he will have us to pass
judgment, and to know that we be always in^etted unto him. Forasmuch then
as God does not in this present life give us such perfection as were requisite
to the full performance of his whole law: therefore we can never do thoroughly the
things that he co^ma^deth us. And forasmuch as we be not able to perform the^
therefore this judgment is hundred down upon our heads, that he is cursed which
fulfilleth not all the things. It behooves us to mark well that saying: for it
is not said, Cursed be he that rejects the Law, or which keeps no point
at all of it: but, Cursed be he that discharges not himself of it point by
point, and through stitche, as I said before. And for that cause also S. James
(too the end too beat down men's pride) says that he which fails in any
one point, Iam. 2. b. 10
is guilty of the whole. We will think this to be very rough dealing at the
first sight. What, say we? will God forget all the good that a man has done,
for the committing of some one only fault? That would be counted cruelty
among men. Yea, but S. James adds a reason, saying: He that forbad to
murder, forbad also to commit whordome: and he that forbad to steal, forbad
all the residue too. Then if I think my self to have satisfied God in
forbearing theft, and in the mean while am a whoremaster: have I not offended
the majesty of God? And therefore we must leave all these peecings: for if we
bring God some one piece, and let all the rest alone, what a dealing will that
be* We see that one man is given to one vice, and another to another, and so
every man would be privileged and dispenst with under color that he had done
this or that, notwithstanding that he missed in some other point. But God has
not separated his commandments asunder. He has not said too one man, thou
shalt not steal, and to another, Thou shalt not commit aduoutry: but he
says to al men without exception, Absteyne ye from whordome; absteyne ye from
theft, absteyne ye from murder. Therefore we must examine our life, not by
any one commandment alone, but by all the whole law together. But now let us
see if we can find any man that is faultlesse. Ye see then that we must
needs be confounded, so long as we stand to be judged by the law. For if
Abraham, who was the excellentest that ever could be picked out among men,
should be driven to enter into account by that: it is certain that he should
not miss too be damned. Seeing it is so, let us bear well in mind that it
is not for us too dispute any more: for when the Papists speak of the
righteousness of faith, they do but dally and skoffe with God, as if he were
a little babe. Let us keep our selves from such scornfulnesse: and when God
pronounces this horrible sentence, that all they be cursed which fulfill not
all that is written, let us conceive such a terror of it, as we may quake
before his majesty, yea and every of us become his own judge, and willingly
yield himself guilty, and being so convicted of our wretchedness bewail our
utter failing in all things, and thereupon embrace the righteousness that is
offered us in our Lord Jesus Christ, taking all our contentment and rest there.

Now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we may not only ask
him forgiveness with true repentance, but also pray him to hold us up all the
time of our life, till he have taken us hence into his own kingdom, and in
the mean while to reform us more and more by his holy spirit, to the end we
may have sure record that we be of the number of his children, by governing
ourselves after that manner in fear, and seek nothing else but to give
ourselves wholly unto him. And so let us all say, Almighty God heavenly father.
etc.

The. 18. Sermon which is the fourth upon the third Chapter.
11. That no man is justified by the law before God, it is manifest: for the
rightuous shall live by faith.

12. And the law is not of says: but the man that does those things, shall
live in them.

13. Christ has raunsomed us from the curse of the law, in that he became
accursed for us, (for it is vvritte^, cursed is he that hangs on tree.)

14. That the blissednesse of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles through
Jesus Christ, to the end that we might receive the promis of the spirit by
faith.


WE have seen that if men be not worse than mad, they must needs (for all
that ever they have) seek their salvation in our Lord Jesus Christ. For if
they stick to the law, they shall find nothing there but damnation, as has
bin showed already: and that does every man find sufficiently by his own
experience. And certesse when as Saint Paul goes about in the Epistle to the
Romans, To. 4. c. 15.
to show that men beguile themselves too grossly by trusting in their own
merits: he faith that the law can work nothing but Gods wrath and vengeance.
For although we be already sufficiently condemned ere God open his mouth to
give sentence against us: yet notwithstanding, our naughtiness is yet deeper
engraven by the law, when he says that if we transgress but some any one
point, we become enemies to God, and his wrath must needs be kindled against
us. What shall we gain by disputing, when the determinate sentence is
pronounced by the heavenly judge? There is another appeal nor pleading that
will stand us in sted. So then, let us understand, that to have the true
knowledge of the Gospel, we must hold us wholly to our Lord Jesus Christ,
that we put not our hope of salvation in any other thing than in his only
mercy: and for the performance thereof, let every of us have an eye to his
own life. For if men sift themselves thoroughly without hypocrisy or feyning,
surely all cause of pleading will soon be rid away. The Papists will not in
any wise grant that only faith should make us acceptable to God, and that is
because they never felt thoroughly what it is to come before Gods judgment
seat, but have always as it were played with the shadow of it. And therefore
no marvel though they pardon themselves in all things. But the very way to
bring us to the truth and to the pure and right religion, is for every of us to
look into his own life, what it is. Now if there were but one myte (as ye
would say) amiss, it is certain that we were forthwith in danger of
eternal death. But surely every of us shall find himself a sinner, not in
some one point alone, but in a hundred thousand: not in some one fault, but in
infinite sorts of faults. And when we shall have perceived never so many
miseries in ourselves, God knows yet many mo without comparison than we can:
for he sees much cleerer than we do, 1. John. 3. d. 20.
as says Saint John in his canonical Epistle. Thus then is our pleading
utterly void. Thus is sentence given that we cannot be justified by the law,
but by faith only.

And now the Apostle going forward with his matter, uses another reason,
which is, that if we seek righteousness in the law, the same will be a
clean contrary one to the righteousness which Gods children and chosen people
obtain by faith. For what manner of one is the righteousness of the law says
he? [This it is.] He that does those things shall live in them: that is to
say, whosoever obeys God and does his commandments, shall have salvation
for his labor. Lo here a fair promis: but what good will it do us? If we
will assay to do the things thoroughly which are commanded us, we shall every
one of us see that God shows us our condemnation so much the greeuouser, as
if he had set it down before us. What would become of our salvation, if we
should seek it in ourselves, and be feign to earne it? Now therefore, when we
here that God is ready to recompense all such as shall have served and
honored him by keeping of his law: it seems to us before we go any further,
that we have gotten a marvelous vantage, Tush (say we:) behold, God byndeth
himself too us, and warranteth us the heritage of heaven if we serve him and
fulfill his will. [Yea:] but when we have compared our life too his doctrine,
we shall find that his showing of himself so liberal and bountiful toward
us, too bind himself to us for our serving of him and for our keeping of his
law, is a plunging of us much deeper into the gulf wherein we were before.
What shall we do then? We must resort to the remedy which the Apostle
sets down here before us by the mouth of Abacucke: which is that the
rightuouse shall live by faith. Therefore let us refuse the promis of the law
because it is not for our behoof, Abacuk. 2. a. 4.
and take the freegiue^ goodness of our god, who reaches out his arms to
receive us, so we be clear rid of al selfweening. That is the thing which is
set down unto us here by S. Paul. And it is a reason that holds of
contraries as they term it. As for example, if a man should say that fire
heateth: and another wilful body should hold the contrary it might be said
unto him, see if ye or frost do heat or no: does it not appear that they be
things diverse, repugnant, and unmatchable? Again, if it should be demanded
whither the heat of the Sun is behooffull for this life or no: what a thing
were it if there were no Sun in the world? we should de all of us be choked
with the filthiness of the air, all the corruption whereof is clenzed away by
the shyning of the Sun. Then like as men may reason upon contraries in the
order of nature: so the Apostle says that we cannot be justified both by
the law, and by the free favor of God: that is too say, if we be well lyked
at Gods hand, our coming into his favor must be through his own freebestowed
goodness, because he loves us in our Lord Jesus Christ, and not for any
worthynesse that can be in our selves. Howbeit, for the better understanding of
this doctrine. Let us mark well how it is told us here, that the
righteousness of the law is the fulfilling of Gods commandments. And
hereby it might seem to us that the doctrine of the law were sufficient to
save us, for as much as God having rehearsed the ten commandments that are
contained in the law, has finally told us that that is the thing whereby we
should live, the thing whereby we should direct our life, the infallible
rule, and that we must not seek any other perfection of righteousness than
that. And that is the very matter wherein we strive so much against the
Papists, because that whereas God requires obedience, they think to do him
as good seruis with the things that are of their own deuizing. Wherefore let
us mark that the full perfection of all holiness is contained in the Law.
Yea verily as in respect of doctrine. For it is not lawful to add any thing
to it, and men do but ouerlabour themselves in vain, when they bring in I wot
not what deuotious of their own deuyzing. But it is not enough for us that the
doctrine of the law does sufficientlye show us what ryghtuousenesse is: we
come too this point also, namely whither we be able to do the things that God
has enjoined us. I told you this morning, that we come far short of that.
And so the promis of the law is nothing to our behoof, and the Papists do
fowlly ouershoote themselves in that behalf. For they hold still this
fantastical opinion, that God has not commanded any thing which we be not
able to perform. But we see the clean contrary by Saint Paul. To confirm
their error, they allege, that then God mocketh men, in telling them that he
which does those things shall live in them. But this knot is easy too be
untied. For if God gave men no remedy, it is certain that they should be
utterly abashed when he says, that he which does these things shall live in
them, that is to say, no man shall live. At the first blush (as I said) we may
seem to have won the goal, seeing that God has told us, that by keeping his
law we shall obtain his favor, and that there is a crown of glory prepared
for us whereof we cannot fail: but when we have cast our cards, we must be
fayn to come to this point, that no man can atteyne to life by his own
purchase or earning: for why, no man performs the law. It is not said, he
that does but some one part or other of the law, shall live: but he that
does all that is contained in it. What manner of thing then is the
rightuousenesse of the law? It is a full and perfect keeping of it, without
missing or failing in any point at al. But such a one is not to be found among
men, and therefore it follows that all of us are disappointed, and shut out
from the promis that is given us in the law. Yet is it not to be said that God
mocketh us, when he holds us at the staves end, because men deceive
themselves through their own pride, by boasting of their own deseruings. He
has good reason to hold them so at the staves end: and if there were no law
nor any such promis, what would come of it? We know that the heathen men would
always needs be in Gods favor for their own virtues sake: and yet in the
mean while they knew there were many faults in them, and for that cause they
retained the use of sacrifising. It is true that they understood not the end of
them: yet nevertheless, their sacrifising was a plain confession that they
were indaungered unto God, and had need to be admitted into his favor.
Likewise the Papists do at this day pack together a great deal of pelting
trash, to make atonement with God. And so ye see that the heathen men did at
all times keep the same trade which the Papists keep at this day. But
howsoever they fared, their intent was to be saved at Gods hand for their own
deseruings. Howbeit God tells us that if we think he owes us any thing of
duty, we deceive ourselves: notwithstanding, he promises of his own free
goodness, that if we keep the law we shall be reckened for rightuous before
him. But now, do we keep it? No, we come far short of it, in so much that if
we consider how much we fail of it, we must needs be abashed at it. Ye see
then how it is not without cause that God has given us that promis, though we
reap no profit nor advantage by it. For it has a respect to the correcting
of the pride wherewith we be so sore infected, that we must be clenzed of it
by some violent remedy, or else we shall burst. And what remedy is that?
Behold, God talks to us thus: Go to, ye murmur at me, if I handle you not
after your own lyking: but I tell you, that I will not only pour out my
graciouse gifts and benefits upon you in this world: but also do lay up an
everlasting heritage in store for you, so ye serve me. Serve me, and make me a
good account, and then shall you be sure that I will recompense you, both in
this life and in the life to come. Gods speaking after that manner is to none
other end, but to stop men's mouths, and to make them acknowledge, that if
God punish them and send them never so many afflictions, it is ryghtly done in
so much that all such as shall have well sifted their own lives, shall be driven
to confess, yea even unfeignedly, Alas, if we be not worthy to eat bread for
the sustenance of this transitory life upon earth, how can we by our own
deserts get the heritage of heaven, which is a glory that belongs only unto
God? How can we atteyne to it by our own strength? Ye see then that men's
combs are quite cut, by Gods giving of this so large and liberal promis unto
them. And therewithal we have too note, that the same promis is free of
itself, and yet fare we never awhit the better for any piece of it, till we
have utterly let go our hold of it. This would be dark if it should not be
laid forth more at large. The heathenmen (as I have said already) did
fully persuade themselves that they should be recompensed at Gods hand, if they
lived after an honest and unblameable fashion among men. But that was great
folly, or rather stark madness. For how can God become indetted unto us,
as it is told us in the seventeenth of Saint Luke? Lu. 17. c. 10
Though men could do better than the Angels of heaven, could they bynd God
too them by it? No: for they be his aforehand by nature: accordingly also as
our Lord Jesus Christ alleges the similitude of a servant, not of such
servants as are now adays, but such slaves or bondmen as were in those days.
If a bondslaue had bin slain a hundred times for his master, yet was it at his
masters will whither he should live or dye still. Therefore our Lord Jesus
Christ makes his allegation in this wise. Go to, ye be but poor mortal
creatures yourselues: and yet if any of you have a bondslaue, he will hold
him as an Ass or an Ox: and when the servant after sore travel and labor
with great pain all the day long, returns home at night, his master will not
make him too sit down at the table with him: for he has done no more than his
duty and that which he was bound to do. Now then, shall God be of less
authority or in worse case than mortal me^? For so much as you are his,
although you indeuer to walk in his obedience, yet can he not be any whit
beholden to you. And so (as I have declared already) whereas God has said in
his law, that he which does these things shall live in them: what moved him to
such bountifulness as to promis us everlasting life? It was not for that he
owed us any thing. Kill we ourselves a hundred thousand times to serve him, yet
cannot that bind him too yield us any recompense. Howbeit, of his own
superabundant goodness he comes and says, Although I owe ye not any thing
at all, nor you be able to bring aught that may deserve any recompense, (for
you be bound unto me in all points and all respects:) yet will I reward you
for your labor. Go to therefore; settle yourselues to your duty, and do the
things that I command you, and you shall not be disapointed of your payment.
Thus ye see in effect what we have too remember, as I must tell you yet once
again hereafter. Now the Papists will welynough grant this in part, but not
commonly. For the most part (I meene of those that are the Popes right
champions) can no skill of those principles at this day. Yet will some of the^
grant, that whereas God has in his law promised the reward of life to such as
serve him: it is to show that works are not of such value as to deserve
everlasting life, but by reason of the promis. But presuppose that God has
bound himself as he has done: and then they think that we deserve: and why?
For else (say they) Gods promising that he which does those things shall live
in them, is in vain. But they like wretched beasts (as I said before,)
consider not that God says it not to show that men are able to purchase
salvation by their own deserts: but rather to hold them convicted, and to
bring them to true humility, which they shun continually through their
foolish ouerweening and vain gloriousness. Now then we see that Paul's meening
is in effect, that if we go about to be justified by the law and by our own
works, we must not leave any thing behynd nor forget any thing: for it is said,
he that does all those things shall live in them. But now where is that man
which is so forward, that he can boast of the full discharging of his duty
toward God? None but hipocrities that are besotted in their own devilish
pride, or heathenish folk that skorne God and never were moved to true
repentance, but have always had their consciences asleep or rather bewitched:
none (say I) but such folks do think themselves to deserve aught, and they
beguyle themselves. Then seeing that the righteousness of the law is shut away
from us, and we be utterly barred from it: it behooves us to go to another
ryghtuousnesse, which is, that God take us into his favor of his own free
goodness, and in sted of receiving any thing of our bringing, give us that
thing for our payment which is none of ours, that is to wit, the obedience of
our Lord Jesus Christ, by delivering us from the condemnation wherein we were
plunged, that is to wit by putting away all our offenses and sins. As much is
said of it in another place, where Saint Paul treats excellently well of the
doctrine which we have here. Romans 3. c. 19
For he does also set down the righteousness of the law. And it is a wonder
that the Papists have bin and yet still are so dulled, that they consider not
the warning that S. Paul gives here, being so fair and clear as it is. For
it is always at their tungs end to say, what? that were a mocking out of all that God has promised, concerning the recompense that he will veld to good
works. And seeing he has so often said that we shall be reco^pensed: must he not
needs discharge his promise? For else men might accuse him of untruth. But
Saint Paul tells them always thus: my friends, if we think to stand in
Gods favor for our own deserts: let us consider the promise that is given
us. For when there is any controversy among men, either for bying or selling
or for any other like thing: they will say here is the Indenture, let it be
looked upon, I report me too that which is contained in it. As soon as the
deed is read, the case appears plain: and the seller will say, the ownership
[of this thing] is thine, but yet upon condition that thou have paid for it.
If thou have not paid, thou have nothing to do with it. Ye see then that when
we fall to scanning for the inheritance of salvation, we must resort to the
chief and original deed or Indenture, that God made between himself and us.
Now, that deed or Indenture is the Law. Therefore if men will needs be paid
their wages according too their service, they shall find themselves rather to
be banished from the everlasting life, than to come any thing near it. God may
say to them that if they perform all that is commanded them, the heritage of
salvation is ready for them. But now remains to be seen whether any man
can perform all or no. I have showed you already that no man is able to do
it: and so are we every one of us shet quite out of the doors. The Papists
consider not that: but when they hear it said that he which does those
things shall live in them: they bear themselves in hand, that that there is no
more doubt of the doing thereof: it is enough that God says the word. In
deed God speaks the word, but he requires the performance of it at our
hands. After the same manner also do they take this text of Saint Paul's where
he says, Romans 2. b. 13
not the hearers of the law, but the doers of it shall be justified. The Papists
allege that saying, howbeit but to pick out their own eyes withal. For S.
Paul pro^eth thereby that we cannot be justified but by performing all that is
commanded us. The Jews boasted that the Law was given unto them, saying:
Tushe, we have the Law whereby it is told us that we be Gods people. Yea,
but it is with condition. And where is [the performance of] that condition?
Will it be found in you? No. But S. Paul says that we become not righteous
by hearing of the Law. For it were a fond matter if we should come to Church
too here what is told us, and every man return home to do what he lists
himself. It behooves us to perform whatsoever God commands us: but none of
us performs it, and therefore all of us are damned, says he. The Papists
consider not this consequence, but take only this saying broken off from the
rest, namely that such as perform the law shall be justified. Yea verily, if
there were any such, but where are they? Romans 8. a. 3.
Also in the same Epistle to the Romans he declares afterward that Gods
promising of us eternal life upon condition that we perform the Law, stands
us in no steed at all, because we shall never bring it to pass, forasmuch as
by nature we be utterly contrary to his righteousness, and afterward when he
has begotten us again by his holy spirit, we be so much the more bound unto
him: we have received all our goodness at his hand: and he shall but crown
his own gifts in us. Are these then merits or deseruings? [No.] Howbeeit we
must pass yet further, namely that although our Lord voutchsafe to crown our
works when they be good, yet they be but partly good, and there will always
be matter enough found to condemn us with. So then we be quite and clean
bereft of all trust in our own righteousness, not only because our works
are not of sufficient worthiness before God: but also because they be to be
utterly mislyked if we should fall to entering into account, and that God
listed to judge according to the said sentence, He that does these things
shall live in them: for it is all one as if he should say, you are all of you
dead, damned and past recovery. For why, none of you performs the things
that I require of him, and yet you owe them to me. And that is the cause why I
said that we must go to the second remedy, that is to wit, to live by faith.
And S. Paul in the text by me even now alleged, in sted of rehercing the
saying of Abacucke which he had set down in the.xvij. verse of the first
chapter, Romans 3. c. 12
says that the righteousness of faith has good record in the Law. For the
righteousness of the Law, that is too say, the rule that God gives us in his
Law too justify us with all, is that we should keep and perform all his
commandments. But the righteousness of faith speaks another manner of
language. For it says that it is not for men too seek in themselves the
means too make their life allowable before God, and so to receive the hyre or
crown of it: but that they must rest wholly upon Gods word, so as it may be
both in their heart and in their mouth. For he that believes with his heart
that our Lord Jesus Christ dyed, To. 10. b. 9.
and confesses with his mouth that he is rizen again, shall by that means
obteyn righteousness before God. We see then that Saint Paul utters
himself the more at large, to the intent that we should understand, that his
separating of the righteousness of the Law from the righteousness of faith,
is too show that they be unmatchable, and can no more be joined together
than fire and water. True it is that there is no contrariety betwixt the Law
and the Gospel, as I have said before: for we know that both twain of them
do come of God. But here it behooves us too take Gods meening in such wise as
he declares it to us: which is, that by setting the righteousness of the Law
before us, he intends to humble us and to make us condemn our selves when we
come before him, which thing we would never do, if he should not bewray our
wretchedness. Therefore when he says that we shall be justified by keeping of
the Law: it is all one as if he should say, wretched wightes, what
worthiness or valor ween you to be in your selves? VVey my commandments,
and consider what they import, and therewithal bethink your selves how every
of you has lived: and ye shall be as good as drowned in despair. When God
has said so, he adds the remedy: Come (says he) to the doctrine of the
Gospel. And what a manner a one is that? Saint Paul alleges here the saying
of Abacucke, Abac. 2. a. 4
how that the rightuous shall live by faith. And in the same place which I have
alleged he opens himself, how that it behooves to resort wholly to our
Lord Jesus Christ. For the word that ought too be in our mouth, and in our
heart, to bring us unto God, and too open us the kingdom of heaven, is not a
word that serves to hold us down here beneath, nor too make men believe
that God will allow of our own deserts, nor too puff us up with pride: no,
but too hold us fast to our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore when we know that
our sins are wyped out by the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ: and
that by his resurrection such righteousness is purchased for us, that in
stead of being damned too the gulf of hell, which is the heritage that
belongs to us, and whereof we be worthy, we be made heirs of the kingdom
of heaven: and when we know that in Jesus Christ we recover all that we had
lost in Adam, and the cursednesse wherein we be wrapped is taken from us, and
God has set us free: that is Gods justifying of us by faith.) And in good
faith, when we have well considered the circumstance of the text that Saint
Paul alleges out of the Prophet Abacucke: we shall see plainly that that
is the thing whereunto the holy Ghost leads us. For the Prophet had spoken
of the chastizements and corrections which God would send upon the people: so
as (to look unto) all should seem too be confounded. Now thereupon he
says, that the wicked shall but swell more and more in their pride, howbeit
that they shall have no sure footing, but shall stu^ble with all their sway, and
because they will needs exalt themselves, they shall the more cast themselves
down, with so much the sorer and fouler fall. That the^ is the thing which the
prophet utters against the wicked. And he adds on the contrary part, but
the rightuous shall live by faith. Now whereas he says that the rightuous shall
live it is all one as if he had said, that gods children shall not find their
life near at hand in themselves, but that even when they shall have traueled
over all the world, up and down, it shall seem to the^ that there is nowhere any
thing else tha^ the very dungeons of death, and yet notwithstanding that
missing of a present life, they shall find a life to come, when they shall have
nurrished it in their hearts and minds by faith. We see the^ that the Prophets
intent is to draw Gods chosen both from the world and from themselves, to the
end they may cleave wholly unto him, and not seek any other means to be saved,
than by his only grace. But S. Paul has spoken more breefly here, because he
was fully resolved of all that I have declared heretofore, and which he
himself has discoursed, that is to wit, That faith teaches us too seek
all our welfare in God. But the Law teaches us the contrary. I say it
teaches us it, to the end too show us that to seek it thoroughly, we must
acknowledge that there is not so much as one drop of life in us. The Law then
says unto us, go to, take ye pains, and do ye so much as ye may win
heaven by it. And why does the Law say so? Not too feed men in their vain
self trust, of weening still that they can deserve well at Gods hand, it is not
for that: but to prepare the^ to receive the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
with lowliness. For (as I have said already) when we keep our selves aloof
from God, and every man bears himself in hand that he is well worthy to be
accepted of him: our Lord will surely be aduenged of such presumptuousnesse,
and says, Go to, let me see what ye have done: come on, and let us fall to
reckening: and let him that owes aught to other pay it. Ye shall not be
disappointed by me: I have your wages in my hand, it is ready for you, and if
ye shall have done all that I have commanded you, fear not but you shall be
well paid for your labor. Therefore hie you apace, and let me see how you will
serve me. But (as I said) our Lord in saying so, prepares and dispozeth us to
know in what plight we be. For when we once perceive our own need, then will
we seek our wantes at his hand. Thus ye see how the Law leads us to faith:
but it is a strange kind of leading. Howsoever the case stand, there is
always this co^trarietie which S. Paul sets down here, namely that we
cannot be justified by faith, except we have first known and acknowledged
unfeignedly, that we be damned in our selves, and that the ground of our welfare
is to know that there is nothing but damnation in us. Now at the first sight it
might be said that S. Paul has stretched this saying of Abacucks too far,
seeing he spoke there but of the afflictions of this transitory life. The
rightuous shall live, that is to say, he shall hold out, and although God
afflict him and scourge him, yet shall he not quayle if he ground himself upon
Gods promises. And here the case concerns not Gods comforting and delivering
of us from the miseries whereunto we be subject in this world: but it
concerns our everlasting salvation, which far passes all the state of this
transitory life. It seems therefore that S. Paul applies not this Text of
the Prophet aright. Howbeeit let us mark, that if the Prophet had looked no
further than too this world, that saying of his had bin very vain, seeing
that afflictions are common both to good and bad. Again, how is it that we
live by faith? Seeing we be continually subject to fall into the same danger
whereoutof God has delivered me once, twice, or thrice before, and that if God
have pitied me in some affliction to day, so as I have felt his favor, he
afflicts me to morrow with some other affliction: what were my life if I
rested upon the world? So then, the Prophet me^t to declare, that although the
faithful be miserable and do but pyne away in this world, yet notwithstanding
they be blessed of God even in this world, and all the misery which they
endure here shall turn to their welfare: for why they rest themselves upon
their God. Wherefore we must understand that there is a better heritage than
this, and that we seek the true and everlasting happiness, so as we may have a
steadfast continuance of our state. But the word Righteousness, ought also to
be well marked. For if Abacucke had said, the wretched sinners shall live by
faith: it would have seemed that he had spoken but to a few folk. For it will
well enough be granted that wretched sinners should flee for refuge unto
God: but as for those that excel in virtue, ought they not to be exempted from
the common array, and to be exalted too a higher degree at Gods hand, and
finally too be justified by prerogative? Accordingly as we see nowadayes that
although there be nothing but al manner of filth in the Popish Ceremonies and
Clergy as they term it, so as they ought to be abhorred both of God and man:
yet notwithstanding, under color of their Coules, and all other their
trumperie, they cease not to challenge God too be greatly in their det. And
besides this, when these dotardes have made much babbling, and trotted and
scudded up and down from altar too altar, and from Chapel to Chapel, and
gadded on pilgrimage: to their seeming, God ought not to forget any of these
doings, but all of it ought to pass for good payment in their account, besides
an hundred thousand other Items which they have too set down before him.
Math. 21. c. 31.
And that is the cause why our Lord Jesus Christ says, that the wretched loce
livers, yea even the very whooremongers shall much sooner come too the
kingdom of heaven, than (...) any of all these foul toades that are so puffed
up with the vain trust of their own deserts, that although their whole life be
wicked, and they themselves are full of all lothsomnesse, yet they will needs
bind God unto the^, under the shadow of their hypocisie. Now to the intent to
cut off all occasion of such imaginations, the Prophet says purposely, that
the rightuous shall live by faith. At the first sight there should seem to be
some contrariety in these two sayings. How so? Must we to the intent to be
rightuous live by faith? [yea:] for if we live not by faith, we be not
rightuous. For what is the righteousness of the Gospel? It is Gods free
giving us a convenient remedy whereby to come unto him, and to be in his favor
through our Lord Jesus Christ, because we cannot obtain righteousness by the
law. Therefore whosoever lives by faith is out of doubt not rightuous of
himself. But the Prophet says, that those notwithstanding are rightuous,
which are saved by Gods only and free mercy. Therefore it is as much as if he
had said, that although God give us the grace to employ our selves to his
service, and have by his holy spirit imprinted in our hearts the true fear and
honor which we owe unto him, so as we fight against the lusts of our flesh to
the uttermost of our power, and strive against the sin that is in us, and in
our nature: yet must we shet our eyes at all the things which we would feign
find in our selves too please God with, and rest wholly upon our Lord Jesus
Christ. If the rightuous must be feign to be justified by faith: who shall be
justified by his own deseruings? None will take upon them, but Devils, wicked
wightes, and enemies of God. Ye see then that the Papists even at this day
could not deuize to show betten that they intend not to be rightuous, than
by their stryuing for the righteousness of their own works and deserts, as
they do. For it is an utter fighting even with a spyte: against God and
nature. You [Papists] say you, seek too be rightuous: and how? even by your
selves, and by your own works and deseruings. Well, let us consider what the
Prophet says: he says not that the rightuous shall live by their works, but
that they shall be saved by the only grace of God. Now if the righteous give
over all self trust of their own merits, as of force they must needs do: it
is certain that such as think to make God indetted unto the^, by bringing any
virtue of their own unto him, do wipe^ and raze themselves quite and clean out
of the register of righteousness. Thus ye see that the Papists, so long as
they dwell in their error, are rejected of God, according to the sentence
which he gives upon them here by his Prophet. And undoubtedly when as Saint
Paul alleges this saying of David, Happy is he to whom God imputes not
his sins: To. 4. a. 6.
he shows well thereby, Psalm 32. a. 1.
that those men are most righteous which do most condemn themselves, and are
most stricken down, yea and are utterly out of all hope of themselves, till God
have succored them by his goodness. Now, when David cried out, happy is the
man to whom God imputes not his sins: he was not a naughtipacke, nor an
unthrift, nor a dispiser of God, that had never tasted what it was too enter
into his own conscience, and too ransacke his sins too the quick: but
contrariwise God had chosen him, and anointed him by Samuel, he was an
excellent Prophet, his reign was a figure of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
finally God wrought so in him, that he was as an Angel dwelling among men. And
yet for all this, he confesses and acknowledges his sins, and in confessing
of the^ does sorrow and mourn, and is in such unquietness as if he were
tormented upon a rack or torture, till God was so gracious to him as to make
him taste of his goodness, and he knew no ease till God had received him to
mercy. Then if God vouchsafe too forbear the examining of our works, that is
all our happiness: the only way for us to become happy, is to have our
sins covered, and too be in Gods favor, howbeeit not in respect of aught
that is in our selves, but by his turning away of his countenance from us
damned wretches, so as he consider us not as of our selves, but accept us for
his only sons sake, accordingly as we see how David speaks of it in
another text, Ps. 143. a. 2.
saying: Lord enter not intoo judgment with thy servant, for I know that no
man living shall be found righteous in thy sight. Wherefore let us mark
well, that according as each man shall have profited in the fear of God, so
also will he be the more abashed at his sins, not for three or four
months, but so as he shall abhor them all his life long, for so much as he
sees that hell is always ready to swallow him up at one chop, if God
supplied not his wantes, and drew him not as it were out of the gulf of
death. And therefore it is said that the righteous shall live by faith, to the
end that the same should serve as a lesson, not for a three or four months
only, nor for those only which are not of so perfect life as other men: but
as a lesson that God speaks, even to such as are the most excellent. And
surely, that also is the thing whereunto we must refer the word Live, so as
we may live not for a little while, nor for a day, nor for two or three
months, but continually in Gods free goodness, and seek the same from day
too day, Coloss. 3. a. 3
even to the end. And although our life be hidden in this world (as S. Paul
says) and we see nothing but death before us: yet let us not cease too
repose our selves upon this promis, that our life is sure for as much as God
has taken it intoo his custody, and will keep it safely, and thereunto has
left us so good a pledge of it, Deuteronomy. 30. c. 12. and Romans 10. a. 6.
that is too wit, our Lord Jesus Christ, who died and is rizen again for us,
and therefore we shall not need too say any more, who shall go up into
heaven, or who shall go down intoo the deep, or who shall pass over the sea?
For the word is in our mouth and in our heart, in as much as we know that our
Lord Jesus Christ went down too hell, that is too say (as we shall see in
the next sermon by Gods leave) that he became accursed for us, which is the
thing that must content us: and afterward went up intoo heaven, whereof the
gate is opened unto us, ever since he entered in thither in our behalf.
Therefore let us take all our hold there, and suffer our selves too be as poor
dead men in this world, waiting for the discovery of the life that is
promised us: for no doubt but God will in due time discover it and manifestly
show it unto us, in such wyze as we shall fully enjoy it as it is preached
too us by his Gospel.

And now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us feel them more and more,
and that we may be so touched with them, as it may beat us flat down before
him, and make us sigh and groan under the burden of our infirmities and vices
wherewith we be he^med in, till he have clenzed us thoroughly of them: and
praying him also too bear with us during this mortal life, till he have fully
delivered us from the bondage of sin, and from the bonds of Satan wherein
we be hild as now, till he have set us utterly free from them. That it may
please him too grant this grace, not only to us, but also to all people etc.

The. 19. Sermon which is the fifth upon the third Chapter.
13 Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law in that he was made
accursed for us: (for it is written, Cursed is every one that ha^geth on tree)

14 To the end that the blissednesse of Abraham should come upon the Gentiles
through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promis of the spirit by faith.


We have seen already, that if we hope not to be saved by some other
means than by discharging our duty, we should all of us be accursed, because
we be all guilty before God [in that we are found] too have transgressed and
done amiss many ways. For there was never yet any of the holiest men so
perfect, but that there was always some blemish, yea and store of infirmities
in him. Therefore it is to be concluded, that if God should call us too
account, we should be all damned and forlorn. Lo in what plight men be,
though they set never so much store by themselves. But now it stands us on
hand, too have some means too escape this cursednesse. Else what shall it
avail us to have our ears beaten daily with Gods word? For his will shall
serve but to plundge us still deeper in eternal death. To the end therefore
that Gods word may be profitable too us and auaylable to our salvation: it
lies us upon to get us out of the said sentence of damnation, which is given
and proclaimed upon all mankind. And Saint Paul shows us here the mean,
namely that Christ has redeemed us, even by becoming accursed for us. He
shows us that our Lord Jesus Christ was not hanged upon tree in vain: for
he was feign too bear the cursednesse of all such as were too be called, too
salvation. Ye see we are all accursed, as I have declared already: and
therefore was our Lord feign too receive in his person, the thing that was
due unto us. Now it was written in the Law of Moses, Cursed shall he be
hangs on tree. Deuteronomy. 21. d. 23.
When our Lord commands the body too be taken down, he adds that it is
a cursed sight too behold a man so disfigured, [and therefore] let it be
taken down, says he. And at such time as God pronounced the said sentence,
that he which should be hanged on tree should be as it were accursed and
banned: he knew well enough what he had determined of his own only Son. For
our Lord Jesus Christ suffered not that kind of death by chance, nor at
man's pleasure or appointment. Act. 2. d. 23 and 4. f. 28.
It is true that the unbelievers crucified him: but that was because God had so
ordained it by his own purpose, according as it is said, John. 3 b. 16
that God so loved the world, that he spared not his only begotten Son, but
delivered him too death for us. And in good sooth, if only Iudassis betraying
of our Lord Jesus Christ had bin the cause of his death, and that he had bin
haled to that kind of death by only violence: it could not be the foundation
of our welfare. It behooves us to note, that God had appointed the matter after
that sort aforehand: Act. 4. d. 23.
according also as Saint Peter treats thereof more fully in the fourth
chapter of the Acts, where he says that our Lord Jesus was so crucified by
the wicked, as they attempted not any thing, but that which had bin determined
aforehand in Gods purpose.

Now then, whereas it is said that our Lord Jesus Christ was crucified, we
must come too this point, that all was done for our salvation, because it was
Gods will too reconcyle us too himself by that mean: and that when he
pronounced this sentence, cursed is he that hangs on tree, so as it was his
pleasure to have it registered in the law of Moses: he was not ignorant what
should happen afterward: for he had already determined and ordained it. Then
must we match these two things toogither: that is too wit, that God with
his own mouth said determinately that who soever hung upon tree should be
accursed: and yet for all that, that it was his will therewithal, that his
own Son should be hanged on tree. And why so? Too the end he should bear
our burden, according as he is our pledge, and ordained to be the principal
detter in our behalf. To the end then that we might be set free from the
curse of the Law, Jesus Christ became accursed. Now at the first fight it
might seem hard and strange that the Lord of glory, he that has all
sovereign dominion, and before whose majesty the very Angels of heaven do
tremble and are abashed, should be subject too cursing. But we must go back
too that which S. Paul has treated of in the first to the Corinthians, 1.
Cor. 1. c. 28. and 23.
namely that the doctrine of the Gospel is foolishness too mankind, yea even
too the wyzest of them: and that it was Gods will too humble us after that
manner, because of our unthankfulness. For we should have a good instruction to
lead us unto God, yea even in wisdom, if we could profit our selves by the
things that are showed us in the whole order of heaven and earth. But for
as much as men are blind and shet their eyes against this wisdom that God
sets before them: therefore he is feign too take a new way to the wood, and
too draw them to him as it were by folly. So then let us not judge after our
own mother wit, of the thing that is declared here, which is, that the son
of God was put under the curse: but rather let us be ravished at such a
secret, and give the glory unto our God, seeing he has so loved our souls,
as too pay so inestimable a price for the raunsoming of them. And so little
ought this thing to imbace the majesty of our Lord Jesus Christ, or to deface
that which is given him in the holy Scripture: as we rather have cause too
glorify him the more for it. Phil. 3. a. 6.
And for proof thereof, our Lord Jesus Christ (as says S. Paul) committed
no robbery when he showed himself in his infinite glory. And yet
notwithstanding he abaced himself willing, and not only clothed himself with
our nature, and became a passible man: but also submitted himself to a death
that was both shameful before men, yea and accursed before God. Then must it
needs be that we were very dear unto him, seeing he yielded himself too such
extremity for our redemption. If we could taste the meening hereof: surely
we would give our selves wholly too the magnifying of that grace, which cannot
be sufficiently expressed by words, and surpasses all wisdom of man. Seeing
therefore that we comprehend it not, nor can utter the hundredth part of it:
let us yet be as it were astonished at it in considering so much of it as we be
able too comprehend. But here we see still the lewdness and frowardness of
men, in that whereas S. Paul says that our Lord Jesus Christ became
accursed for us, it passes and slippeth away from us. Yea and there are some
so lewd, that they take occasion of stumbling and of flinging out of the way,
and of estraunging themselves quite and clean from the Church, when they
hear this manner of our reedeming set before us. What (say they) was it of
necessity that the son of God who is the fountain of all goodness and
ought too make us all holy, should be cursed? It seems too them that God in
so doing meant too pervert all order and reason. But (as I have declared
already) it is certain that God condemns men's unkindness, by bringing them
to such a kind of foolishness, because they came not too him by wisdom when
he showed them that way. Neuerthe later howsoever the case stand, needs must
our wits shrink and our reason be utterly confounded, so as we may honor
Gods secrets and wonder at them though they be hidden from us. And again,
whenever it is said unto us that the son of God became accursed for us: it
would become us to enter into the examinacion of our sins. In so doing we
shall perceive how lothly we be before God, till our sins and offenses be
washed away by the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. Had all the Angels of
heaven undertaken for us, it had bin no sufficient bail. Then was there none
other satisfaction than the person of our Lord Jesus Christ. And he came not
into the world too discharge us of the bond of everlasting death wherein we
were bound, by his divine and heavenly power. How then? By weakness. And not
only so: but also he was feign to be counted accursed, or else we should have
lien still overwhelmed with the burden, and have perished all of us in that
gulf. Therefore when we see that the son of God who not only is the
unspotted Lamb, and the mirror of all righteousness, holiness and
perfection, but also the very welspring thereof, was hilde accursed for us:
ought we not at the sight thereof to conceive such a terror for our sins,
that we should be as good as swallowed up with despair, till we be plucked
back again by the infinite grace and goodness of our God? So then let us
mark well, that when it is told us that we were raunsomed from the curse of
the Law, God intends thereby to bring us to true humility. But that cannot
be, unless men be utterly confounded in themselves, so as they be ashamed too
look upon themselves, and therewithal also afraid and dismayed, knowing that
Gods wrath wayteth ready for them, till our Lord Jesus Christ do remedy the
matter. Thus ye see that all our whole life is loathsome before God, and there
is no way for us too come too atonement with him, till our Lord Jesus Christ
take upon him the cursednesse that is in us, and bear it in his own person.
And therefore as often as we read this text, let every of us awake and set
himself before Gods judgment seat, that we may feel there as it were a
gulf to swallow us up quyte and clean, and thereat be abashed for very shame
of our selves: and [on the other side] so much the more magnify the grace that
is purchaced for us in the person of the son of God, and keep our selves
warely from diminishing his dignity, in that he is said to be accursed: and
rather thereby be the more provoked to yield him his due and deserved praise,
for that he has showed himself to esteem our welfare so highly* Furthermore
let us make our profit of that pledge of our salvation and of the love that God
bears us, so as we doubt not but that God likes well of us when we come to
him, 1. Pet. 1. c. 18
seeing he has bought us so dear, that (as S. Peter tells us in his first
canonical Epistle) it was another gold nor silver nor any corruptible thing,
but it was our Lord Jesus Christ himself that was paid for our ransom.
Therefore let us not doubt but that mercy is ready for us, as often as we seek
it in his name, for if we should come with any opinion of our own deseruings,
what were that worth? But when we know how dearly the Son is beloved of the
father, and how precious his death was: that is the thing wherein we have full
certainty that God will always hear us, and that we shall find him
merciful and favorable toward us, namely if we rest wholly upon that which
is told us here: which is, that our Lord Jesus Christ forbear not even to
become accursed for our sakes. Here withal let us mark how S. Paul says,
that by that means the promis of the spirit came unto the Gentyles, as it had
bin given unto Abraham. Now by naming Abraham here, he shows that the
promis belonged first and formest too those that came of his race. For the
Jews had as it were a peculiar interest in the heritage of salvation, till
such time as God opened the gate too the whole world, and published his
Gospel too the end that all men should be made parttakers of the redemption
that was purchaced by our Lord Jesus Christ. Now then, although the said
promis belonged too the Jews, and was after a sort peculiar too them: yet was
it after them made common too the whole world. And why? For it consists in
spirit, and not in Ceremonies. By this word Spirit Saint Paul meant too
deface all the false opinion of those deceyuers, which mingled the Law and
the Gospel toogither. He shows that all these things, namely the Sacrifices,
Circumcision, and such other things are now superfluous. Not that there is no
profit for us too gather by the Ceremonies in reading the Law: but because
the use of them is abolished. Ye see then that the cause why the promis is at
this day called spiritual, is for that we have no more need of the old
shadows and figures, but are simply called and guyded to our God, so as we
may call upon him with full trust, and being so adopted by him rest wholly
upon our Lord Jesus Christ, as the only foundation of the Gospel, and seek
all our wantes in him. That in effect is the thing that S. Paul meant too say
in this text. And hereupon he uses another reason, too show that we have our
salvation perfectly reveled in the Gospel, and need not any other doctrine
than that, and also that we be justified by the free mercy of our God. For
the Law (says he) was given four hundred and thirty years after the
promis of salvation. Now when any covenant is made, though it be but between
men, yet ought it too be kept, if it be once thoroughly agreed upon.
Therefore it follows, that the Law was not given too disanuall the covenant
that God had made with Abraham, chiefly in the behalf of his lineage, and
finally in the behalf of the whole world. True it is that at the first blush
this argument of Saint Paul's may seem very weak: for we know that second
couenantes do always repeal former couenantes: in so much that although men
have made any bargayne, yet they may aduyze themselves better, and therevppon
change their minds, and so the first bargain shall be as good as buried. As
much is to be said of Laws and Statutes. For a former Law may well be
repealed and disanulled by a second Law. But Saint Paul presupposes the
thing that is too be considered in this matter: which is, that when a man has
once promised, yea and solemnly bound himself: he will not go back again, but
be as good as his word. Howbeit if both the parties agree too change the
thing that they had consented on, and be both of one mind: then may it be so.
But it were no fit similitude too take men that are fickleminded and
chaungeable through lightness, or by better advice: but S. Paul presupposes
a covenant too be made by a man that will stand to it, and not fall too
skanning afterward how to shift it off by any means at all. For if any of the
parties should do against the former covenant, it were a falsehood that were
not to be borne with among men, because the things that are inregistred so
solemnly, ought to be stood too and performed without any gaynsaying. Now then
shall there be less steadfastness in God, than in men which are nothing but
vanity? The Gospel therefore must continue vnimpeached, notwithstanding that
the law came in after the making of the free promis. This would be still
dark if it should not be declared in order. I have showed heretofore what
comparison S. Paul makes between the Law and the Gospel. For whereas God
promises salvation in his Law: it is upon condition that men serve him and
do their duty toward him. But that is not done: and therefore are we shet
out from all hope of salvation as in respect of the Law, not that God is not
faithful on his side, but because we keep not touch with him in performing
that which he requires. It is all one as if a man should say, I am ready to
sell you this thing, so you bring me money. Now if a man bring another money
nor moneys worth, he can not be put in possession of the thing [that he would
haue]: for the condition is that he must first pay for it. So then, God
promises us the heritage of salvation, when we shall have served him: but we
be never the better for it, because it is but upon condition that we perform
that which he requires of us, and we be fraughted with all iniquity, and
have not any thing in us but uncleanness and filth, in somuche that we be
justly odious unto him. And so are we all condemned in the law: howbeit God
receives us of his free goodness in our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom he
offers us the forgiveness of our sins, and will have us so too embrace his
offered goodness, as we should hold our selves wholly to our Lord Jesus
Christ, and utterly renounce ourselves. But now (says Saint Paul) let us see
whither went before other in antiquity: the free promis of salvation, or the
law. We know the diversity that is betwixt them. Then if the law were the
auncienter, it might seem that that ought to be sticked too, because God does
never unsay his words another is variable. But if the free promis were the
elder, and were made before the law was published: it is to be concluded, that
God repented him not, ne called back his promis at that time, ne meant to
disanul the said covenant: for it were too great a diminishing of his bounty
and mercy, if we should say that he had first bound himself of his own free
goodness, and promised men salvation without their desert: and afterward
intended to restreyne it, as though he meant to enrich himself with our good
works. It were an auk thing too talk after that fashion. For Saint Paul
shows that the free promis was given before the law: and therefore it
follows that the law came not in to diminish or alter any whit of it, but
that it continues still in his own fullness, nature, and force. True it is
that our Lord Jesus Christ had not yet showed himself to the world, when the
free promis was made to our father Abraham: nevertheless it suffiseth that he
was ordained to be our mediator, that by his means men might be reconciled to
God. Now if any man allege, that it should seem then that the law was more
than needed, or else that there was some change and variableness in Gods
purpose, seeing the law came in: Saint Paul discusseth the same in place
convenient, and we must not huddle up things together, for all cannot be
uttered at once, another in an hour nor in a day. Therefore it is enough for us
at this time too have this point made plain and clear, that the promis
whereby God has chosen us intoo the number of his children, was before the
law: and also that the same promis had not any respect to our deseruings, nor
too any worthiness that was in our persons: but too Gods mere goodness and
mercy, which moved him thereunto without looking for any thing in us, because
he saw welynough there was nothing in us but utter misery: And finallye that
the said promis was grounded in our Lord Jesus Christ, who had already done
the ^^ffice of a mediator to make us way unto God his father. This being
granted, we must needs conclude that the promis has abidden and shall abide
for ever, even to the worlds end. And that is said expressly because the Jews
gloried of their auncetrie. But Saint Paul tells them that their father
Abraham had not the law, but was contented though he used sacrifises and such
other like things. And although he was circumcised in the end: yet when he
received the promis, there was not as yet the^ any law written, no nor any
circumcision at all. For Abraham was uncircumcised when he received the promis,
and yet nevertheless was justified before he was circumcised, and all that was
by faith. Saint Paul therefore shows that the Jews were greatly ouerseene,
too shole out themselves after that manner from the rest of the whole wo^ld,
and to rest continually upon the figures of the law, seeing that Abraham their
father and the chief patriarch of the Church was justified the sefsame way
that we must be at this day, that is to say, by Gods mere mercy, because he
knew himself to be a wretched sinner, and therefore accursed and damned in
Adam, and that there was no blissednesse to be hoped for, other than that which
was promised him for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake. Thus ye see what we have
too bear in mind. And for the same cause Saint Paul exhorts us here too
wey well these words when it was said unto Abraham, that all nations of the
earth should be blissed in his seed. Genesis 12. a. 3.
Now there are here two principal points. The one is, that the blissednesse
is promised, not only to Abraham's fleshly offspring (as I have told you already)
but also to all the world in general. We therefore are made partakers
thereof, we I say that are issued of the Gentiles, that is to say, of such as
were heathenfolke and banished from the kingdom of heaven. Although then that
we were not of that holy lineage which God had chosen at the beginning: yet
notwithstanding it behooved salvation to be extended unto us. And why so* For it
had hin promised before, that all Nations should be blissed. Seeing it is so,
shall we say that God has cut off the greatest part of his bounteousnesse,
and will have no more but the said lineage of Abraham, considering that he
has already told us that he would be the savior of the whole world, and
show himself a father in time convenient? Ye see then how the first point
is, that the making of the said promis unto Abraham, was not for his lineage
alone, but for all men: howbeit that it were not fulfilled at the first dash.
For the time of fullness was not yet come as we shall see in the Chapter
following. The second point is, that the blissednesse which was promised to
Abraham was for his seeds sake. For Saint Paul says that God spoke not of
seeds in the plural number as of mo than one: but of one only seed: which
must be concluded to be Jesus Christ. Here it might be supposed that Saint
Paul buzied his head about a needelesse matter. For the word Seed imports a
lineage or offspring, that is to wit, not some one man or ten, or forty, but a
whole people. Therefore the Seed of Abraham is the people that came of him,
which were so many in number, that it was justly said of them, that they
should be as it were twelve Nations. For when mention is made of a people: it
will be thought enough to have a hundred thousand of them together: and there
were many mo in the only tribe of Judah. So then it should seem that Saint
Paul did not sufficiently consider what God meant by the word seed, when he
said that it is but one only man. But we must wey well the things that Saint
Paul presupposes here as fully certain and resolute: and then shall we
perceive his arguments to be utterly infallible. Abraham had not one son
alone: but after Ismaell, he had Isaac also. And what became of his eldest
son? He was cut off from his house, as we shall see within a while, that is
to say in the Chapter following. Behold then, Ismaell which had the
birthright in Abraham's house, is nevertheless put out and made an utter
stranger, Ge. 21. a. 10.
yea and as a rotten member, in so much that it is said of him, Genesis 25. a. 1.
Cast out the son of the handseruante, for he shall not inherit in my house.
Afterward Abraham had other children: but every of them had their portions
given unto them, and were sent away. Genesis 25. c. 22 23.
Thus was only Isaac left at home unto him. Anon after, Isaac had a cupple of
children, and they were twins of one womb. Esau the firstborne, which ought
too have had the prefermente, was likewise cast off, so as he was not
counted for the lineage of Abraham, nor yet was made partaker of the promised
blissing. There was no mo left but Jacob. Yea and although the father blissed
his son Jacob through ignorance and mistaking: Ge. 27. f. 37
yet he declares that it was not in him to revoke, or change the thing that
he had uttered with his mouth, because he was the instrument of the holy
Ghost. Now then if we take the seed of Abraham for all those that came of his
race: The Ismaelites or Agarenes (as they be called) and such other like, and
moreover the Edomites also should be of his household. But the heritage is taken
quite and clean from them. Therefore the seed of Abraham must be considered
after a peculiar fashion. Let us go forward with the whole process. We see
that without faith there should be no bond to knit any Church together, nor any
assurance whereby to know which is the seed of Abraham, or to discern it from
the rest of the world, but by resorting to the head, that is too wit to our
Lord Jesus Christ. Ye see then that the union of the body depends upon the
head, that is to wit upon the Redeemer. Seeing it does so, not without cause
does Saint Paul say that it was not spoken of many seeds, but that we must
come too one man, if we will have the spiritual people: that is to say, if we
will have the Church of God, our Lord Jesus Christ must be the mark that we
must begin to look at, and we must be gathered unto him: and those that are
of his body and cleave unto him by faith are the folk that are reckened for
Gods children and household, and are verily the seed of Abraham, as he
discourses more at large in the Epistle to the Romans, Rom 9. b. 6
where he says that all they which come of the seed of Israel after the
flesh, are not therefore Israelites. And why? For there was but one promised
child, which was Isaac. 2. Cor. 2. b. 19.
So then we must come to our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom all Gods promises
are Yea and Amen, and in whom they have their substance. For without him there
is nothing else but soattering. And therefore it is said in the first Chapter,
to the Colossians, Colos. 1. c. 20.
that our Lord Jesus Christ's office is, to gather together all things that
were scattered, as well in heaven as in earth, and that without him al should
go to wrecke. But now we see more clearly how Saint Paul's meening is, that
before the law was published to the world, (wherevp^^ was put and added this
condition, that it behooved us to fulfill all that is contained therein) God had
yielded a record of his will before hand: which was, that because he saw
mankind damned and forlorn, he intended to draw out a chosen sort to himself,
and to be merciful to them. And that was not for one lineage alone, but for all
nations as the scripture expresses. And there of the foundation was laid in
our Lord Jesus Christ. For as much then as our Lord Jesus Christ was already in
the time of Abraham, ordained to be a mediator to make attoneme^t between God
and us, so that if we go in his name to seek favor, it is ready for us, and
we cannot be disappointed of our hope: seeing it is so stablished, there is no
change, but we must assure ourselves that God accepts us at this day, so we
rest wholly upon our Lord Jesus Christ, knowing that it was no uncertain
covenant which was so ratifyed in his name, but that it shall endure for ever,
and be always of force. Ye see then that we may come freely before God and call
upon him as our father, because he has adopted us for his chidre^, which
thing he has not done in respect of any worthiness that was in us, but of his
own mere mercy, and because we be made one with our Lord Jesus Christ by
faith. And by the way, like as we must reject all opinion and imagination of
obteyning favor at Gods hand by our own deseruings, and of assuring our own
salvation: so must we look well to that which is told us here, namely that we
cannot be partakers of such a benefit but by faith. Now (as I have said before)
faith imports an embracing of Gods mercy, which thing cannot be done except
we be touched earnestly with our own wretchedness: for it is not for naught
that our Lord Jesus Christ sets our cursednesse before us as it were in a
glass, by taking upon him to be accursed for us. Faith therefore cannot be
without repentance, for it is impossible that we should seek our welfare in
God, or desire mercy at his hand, till misery touch us to the quick, and
make us to mislike of it. And so these skoffers which mock God, weltring
still in their vices, and being as it were sotted in them, must not look that
ever Jesus Christ should reckon them in the number of his, for they cannot by
any means come at him, another does he call any other, Mat. 11. d. 28.
than such as are so ouerloden and forweeryed as they can no longer hold out,
and lie groaning under the burden of their sins. Thus ye see how it behooves
us to resort to our Lord Jesus Christ, and that although we cannot bring any
desert unto him, and that all the Ceremonies of the law, and all the profers
that we can make unto him, do nothing at all further our salvation: yet we must
be prepared to such lowliness, as we may perceive our state to be right
miserable, till God have taken us to his mercy: and we must be so beaten down
in ourselves, as we may feel the curse that should light upon us, if we were
not raunsomed with so high and excellent a price, as I have declared
heretofore. Ye see then that by faith we receive the promis of the spirit,
and thereby are linked to our Lord Jesus Christ, and too the spiritual seed
of Abraham. For although we be not borne of his lineage: yet is it enough that
we be made atone with him by faith. For then are we begotten again of that
incorruptible seed whereof S. Peter speaks, ^. Pet. 1. d.
that is to wit of Gods word such as it is contained in the Gospel. And being
so begotten again, we know that God auoweth us too be of the body of his only
son. And although we come of the Gentiles: yet fail we not for all that to
be joined to the Church, whervntoo there needs no more but only faith: and as
for all merits and virtues of men, they must utterly cease in that behalf,
and men must acknowledge that they cannot bring any thing but confusion, so as
they must be feign to seek all at Gods hand, and that by the means which
he himself has appointed. Now since it is so, let us learn to leave our
wandering here and there as we see lightheaded men do, which are never
contented with that which God tells them, but are ever adding somewhat of
their own device. Let us beware of such mingling as shall be treated of more
at large after dinner by Gods will. And let Jesus Christ alone suffice us,
seeing that our welfare depends wholly upon him alone, and we shall want
nothing if we be partakers of him, as we see how Saint Paul brings us
back too that point. Furthermore let us learn also too hold us too Gods
truth, assuring ourselves that he cannot abide too have any adding unto it,
because that were a marring, reuersing, and falsifying of his covenant, wherein
our welfare consists. But when we have once embraced our Lord Jesus Christ,
let us abide fast in him, and let him suffice us for all: and then may we
call upon GOD with full mouth, knowing well that although we be of the race
of cursed Adam, yet notwithstanding for as much as we be blissed again in
Jesus Christ, he acknowledges us always for his Children, because we be
grounded upon the free adoption, which not without cause he willed too be
published through the whole world, to the intent we might have the gate opened
and the way made easy for us to come unto him.

But now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us perceive them more and
more, that we may in such wise mislike of them, as we may labor and indeuer
ourselves to honor and serve him in true obedience all our life long: and
whereas we cannot do it to the full (for that is impossible considering our
frailty) that he will hold us up till he have rid us of all the corruptions of
our flesh, and clothed us again with his own righteousness, the which he
begins in us already as now, and gives us certain firstfrutes of it, to
assure us that he will perform the thing that he has begone. And so let us
all say, Almighty God heavenly father. etc.

The.xx. Sermon, which is the sixth upon the third Chapter.
15. Brethren, I speak after the manner of men. Although it be but a man's
Testament, [yet] if it be proved, no man breaks it, or puts [aught] to it.

16. Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and his seed. He says not, and
to the seeds as speaking of many, but as of one, and in thy seed, which is
Christ.

17. This is it that I say, as touching the covenant that was confirmed before
by God in Christ: the law which came four hundred and thirty years after,
cannot impeach or abolish the promis.

11. For if the inheritance come by the law, then comes it not of promis:
but God gave it to Abraham by promis.


IT were great shame for us if God should bear no more sway with us than
mortal creatures. For what comparison is there betwixt his majesty, and the
state of men which are but a fading shadow? And yet notwithstanding it is an
ordinary matter with men too prefer themselves before God: which is so ougly
a thing, that if the Sun were matched with the darkness of hell, it were not
so great a confusion, as to exalt men above him to whom all honor belongs.
But howsoever the case stand, it is a vice (as I said) which has evermore
reigned and still reigns at this day too much in the world. For look what man
speaks, it shall strayghtways be believed: and if folk be loath to do it of
their own good will, yet must they be feign to hold them to it in all matters
that are allowed by law. Behold, God speaks, yea and that right
substantially, so as he ouerslippeth not any thing that may give credit and
assuredness to his word: and yet notwithstanding we be always in a mamering,
or else we fall to flat reasoning against him. Must it not needs be then that
we be out of our wits, when we diminish Gods authority after that fashion,
and yield more credit to creatures than to him that made both heaven and earth
with his only word, and mainteyneth all things by the same? That is the cause
why S. Paul in this text uses this preface: I speak (says he) after the
manner of men. For if he had said no more but this: Couenantes shall be kept
here bylow without breaking or repealing, and therefore needs must Gods
promis be everlasting: that had bin true, but yet had he spoken too coldly of
Gods majesty, in raunging him so in array among earthly creatures. But whereas
he says that he speaks after the manner of men: it is all one as if he had
said that he uses not such manner of style and speech as might beseem to
treat of the majesty of God. For both the Sun and Moon, ought too forgo
their brightness when Gods glory comes in presence. All of it must needs
be darkened: what shall then become of those that are but as flies and frogs
crauling upon the earth? For make men never so much of their painted sheath,
yet are they less than naught worth before God. Now when we here this, we
should be the more restreyned, that we use no replying, but with all
reverence take in good worth the thing that is told us here: that is too wit,
that if God have voutsafed too give them full assuredness of their salvation,
which receive the promise that is preached unto them: we must not take upon
us to reason against him. For when a deed is passed among men, if it be
entered of record, it shall be received and go for good evidence: and what then
shall be done when God shall have opened his holy mouth to bear us record of
his good will? Is there any solemnity among men that comes near too the
glory of God, who will have us too stick too that which he has spoken and
uttered? True it is (as I have touched already) that we ought to fight against
the lewdness which is rooted in us, too yield credit unto God: for we be
so bent to mistrustfulnesse that not one word of the things which God has
uttered shall ever have settling in our hearts, except we have fought against
the vice wherein we be so sore entangled. So then, every of us when he
comes too be taught in Gods word, must examine what is in himself: and
when he sees him self subject still too many distrustes and doubts, he must
mislike of it, and pray God to touch all his senses in such wise too the
quick, that he may rest wholly upon the thing which he hears [at his hande]
according also as it is the office of the holy Ghost, to seal in our hearts
the truth which is certain enough of it self, howbeeit that it be not
certain unto us, till it be assured too us from above. For if we were of our
own moving inclined to believe God: 2. Cor. 1. d. 22.
the holy Ghost should not need to work in that behalf. Ephesians. 1. c. 13
But it is said, that he is the very Seal wherewith God marketh us, and
whereby* he imprinteth and ingraueth in our hearts the ^^ings which else should
never be received. Yea and we must also mark well, that Saint Paul sets
down here two words, namely that no man diminishes or disanulleth the thing
that is authorized among men by lawful and orderly means, nor also adds any
thing too it. For although we be not always utter rebels, yet are our
wits still tickling us too make some additions and gloses to Gods word, and
we can not abide to hold us to the simplicity that is contained there. Then
if we consider well what we be without self soothing, every of us shall
find two vices in us. The one is, that when God has spoken unto us, we can
not thoroughly consent to say Amen unfeignedly, or to accept his promises, or to
be moved at his threatenings. Men will always use shifts, and we need not
to seek far for example thereof: for (as I said) we have experience of it
in our selves. The other is, that although we yield God his due honor in
believing his word too be true and infallible: yet we will always be
adding unto it, and that do we see too much in the Papacy. Whereof comes
that confusion or mazeworke which we see too be in the serving of God, the
great number and diversity of fashions, and the great store of abuses and
falsehoods, but of that men have not yielded too the things which God shows
them, but have made additions and confused medlies of things that came of their
own brain? In what manner do the Papists indeuer them selves too serve God?
Every man has his several devotion by him self, and therewithal an
infinite number of gewgawes. Their saying is, that the Church has commanded
all: but what soever it be, it is all of man's inuenting. And what a thing is
that? Did not God sufficiently foresee what he would like of? 1. Sa. 15. e. 22.
He tells us that in the Law we have all perfection, and that he will not
have us too hold any other rule. Osee. 6. b. 6.
Again he adds that he had lever have obedientnesse than all the sacrifices
in the world. Mat. 9 b. 13. and 12. a. 7.
His mind is too hold men in awe, that they should not presume to mingle any
thing of their own brain and imagination. But what and if God have said so?
Yet will men bear him down that this and that were good, and they will needs
add a hundred times more than he had ordained. Yea and (which worse is) they
hold scorn of that which he requires, and exacteth most straightly, and in
the mean while magnify fond toys and pelting trash, which not only are of no
value before him, but also loathsome to him, because he disalloweth all things
that men thrust upon him after that fashion to spite him with. Now then we see
hereby how eager and presumptuous also men have always bin, in thrusting
themselves forward to serve God after their own liking: howbeit that was but a
perverting of all the holy scripture. For behold, whereas God tells us that
the chief sacrifice which he demands of us, is that we should resort unto
him, and offer up our requests after the manner which he has appointed to be
the mean for us to come familiarly and boldly unto him, that is to wit, by
making our Lord Jesus Christ our advocate: Men will needs have us pray unto
Saints deceassed, and to make them our patrons and advocates to be a mean
between God and us, when we go about too seek his favor. As much is to be
said of all the rest of their doctrine. God has commanded us too pray one
for another: and they say we must pray for the wretched souls that are in
Purgatory. And who has commanded all this? Men have surmised that so it
should be, and according to their surmising, so it must be. Lo what their
rashness is. God has ordained his sacraments for us too assure us of his
promises by their means, and he will have them to be as Seals of
ouermeasure, that our infirmity may be the better succored. We have
Baptism, whereby God does us to wit, that we be washed and cleansed from all
our spots by the bloodshed of his only son, and that therewithal he
accepts us as his members of his body, and brings us into his Church. Now,
the Papists are not contented with this simplicity, but will needs have
spittle, and taper light, and other gewgawes that are irksome to think of.
And whence come such additions, but of this devilish boldness, that when God
had stablished all that was meet and convenient for the turn, and in such
wise as nothing was to be misliked, men could not find in their hearts too
take it in good worth, but (as I said before) were inflamed with such an over
eagerness and outrage, as they must needs be adding, mingling, changing,
interlacing, and turmoyling without end or measure. So much the more
therefore does it stand us upon, to hold fast that which God shows us by S.
Paul: namely that for as much as God has authorized his word, it is not
lawful for men to add any thing too it, but that all our wisdom is to join
with him, and too receyu^ without scanning what soever comes out of his
mouth. And if this be verified of the promise that was made unto Abraham: much
more reason is it that we now a days should keep the same modesty, seeing we
have much fuller instruction in the Gospel. Truly the substance of the thing
that is preached unto us now a days, differs not from that which Abraham
heard of Gods own mouth. But what soever it be, we have now a much more
familiar manner of teaching, because our Lord Jesus Christ who is the day sun
of righteousness, is manyfested unto us. Seeing then that there is no
hardness at all unto us, if we list to give ear: is it not an intolerable
trayterousnesse, if our lusts be still itching too add one thing or other?
Howsoever we fare, let us learn to hold us to that which God has taught us.
For we may not deal otherwise than with such modesty in that behalf, because
that if we swerve never so little aside from that rule, by and by we be in
Satan's snares, ready to be carried one way or other to all confusion. But let
us be well advised: and seeing that S. Paul says here, that the law could
not any whit impeache the promise which was made before: what shall become of
us in these days, if we will needs have the inventions of men's foolish
heads, to impeache the pureness of the Gospel, so as it may not be
perceived whither God or his creatures be more master? Thus ye see what ought
to hold us in awe, that we pass not our bounds, but that our faith be
always wholly ruled and directed by the single word of God, and that we
reject what soever is added by man. And that is in effect the thing which we
have too gather here. Now as touching that S. Paul says, that the covenant
was established of God toward Jesus Christ four hundred years before the
Law. Herein we see the same thing which I touched this morning: namely that
when God uttered him self to be a father, whether it were toward Abraham, or
toward Noe, or toward any other, it was not but by the means of our Lord
Jesus Christ. For there is as it were a deadly foade between God and man, in
respect that they be corrupted by original sin, in so much that if God let
us alone in our natural plight, surely al our thoughts are cursed, al our
affections are crooked, froward, and full of stubbornness, and al our wits
are bestayned with vices, so that we have not one sound and vninfected place
in us, from the crown of our head to the sole of our foot. And for as much as
we be so contrary to God, and to his will: it must needs be that we are his
enemies, for he can not be unlike him self. Then if God be our enemy, we can
not come to him to hope for any favor or grace at his hand, except Jesus
Christ be as a mean to reconcile us again. Thus ye see that the fathers of
all ages preaced not unto God, but by the guyding of the mediator. And that is
the cause why S. Paul in this text says, that the covenant was made too
Jesus Christ. Truly Jesus Christ had no need of any of the promises that
were made to the fathers of old time, and are continued still by God even unto
this day toward us: but yet did he receive them as head of the Church. So we
see that God had not an eye simply unto Abraham, nor too the worthiness that
was in him, but that Abraham was a member of the Church, whereof Jesus Christ
was always the head. Ps. 89. c. 37.
Also when God chose David too be King, and told him that his seat should
endure as long as the Sun and the Moon in the sky: it was not for any
worthiness that was in David's own person, but it was all done in respect of
our Lord Jesus Christ. And likewise at this day, when God tells us that he
will be favorable too us if we seek him, yea and that he will have us come
boldly unto him: it is not in any other respect than for that our Lord Jesus
Christ has gathered us together to be of his body. And this serves us too
two purposes. The one is too bring us to humility. For if every of us mark
well what he is: we be Gods enemies. By reason whereof the gate is shut
against us, so as we can not hope for any favor at his hand, but rather
feel and conceive him too be our judge, always ready too thunder down upon
our heads, and too ouerwhelme us. Therefore whereas it is said that the
promises are made unto us by the means of our Lord Jesus Christ: we must
shrink down our heads, and acknowledge that Gods only begotten son is his
only derling, and that the favor which we have is only in him [and for his
sake.] Let that serve for the one point. The other is, that the promises have
so much the more certentie in that respect. For if such troubles as these do
come in our minds [so as we think with our selues] what art thou? think thou
that God voutsafeth too stoop down unto thee? Thou art but a worm of the
earth, dust, cinder, and rottenness. Moreover thou have a Sea of vices in
thee, and therefore what a presumptuousnesse were it for thee to think thy
self to be one of Gods children, till he come to seek thee? If we be
tempted after this manner to distrust, let us bethink us of that which is
spoken to us in this text: that is to wit, that the promise was made on the
behalf of Jesus Christ. Although then that there be nothing in us but all
wretchedness, yet it ought to suffice us that there is worthiness, power, and
righteousness inoughe in the son of God, and that he also is the person in
whom we receive the promises. Now remains for us too know, by what means
we come unto God: namely by the [promised] seed, which is but only one, as S.
Paul adds: For if men turn never so little from our Lord Jesus Christ, by
and by they be cut off from the kingdom of heaven. And if this was spoken too
beat down the pride and false presumption that was among the fleshly children
of Abraham: what is to be said to us, which are but afterbirthes borne out of
time in comparison of them, as S. Paul terms us in the tenth to the Romans?
Wherefore let us understand that all such as content not them selves with our
Lord Jesus Christ, do utterly renounce al hope of their salvation. For there
are not two or three, but only one Mediator (says S. Paul) like as it is not
said, that there is any more than one seed. I have told you already, that
many come of Abraham's lineage, which yet notwithstanding were not heirs of the
promise. Then if we come not to Jesus Christ to be gathered unto him: surely
God disclaymeth us, and tells us that we be none of his, and that he will
have none acquayntance at all with us. Therefore although the world go astray to
be tossed too and aad fro, according as we see how on the one side the Papists
have infinite means to come unto God, and likewise on the other side the
Turks and the Jews, all which have quite forsaken our Lord Jesus Christ: yet
let us lean wholly unto him, and assure our selves that if we be once
ingreffed into his body by faith, and made one with him, the promises belong
unto us. Why so? For they were given unto him, not for his own commodity, as
I have said already (for he had no need of them) but for our behoof that we
might be made partakers of them. Thus ye see in effect how we ought to make
our profit of this text. But we have too mark also, concerning the
antiquity which S. Paul treats of here, that the doctrine of the Gospel
is no new devised thing, nor a thing that had bin unknown of before: but that
God has continually ever since Abraham's time unto this day, called us to be
his adopted children, and proved him self to be our father. Truly it was even
before Abraham was borne: nevertheless it must suffice us, that as then there
was made so full discovery of it, as we know that God did then begin to
publishe the things that are contained in the Gospel at this day, and that the
fathers had none other way whereby to come to salvation, than the same that is
showed us at this day. And this is very needful for us. For many busy bodies
do now unskillfully imagine, that the Gospel was never heard of before: yea
and there are of these scorners of God, and heathenishe fellows, who to embrace
the authority of God, and of his Gospel, say it came up within these sixteen
hundred years, and that it was never heard of in the world before. What (say
they)? had God forsaken the world quite and clean? As who should say, we saw
not with our eyes, and might not feel with our fingers, that God never varied,
but that even at such time as it pleased him to adopt Abraham, then were we
also included in him, and the gate of salvation was opened unto us* howebeit
that the accomplishment thereof came not till the full time was expired, as I
have declared this morning, and shall declare more at length in time
convenient. Ephesians. 3 b. 9*
And here ye see why S. Paul says that the preaching of the Gospel was a
secret that had bin kept hidden from the beginning of the world. But yet had
God determined it before, and made sufficient promise of it, as we have seen.
Here ye see also why we be called Abraham's offspring. For we belong no whit
at all to him in respect of the flesh. But faith is a sufficient bond too
knit us unto him. Furthermore we see that our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the
pledge of men's welfare, is now revealed unto us, too the end that we should
have the better assurance that we be* his, and that he will hold us for the
members of his body. And that is the cause why Christ said that Abraham saw
his day, and was glad of it. The Jews alleged the worthiness of the
Patriarch: yea (says Christ) as though your father Abraham had not rested upon
the things that were spoken too him concerning me. Ioh. 8. g. 56
Therefore he saw my day, and it was the thing wherein he took all his
comfort, in so much that he had not any other hope of salvation, than by the
belief which he had in the doctrine which is preached unto you at this day by
the Gospel. That also is the very same thing that is spoken of John Baptist by
the Prophet Malachie, Mal. 4. b. 6.
namely that he was sent to knit the hearts and minds of the fathers to the
children. And this is not spoken only of the person of John Baptist, but it
belongs also to the doctrine of the Gospel. Ye see then that the thing
whereunto our Lord calls us, is that although Abraham be rotten in the earth
so long time ago: yet we may assure our selves, that there is none other
promise than that for us too trust unto, so we be knit unto him by faith, and
do so agree together as we can call upon God with the same mind wherewith he
was governed, according as in very deed he had his mind fixed upon our Lord
Jesus Christ. Now then for so much as we be united unto Abraham, let us
tend to our Lord Jesus Christ, and let him be our aming mark, and our shoot
anchor, till we be all assembled together, and gathered up into the heavenly
kingdom. Lo what we have to consider when mention is made of the promise that
was made before the law. Yea and we ought to be greatly provoked to
constancy, when we perceive that our father Abraham did always wait for our
Lord Jesus Christ, although it were so long ere he should be discovered to
the world, and it was told him that his seed should be hilde prisoners in a
strange land. After that God had told him that all the world should be
blissed in his seed: he adds, and yet for all that, think not that this
shall be performed within these two or three days, or a hundred years
hence: for thou thy self must first die, thou thy self must first be
conveyed hence intoo a strange country, where thine offspring shall be
oppressed with all tyranny and cruelty. Assure thy self I will be reuendged
of it, but yet must thy seed smart in the mean while. Abraham herd all this:
Again after that the law was given, there passed other two thousand years
more ere our Lord Jesus Christ came. Now could Abraham never have trusted
too that which was spoken too him, if he had not bin armed with heavenly power,
for he himself could not enjoy the benefit that was offered him, another
should his children enjoy it that were too come. Ye see then that two thousand
and four hundred years were then to pass, Hebr. 11. b. 18.
and yet notwithstanding Abraham repented him not that he had forsaken his
fathers house, (as the Apostle declares in the eleventh too the Hebrews) but
hilde on his race still, albeit that God intended too try his patience too the
vttermoste. Of much more reason ought we now adays too go on steadfastly
whither soever God calls us, and too hold up our heads till we come too the
crown of glory, not withstandyng that as now it be hidden from us, and that
we must be feign too believe and hope for things that surmount all our
capacity and which we cannot perceive. Thus ye see how we ought too put
this text in ure. Now hereupon S. Paul concludes, that if the inheritance
come by the law, it shall not come by faith. But God gave Abraham all things
in respect of faith: and therefore it is too be concluded, that the Law must
needs cease when men go about to get favor at Gods hand, and the praise of
our salvation must be yielded all wholly unto him. S. Paul in speaking here
of inheritance, meeneth two things. The one is that what soever God has at any
time promised us, is of his own mere free goodness: for an inheritance is
not a wages or hyre. True it is that a father in giving his children their
heritage may well say, See how I take pains for you. Mark what shall come of
it. Ye shall have my goods among you. But yet how soever the father deal
with them, he has none other respect than too his own kinship. He laboreth
and takes great pains too provide for such as are so alied unto him. Seeing
then that heritages are things of free gift among men: we must not take
eternal life as a deserved wages or hyre at Gods hand. For why, it is an
heritage. Mark it for a sure ground, that here all worthiness of men is
excluded. For when a man makes his children his heirs, he passes not whither
they have done any great work or no, or whither they be fair or foul, or
whither they be one thing or other: but it is enough for him that they be his
children, and that his mind is too provide for them. Another point is, that
Saint Paul in so saying, gives us an incling that we be all of us utterly
rejected of God, so as we cannot (no not even in this transitory life) enjoy
any thing at all, but by the only mere grace of God. True it is that the
Sun shyneth as well upon the faythlesse as upon the faithful, and all men
are nurrished alike with the things that God gives and grants unto them:
but yet howsoever they fare, the unbelievers possess not any thing by just
title. They are but thieves, and must yield account of the benefits and
goods which they have received of God, even too the last drop of water,
because they were not sanctified, but defiled them as much as in them lay,
because they had no faith, which (as says Saint Paul) is the thing whereby
the benefits that God gives unto us are made clean. 1. Tim. 4. b. 5.
That is the way for us too use them lawfully: but let faith be away, and
there shall be nothing else but uncleanness. For why, if my hands be foul,
and I handle the preciousest things in the world with them, they shall be
rayed with the filthiness of my hands. Even so is it when we abuse Gods
benefits. The unbelief that is in us defiles all: and in the end, all
creatures must cry out for vengeance upon us, because we abused them if we
possessed them not with faith.

Ye see then that we cannot enjoy any thing at all, unless we be Gods
children. And for the same cause also, Saint Paul in the fourth too the
Romans, Romans 4. c. 13.
thinks it not enough too set down the heavenly life and everlasting
salvation: but also names the heritage of the world, and says that Abraham
was made heir of the world, and that the same was not for that man alone, but
for all men in general. Therefore whereas God adopteth us and tells us
that he will be gracious unto us, it is too the end that while we live here
beneath, we should be fed by his hand, and he in giving us food make us
too taste aforehand of the love which he bears us, and of the care that he
has over us. Too be short, we may and ought also too behold Gods fatherly
goodness in all his creatures. Do we open our eyes and look upon the light
of the Sun? Even there does God show himself a father toward us. When
we eat and receive our sustenance, God reaches out his hand too show, that
we be already fed by him as his own children. Too be short, in all
things and by all means he makes us too taste his fatherly love aforehand,
too the intent we should be confirmed in the things that he shows us in
the Gospel: that is too wit, that he has reserved a better heritage for us,
as for his children whom he has adopted. Then must all creatures direct us
unto heauenward. But surely we do the clean contrary: for we apply Gods
creatures to our own lusts, so as we behilde down still by them here. To
be short, look how many helps God has given us too draw us too him: so
many lettes have we too hold us back in the world. For we never pass too
know how we should be reckened for Gods children, so we may live at our
ease in this world: that is enough for us. But yet for all that, it stands
us greatly on hand too perceive, that God does already in this world show
himself a father toward us, and intends too do us too wit what a care he
has of us, too the end we should learn too refer our selves wholly unto
him, and there too rest. Ye see then, that by this word Heritage or
Inheritance, God shows, first that whatsoever he offers us is of his own
mere free bounteousnesse: and secondly that we be so cursed, that we have
no right too any thing, no not even too a drop of water: except God make us
his heirs, and that must be done all only for our Lord Jesus Christ's
sake. And therefore we must once again call to rememberance how we have
heretofore seen, that the promis was made too Jesus Christ. Then is not
Abraham the stay and shoot anchor thereof. Hebr. 1. a. 2.
And for that cause also is our Lord Jesus named the heir of all things: and
look what he has peculiar too himself, that doothe he communicate too us, as
too the members of his body. In that respect also does S. Paul say, 1. Cor.
15. d. 27.
that the saying which is written in the seventh verse of the eight Psalm,
(which is, that he is made Lord of all things) ought too be applied first of
all to his person. True it is that the said text is spoken of all men,
according as we see how God has put all beasts of the earth in subjection to
man, so as they be feign too die too give us sustenance, and too clothe us and
keep us warm. Again, we see how the earth yields us fruits. Therefore the
lordship of the world is given unto us, how beit, that is but by the means
of our Lord Jesus Christ. For (as I have touched already) if we be
separated from him, we be forthwith so cut of from Gods house, that the
inheritance of them belongs no more unto us, than too the furthest
strangers in the world. But now let us come too the chief point that is
contained here. S. Paul says, that this heritage comes not of the Law,
but of Faith. Whereas he uses these two speeches, and cuppleth them
toogither: they be things flat contrary as I have told you heretofore. Not
that the law is contrary too faith: but because that too be justified before
God, and too obtain favor and mercy at his hand, cannot come too pass by
the Law. The Law was not given too that end, (as we shall see in the next
Sermon) but too the clean contrary. So then, seeing that the heritage comes
by faith: we must conclude that our works can do nothing, and that we must
be feign too come to God utterly empty, as poor beggars too crave too be
filled by him, because we have not one drop of goodness in our selves. Ye
see then whereat S. Paul ameth, when he says that the inheritance comes of
faith and not of the law, according also as God gave it unto Abraham in
respect of faith. And let us mark, that if we be not able too deserve any
nurrishment in this world: what shall we be able too do toward the
possessing of the kingdom of heaven? When there is any talking of corruptible
sustenance, it is nothing in comparison of the heavenly glory. 1. Cor. 15. d.
28.
For it is said that we shall be made parttakers of the glory of our God,
and that then we shall be all in all things. But as now we cannot deserve so
much as one bit of bread: for the inheritance comes of faith: that is to say,
all that ever God has promised men, is of his own mere free goodness. And
how can we then purchase the Realm of Paradise? what a pride is it for men
to presume to come to it by their own strength? must it not needs be that they
are carried away with a terrible rage? Moreover, in saying that God gave all
things to our father Abraham in respect of his faith, S. Paul does yet better
express and show that which I have told you already: namely that man is able
to deserve nothing of himself, and that he must be feign too have all of free
gift. He had said before, (as we have seen already) that the promises were made
and uttered: but here he uses the word Giving. As if he should say, here is
not a bargayne between party and party, too say I will do this, and thou
shall do that: I will sell, and thou shall buy: but God does freely give, and
man does but only receive. Seeing then that we must come unto God to receive
that which he offers us, and that we have not any other title to the things
that we look for at his hand, than only by free gift: let us forget all the
worthiness which we imagine to be in our selves, and acknowledge that we be
nothing. And surely S. Paul uses one other manner of speech, which serves to
express better the thing that is meant here: which is, that if the heritage
came by the Law, the promis were disanulled, and so consequently faith.
Therefore to be sure of the promis, the heritage must needs come by faith. And
my alleging hereof, is because the thing that is spoken in this text, might
seem darksome by reason of the shortness of it: namely that the heritage of
salvation, yea and all the benefits that God bestows upon us in this world,
must proceed of our faith: that is too say, without bringing any thing at all
of our own, but only by receiving all things of Gods free gift. For why? Put
the case that we should hope too receive according too our works, according
to our own worthiness, and according too our deserts toward God: how
might we be sure of the promises? Truly we should hang always in a
mamering: for it would behoue us still too consider thus, very well, how haste
thou discharged thy self? what haste thou done? And so should faith be
utterly dashed. But faith ought too assure us fully of Gods good will toward
us: which thing it should not do, but we should hang still in doubt, and
it should be but a bare opinion, and that opinion should be but an illusion
of Satan. For all they which think too have any thing by their own power,
must needs be bewitched by the Devil. Ye see then how it is too gross a
mockery, when we think too deserve aught at Gods hand. But howsoever we go
to work, though our eyes be seeled up with hypocrisy, and we take our selves
too be wonderful fellows: yet can we not have any certainty in us without
faith. For he that once done away, by and by the promises fall to the ground:
we can have none assurance of them. Therefore we must conclude that the
heritage comes by faith, too the end we may have no more pride in us: that
is to wit, too the end we hope not any more that we can be able too do aught
of our selves, or that we have any free will to take or refuze the grace that
is offered us. We must forget all the things which men are wont to chalendge
to themselves: all must be laid underfoot: we must come void of all power,
empty, and hungry, and seek at Gods hand the things that we want, and not
doubt but that he has enough in himself to succor us with, and that he has
also put into our Lord Jesus Christ all things that we can wish, and all that
he knows to be for our behoof and profit. Thus ye see how we may enjoy
the heritage that has bin promised us in all ages, and which God offers yet
still at this day by the doctrine of the Gospel.

And now let us cast our selves down before the Majesty of our good God with
acknowledgement of our sins, praying him too make us perceive the^ more and
more, that it may cause us to walk in such wise in his fear, as we may seek
nothing but too dedicate our selves wholly unto him, and that according as he
sees us wrapped in feebleness and corruption, it may please him too clenze us
thereof by his holy spirit, and to bear with us too the end. That it may
please him to grant this grace, not only to us, but also too all people and
nations of the earth etc.

The. 21. Sermon, which is the seventh upon the third Chapter.
19 VVheretoo then serves the Law? It was added because of transgression,
till the seed came too whom the promis was made: and it was ordained by
Angels in the hand of a Mediator.

20. Now a Mediator is not of one, but God is one.


We have seen heretofore, that before the giving of the Law, God had
already showed his goodness, yea even his free goodness in the lineage of
Abraham, too the end that the Jews should not have any other leaningstocke for
their salvation, than the said promis that God would have pity upon them and
show them mercy, in sending them a Redeemer, by whom they should obtain
forgiveness of their sins. Herevppon S. Paul infers, that the law which
came after the promis, must not disanul that which God had already ordained and
concluded: howbeit that in the mean while it might seem that the law was
added too help the promis, as though the promis had bin weak of it self. For
after the same manner does the Apostle reason in the Epistle to the Hebrews:
Hebr. 8. b. 7.
and because it is said by the Prophet Jeremy, that God will give a new law,
that is too wit the Gospel: the Apostle infers, that then it must needs
follow that the law which was given by Moses was weak and had no such
perfection in it as a man might trust unto. It may well seem at the first
blush, that a man might say as much on the contrary part: namely that for
as much as the law was given after the promis, it was done for some
accomplishment because the promis was not sufficient of it self, unless it
borrowed perfection else where, for otherwise the law might seem too be
needelesse. But it were against all reason that God should have given a
needelesse doctrine. Therefore it stands us on hand too know too what
purpose the law serves, and too what end it was given, or else we shall
always be of opinion that the promis was insufficient, and could not save us
but in part. Herevpo^ S. Paul declares, that God in giving of his law had a
far other meenyng and intent, than they imagine which seek their
righteousness in it, and make it the means of their salvation. For it was
given (says he) because of transgression: not for that there needed a bridle
because the world was wicked and froward: for we know there were laws and
statutes made among men, according too the vices that had need too be
redressed. If all men were Angels, so as there were nothing out of square,
but every man behaved himself well of his own accord, so as there needed no
amendment: then were Laws too no purpose at all. What is the cause then that
we have need of so many laws and statutes? The naughtiness of men, because
they cease not too rush out intoo all evil, and therefore remedy is feign to
be provided for it: like as if there were no diseases, there should need no
phisike: but men's unruliness causes diseases, and therefore remedies must
needs be provided. So then seeing that men have need to be bridled and as it
were restreyned, it is a sure record that they are bent too all evil, and
utterly froward of their own nature. But S. Paul meant not after that sort in
his forementioned saying: He intended too pass further: namely that God
purposed too bewray men's wickedness by means of the Law. And this reason
is peremptory, too show that we be not able to purchase rigtuousnesse: for
heat and cold come not both out of one spring. If a fountain be sweet,
there is no seeking of bitterness in it: but clean contrariwise, if a
fountain be bitter or brackish, sweet water must be sought for in another
spring. Even so is it with the Law. And wherefore was it given? To prove men
double guilty before God, that their hypocrisy might not stand them in any
more stead, nor they have occasion to flatter themselves any more, or too
shrowde themselves under their vain excuces as they have bin wont too do. And
that is the cause why S. Paul in the fourth too the Romans, Romans 4. c. 15
reasons that a man cannot be justified by the Law. For (says he) the Law
brings nothing but wrath. And by the word wrath he meeneth Gods vengeance.
Life and death cannot come both of the Law, but in sundry respects. Now the
Law is deathfull unto all of us, so that it condemns us and shows us that
we be all cursed and abominable before God: and therefore what a fo^dnesse is
it to seek righteousness by it, as who should say that God ought to take us
into his favor for the keeping of it? But he declares this matter more
familiarly in the.vii. to the Romans, when he says that by the Law sin
becomes out of measure sinful. Romans 7. b. 8
For there is enough to condemn us though there were no law at all, according
as it is said, that they which sin without law, To. 2. b. 12.
shall perish without law, that is to wit, although the heathen folk had no
instruction whereby to be rebuked: yet had they a record engraven in their
consciences, which did find them guilty. Ye see then that men are sufficiently
worthy to be condemned though God go not up into his judgment seat, nor cite
them, nor examine them, howbeeit that such as sin and offend against God,
charge not themselves with their faults. For we be so given to selfsoothing;
that every of us weltereth and sleeps in his own filth, insomuch that till
the law touch us too the quick, our consciences are as it were benumbed, and
to be short, every man dispenses with himself, and takes leave too do
evil. But when the Law steppeth forth, then is sin known, and every man
spite of his teeth, must be feign to stoop before God, or else gnashe his
teeth at him as a rebel. Nevertheless God gathers us too him by the law,
by bringing us to the knowledge of our cursednesse. To be short, it is al one
as if a man had his face all berayed: every man might mock at him, but he
himself should not see it. But if one bring him a glass, he is ashamed of
himself, and hydes his face, and goes his way too wash his face when he sees
it so disfigured with filthiness. Or if a man be so ill favored that he
makes folk afraid with his look: he thinks not that that fault comes of
his own person, till he have a looking glass set before him. Even so is it
with us. For though all of us be saped in wickedness and sin, insomuch that
heaven and earth are ashamed of us, and God prepares horrible condemnation for
us: yet cease we not too keep on our race and to be retchlesse still. And why
so? For our sinfulness is unknown to us; and hypocrisy does so blindfolde
our eyes, that we perceive not our own cursednesse. But the Law shows us
what we be, and therewithal sets Gods judgment before us. For on the one
side it says, ye shall do all these things under pain of cursing. And what
manner of things are they? it is not enough for us to absteyne only in respect
of our feet, hands, eyes, and ears: but we must be pure and clear from all
lusting: there must be such an vncorruptnesse in us, that all our senses,
thoughts, and affections must ame at God, so as no inticements of this world
may hold us back. And where is this to be found? Besides this, behold, God
being set as a Judge in his seat, has already given sentence of
cursednesse upon us as soon as we be found too be transgressers as we
be. Ye see then that mankind is in miserable taking. And that is it that
Saint Paul meant in this Text, when he said that the Law was added for
transgression. It is true that the Law serves too other purposes also:
namely, first of all, too show us the way too serve God. But we know that
he will be honored with obedience, and not have every of us too behave
himself after his own lyking. The Law therefore gives us the difference
between good and evil. For what is the reasonable service which we owe unto
God? It is too submit our selves too his will, To. 12. a. 1.
says Saint Paul. Seeing it is so, ye perceive that the Law serves to
excellent good purpose: namely that whereas we labor in vain too serve God
after our own imagination, it shows us the way in such wise as we cannot
mysse, and gives us the rule which we ought too keep by. Furthermore, when
Saint Paul said that the Law was given because of transgression, it came not
in his mind to rehearse all the fruit and profit which the Law brings with
it: for (as I have said already) it serves also for our instruction, that
we might learn too discern between good and evil: and again it quickens
us up, as though God should give us strokes with the spur, too make us
apply our selves the more diligently unto him. But he spoke according too this
present matter, and according too the ground of the text that he treats of.
Now then he shows that the Law is not superfluous, and yet that it serves
not to bring us too righteousness, but in stead thereof caryeth us to such
confusion, that we must needs be found to be double sinners, and are more
condemned, and less excusable than before, so as there is nothing before us
but a bottomless goulfe. Lo to what end the Law was given us. But he says
that it was added too the promise, whereby we be done too understand, that
the adding of it was not for that the promise was weak of it self, and unable
to bring men to salvation, so as there should need some other incomme: it was
nothing so, says Saint Paul: but it was added too make men know that God
had rightfully condemned them all, and that they could not have any relief,
but should be continually tormented with such unquietness that they should
be always in despair, till they rested themselves upon the said promise.
Now if it be alleged that the promise might have served that turn before: the
answer and solution is very easy. For although God in offering himself to
be our Savior, do thereby show that we be all damned in our selves till he
have pity upon us: yet can we not be helped as were requisite, until such
time as he scare us. By his promise he calls us gently, and after a
fatherly manner: and no doubt but the same ought to make us perceive our
miseryes, and to be sorry for them: but we be so fast asleep in our sins,
that we never think on them, except we be compelled. Although then that upon
Gods making of the promise, men had cause to lament their sins, to the end
they might rest themselves wholly upon the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: yet
did they it not, till God had stricken them as it had bin with many blows of a
Beetle upon the head, which thing he did by the Law. Moreover Saint Paul
shows, that we abuse the gentleness of our God through our unthankfulness,
because that the more courteous he shows himself toward us, the more
occasion do we take thereby too flatter our selves. Therefore he must be
feign too rouse us up, and to make us feel what we be, thereby too scare us
and drive us too seek his favor in good earnest. Thus ye see what the word
Added imports. It is all one if Saint Paul should blame us for that we
make not our profit of Gods goodness, seeing he allureth us so gently unto
him, and shows himself as meelde as may be: but grieve him, and after a
sort enforce him too use rygour against us, too beat us down by that means,
and so to prepare us too the seeking of his grace, the which we shall find in
our Lord Jesus Christ whenever we list. And heerewythall Saint Paul
adds, that the Law served but till the seed came to whom the promise was
made.

This concerns properlye the Ceremonies, or else we must take it too be
spoken of the Law with all his appurtenances, circumstances and appendants as
men term them. If we take the Law for no more but the ten commandments, the
thing that S. Paul speaks will not stand. For the law must even at this
day have such force with us, as to be our rule of good life, and to show us
Gods will, that we may not live like vagabondes, and gad abroad at aladuenture,
but have our way plain before us. The law then is not transitory in respect
of showing us what is good, for it must continue to the worlds end. But we
must mark Saint Paul's discourse: for he takes the law, as containing the
promises and threatenings, Leu. 18. a. 5
and also the Ceremonies. Then on the one side there is [this promise,] Deuteronomy.
27. d. 26.
he that does these things shall live in them, as we have seen heretofore.
And on the other side there is this threat, cursed is he that fulfilleth not
all that is contained here. Now the law (as we see) promises salvation to
none but such as live purely and incorruptly: but all of us come short of that,
and therefore the promise of the law is to no purpose. Mark that for one
point. If it be alleged, what Sir? Meant God too mock men? I say, no: but
they have always beguiled themselves with vainglorie and presumption, bearing
themselves in hand that they could purchase their own salvation: and
therefore God is feign too say unto them, Goto, if ye be so able men as ye
think, show it: as for me, I give you my Law, and because you shall not
think your selves ill dealt with for your serving of me, your wages is ready
for you if you perform it. Behold, I assure you of everlasting life out of
hand: now let me see a little what you can do, buskle your selves to your
work. But when men have tried the uttermost that is in them, surely they shall
perceive their own weakness which was hidden before. Thus ye see that the
promise of the Law can have none effect toward us, and yet it is not
guilefull, for it serves us to another end. As touching the threats of it,
it is infallible, for we be all damned by this threatening, Cursed is he that
performs not all. But we come so far short of performing all, that there is
not one point but we fail of it. If we think too serve God by halues, it is
nothing: for he has not separated one piece from another, but will that he
which walks in chastity, shall also abstain from theft, robbery, craft,
extortion, and all other sins. Seeing it is so, let us mark that the threate
holds all shet up under it, and that is the thing that Saint Paul had an eye
unto. As touching the Ceremonies, they were a confirmation that all of us are
accursed, according as I have told you, how Saint Paul in his Epistle to the
Collossians, Col. 2. c. 14
lykeneth them to obligations and autenticall evidence, that serve too hold a
man most straytly bound. If a man have borrowed a piece of money, he is a
detter, and gives a bill of his hand for it. But if he bind his goods or
body for it by recognisance [or Statute,] so as his deed is enrolled of
common Record: then is he bound more straytly than he was before. Even so is
it with the Ceremonies. The law of it self was enough too condemn men
because they are all offenders: howbeeit forasmuch as God saw the pride that is
rooted in our nature, he added the Ceremonies for an overplus, to the end they
should be as a solemn bond against us. But now Saint Paul says, that all
this geere served but till the promised seed were come: that is too wit, that
the law served not too hold those in slavery and bondage which put their
trust in our Lord Jesus Christ, but to bring them to him, that there they
might find the thing which they wanted in the law. So then we see that Gods
using of rygour in condemning of us, procures our welfare, and his thundering
upon us after that fashion is a witness of his singular goodness toward
us. And why so? I have told you already, and experience shows it too much,
that we cease not to abuse his gentleness, and too draw it clean contrary
to his meening. Therefore he is feign to rouse us up, and to show himself to
be our judge, and to make us here this dreadful sentence, able to cast us
into despair, that there is nothing for us to look for but everlasting death:
and finally too confirm and ratify the same sentence still. Yea but all this
is but too make us stoop, that being at our wits end, we should flee to
our Lord Jesus Christ with a true and unfeigned zeal, and learn to rest upon
him when we be troubled with unquietness and torment of conscience. Thus ye
see why Saint Paul has said expressly, that the law was given too continue
no longer, than till the promised seed was come. Now if a man demand, how
then did the fathers obtain salvation? I answer, that the law reigned and
had his full scope as in respect of outward order before the coming of our
Lord Jesus Christ: but yet for all that the fathers myssed not too resort too
the grace that was promised them, although they saw it not, as we shall see
more plainly hereafter. Then is it a thing utterly out of all doubt, that the
Law did nothing prejudice the promise, nor was added for any help of it, as
though the promise had not bin sufficient of it self too salvation: but that
it served too correct men's pride and presumptuousnesse, too the end they
might with all lowliness seek the mercy that is proffered them in Jesus
Christ, and by his means be able to receive it and enjoy it. And heerevpon
Saint Paul adds, that the Law was ordained or delivered by the hand of
Angels, and in the hand of a Mediator. Here he authoriseth the Law, too
show that it ought to be received with all reverence, but yet not be applied
too any other end than God has appointed. For proof hereof he speaks of
the Angels, as if he had said that God had witnesses ynow to give authority to
his Law, and therewithal showed how it ought to be taken and herd. But the
cheifest matter is in his setting down of the Mediator: that is to wit, our
Lord Jesus Christ. True it is that many men have taken this saying to be meant
of Moses, as though he had bin called the Mediator between God and men, as in
respect of doctrine: but that can by no means stand. For Paul does first
set down the Angels, and afterward adds the Mediator as chief, and he is
here in higher degree than they, which cannot be verified of the person of
Moses. Moreover we see what Saint Paul discourses. He shows that there was
no diversity between the Law and the Gospel in the free promise of
salvation. For the confirming thereof, he brings in our Lord Jesus Christ,
and says, that when the Law was given, it was done by his hand and
direction. Truly this word Hand in the holy Scripture does oftentimes
import, force, power, or strength: but here we see how Saint Paul makes
comparison between Jesus Christ and the Angels. He sets down the Angels
that were assembled there to make his Law to be heard among men, and too be
received of them without gainsaying. Therefore they were as witnesses of Gods
Majesty: but he sets down the Mediator as the greater. The hand
therefore imports direction, as if he had said, that he had highest place,
and was chief Commissioner in setting out the Law. And we must not think
this strauuge: for when the Angel appeared unto Moses, Exo. 3. a. 6.
he said, I am the Everlasting. There he is named an Angel. Therefore is
he Gods messenger as the word betokens: and yet notwithstanding he says,
I am the Everlasting, that have my being of my self: which saying could not
be verified of any creature: and as for the Angels they were made of nothing as
well as we. Then had it bin high treason for an Angel too have taken upon
him the title that agrees to none but God alone. Therefore must we conclude,
that that Angel was Jesus Christ, 1. Co* 10. b. 9.
who executed the office of Mediator aforehande, accordingly as Saint Paul
treats thereof in the first too the Corinthians, where he speaks of the
Jews rebelliousnesse, and of their provoking of God to displeasure by their
murmuring and wicked lusts. He says that they tempted Jesus Christ which led
them and guided the^ through the wilderness. No doubt therefore but that our
Lord Jesus Christ was even the^ the Mediator, yea even to reconcile men to God
his father after diverse manners. And here ye see why the Apostle in the
Epistle too the Hebrews says that the same Jesus Christ which is too day,
Heb. 13. b. 8
was yesterday, and shall be still tomorrowe even too the worlds end, too
the intent that men should hold themselves too him, and not wander any more
in strange doctrines. But now he adds, Jesus Christ then has bin a mean
betwixt God and men, to the intent that poor sinners might find some relief,
and that although they had some hartbytings by being troubled with Gods
judgments, yet nevertheless they might also be comforted, seeing that God
offered the^ a Mediator by whom they might obtain grace to come unto him.
Howbeeit Jesus Christ is our Mediator after another fashion also, which is that
by him God has always communicated himself to men. For there is such a
distance betwixt God and us, so long as we be estraunged from him by sin:
that we cannot come at him. And he will not come down too us for his part,
Ge. 28. b. 12
except it be by the Mediator, according also as it is showed in Jacobs vision
in Genesis. For there it is said, that Jacob saw a Ladder, upon the top
whereof sat God in his Majesty, and the Angels went up and down upon that
ladder. And no doubt but that in that figure or Image, our Lord Jesus Christ
was represented unto Jacob, to show that men are banished from Gods kingdom,
till there be a mean that reaches up from beneath, as our Lord Jesus Christ
does, who being on the one side God manifested, does surmount all the heavens,
and on the other side, being joined unto us in that he is clothed with our
nature, and is become a man, (yea even a frail and mortal man, sin
excepted,) has taken upon him and borne our infirmities, though he himself
were without spot. So then, ye see how the law was given long ago by the
hand of our Lord Jesus Christ. Whereupon it follows that there is no
contrariety between the Law and the Gospel. For Jesus Christ is always one
without any variableness. Now let us see what Saint Paul adds, namely that
the Mediator is not of one, but that God is one. In saying that the Mediator is
not of one, he meeneth that our Lord Jesus Christ came too gather toogither
again all things that were scattered both in heaven and earth, accordingly
also as he speaks of it in the first too the Collossians. Col. 1. c. 20.
Truly some have taken the meening of this text to be, that Jesus Christ was
of mo natures than one, or that although he were the Mediator between God and
men, yet did it not follow that there was diversity between the Law and the
Gospel. But doubtless, Saint Paul's meening here, is to gather again the
Jews, and the Gentiles: as if he had said, Jesus Christ was the Mediator in
giving of the Law, as the party by whose means god meant to humble men, that
they might be partakers of his grace. Howbeit let us mark that our Lord Jesus
Christ who was the continual Mediator in giving the Law too the Jews, had
therewithal a Commission that stretched yet further: that is to wit, to gather
and knit together again the Gentiles, which were estraunged from God. For
although God did for a time prefer the lynage of Abraham before all the rest
of the world: yet notwithstanding in the end our Lord made us parttakers of
the salvation whereunto we were strangers, and it behooved us that were far
off, to be gathered together again, as those that had bin near neighbors
before. And therefore Saint Paul in another text calling Jesus Christ our
peace, Ephesians. 2. d. 17
says that he has joined and knit us unto God, even us that had bin near him
before, as well the Jews which had the Law, as those that had bin utterly
divided from them. They that erst had none acquayntance with God, were in the
end gathered together again into the body of the Church at the coming of the
anointed, and so were they also which had heretofore bin separated a great way
off, not only from God, but also one from another. Now we see S. Paul's
meaning. Howbeit, that we may profit the better by this text, let us mark
that as God has given us his Law by the Angels: so shall they bear witness
against us if the Law bear no sway with us, and that we make none account of
it, but do as it were tread it under our feet. Then shall the Angels be
armed too ask vengeance at Gods hand against our wickedness and rebellion.
For it was no babes play when God willed his Angels too be present and
assisting at the publishing of his Law. Therefore it was to the end it should
be received with all reverence. Now it is true that we can not perform all
that the Law commands, and if we should stand upon that point, we should
be plunged into everlasting death, and utterly overwhelmed in despair. But
first of all, seeing that God is so gracious too us as too teach us his will,
too the end we should discern between good and evil: let us bow down our
necks, and receive the yoke that God lays upon us, to make us subject unto
him. Let that serve for one point. And for as much as the Law does quicken
us, and cheer us up when we be hartfrosen, and when there is such sloth
and slownesse in us as we can not come unto God: Let every of us look well
too him self, and early and late call too mind Gods commandments, to
reprove our selves withal. Then let us bethink our selves better, seeing that
the Angels keep watch and ward about us, and will not (now after that God
has given them in charge to authorize his Law) suffer us to despise it, and
misuse it as if it were a thing of nothing. Furthermore, as touching that the
Law curses us: let us assure our selves that although men commend us, and
clap their hands at us for joy, yet shall we be put to shame before the Angels
of heaven. Then if (...) whole world favor us, it is nothing. For to what end
was it Gods will that all his Angels should appear together at the publishing
of his law, but to teach us to be ashamed of our sins, and thereby to humble
us in good earnest, that we might seek all our welfare in our Lord Jesus
Christ? And moreover where as it is said that our Lord Jesus Christ was the
mediator of the Law: let us assure our selves that if we resort wholly to his
grace, we shall not need to fear that the law shall have any more power to
condemn us, yea or to reign over our sin. 1. Cor. 15. g. 56.
For we must bear in mind how S. Paul in the first to the Corinthians
says, that the law is the strength of sin, and does so sharpen sin as it
wounds us deadly. Seeing it is so then: surely if we had not the thing that
is showed us here for our comfort, we should be stricken with such fear, as
we could not be sure of our salvation, though the promises were offered us in
our Lord Jesus Christ. For we would always match the contrary things
against them, and lay the Law in balance with them, saying: What? was not the
Law given of God? But God condemns us by it. Therefore although our Lord
Jesus Christ step in too help the matter, yet doothe it not seem that we
be escaped. So shall we always be in trouble. But if we consider how our
Lord Jesus was the mediator in the publishing of the law: it shows unto us
that if he be our advocate at this day, it will be a good and sufficient
discharge for us: in so much that although God have pronounced his sentence of
cursing against us, yet we must not be dismayde at it, nor so ouerpressed with
hartgreefe and anguishe of mind, as though the mishiefe were incurable: but
assure our selves that our Lord Jesus Christ will very well agree too do
both twain, that is too wit, both make us ashamed that we may learn
humility, and therewithal also make us sure of our salvation. And therefore
let us learn, that whenever we be beaten down, there is none other means
too raise us up a^gayne, but too know that the self same person which was
ordained to be the mediator for the publishing of the law, is now manifested
unto us at this day with the same commission, and will make us too perceive it
by experience. Further let us mark that he is not a mediator for (...) one
nation alone, but for all the whole world, in as much as all of us are the
creatures of God. True it is that we were after a sort cut off from him by
the sin of Adam. But our Lord Jesus Christ is come too make up the breach
again that was both in heaven and in earth, Colos. 1. ^. 20.
as I have alleged already out of the first chapter to the Colossians. Seeing
it is so then, let us not doubt but that God accepts us as heirs of his
promise, in as much as he acknowledges us for the spiritual children of
Abraham. And although there be great diversity [betweene our days and] the
time of the ceremonies which served too separate the one from the other: yet
let not that hinder us from coming unto God. For why? God is one. Although
then that there be both Jews and Gentiles, although there be many diverse
Nations among men, although their languages be diverse, their manners and trades
of living contrary, and every of us has so much variety and inconstancy in
himself, that we have no hold of our selves: yet let us rest upon God, for he
is [alwayes] one. He has given us his law, he has given us his Gospel: and
let not us think that there is any contrariety in that case, but that all
agrees very well. Only let us suffer our selves to be ruled by him, that we
may come to our Lord Jesus Christ. And how may that be done? By being
clean rid from all pride, by being abashed and ashamed, by misliking of our
selves, and by perceiving that there is nothing in us but death. Then shall we
come too our Lord Jesus Christ, knowing that God the father accepts us, if
we hold that way. Why so? For he is always one: and his giving of the law
was not too disanull or impeache the promise that he had made before. Likewise
his revealing of his grace more fully unto us in his Gospel, was not for that
he wist not how to make his law of force toward us, and to put it to the right
use and purpose of it, that we might have a rule whereby to live well: but that
whereas we were accursed by it, we might know how there is none other
remedy for us, but by being blissed again in the seed that was promised
from time to time, in whose hand our welfare was stablished, that is to wit by
coming to our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the fountain and welspring of all
blissednesse.

Now let us fall down before the Majesty of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him too make us perceive them more and
more, so as we may mislike of them, and not only confess them with our mouth,
but also lay open our hearts before him, and submit our selves wholly to his
holy word, and that in such wise as we may be comforted by his free
goodness, as it is showed us in our Lord Jesus Christ, and he reform us also
by his holy spirit, too the end that whereas we of our selves be full of
rebelliousnesse, we may by his governing become teachable and ready to follow
his holy will, and to give our selves over all wholly unto him. And let us pray
unto him for all these things, saying: Almighty God heavenly father. etc.

The.xxij. Sermon, which is the eight upon the third Chapter.
21 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid. For if the law
were given too justify, truly ryghtuousnesse should come by the Law.

22 But the Scripture has shut up all under sin, to the intent that the
promise by the says of Jesus Christ should begiuen to those that believe.

23 Now before that faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up to
come to the faith that was to be revealed.

24 By means whereof the Law was our scholemaster to lead us unto Christ,
that we might be justified by faith.

25 But now that faith is come, we be no more under the Scholemaster.


WE have already this morning dispatched this point, that the Law was not
given in vain, though it could not bring us too righteousness to make us
acceptable to God. Secondly, it was showed you, that Gods giving of his Law,
was not to the intent we should seek our righteousness and salvation there,
as though his grace, had bin weak and insufficient: but for a far other
respect, that is to wit, to give men such knowledge of their sins, as they
might be ashamed of them in the^ selves: for otherwise they could not be
touched to the quick, to flee to our Lord Jesus Christ for refuge, as we see
too much. And now S. Paul moves another question: namely, whether the law
be against the promises. For surely when it is said that the law promises
us salvation, upon condition that we deserve it: and the promise of the
Gospel tells us that we shall be taken into Gods favor without any
deserving: a man would think there were some contrariety in the matter. As if
a man should offer me a house, so I would pay well for it, and did set me a
price of it: and another man should say unto me, no, thou shall have it for
nothing. There is great contrariety in these sayings. And it seems that in
speaking after that fashion, God vnsayeth that which he had spoken in his law,
where he says, Serve me, and keep my commandments, and you shall not miss
of your wages. For in the Gospel he speaks another language, saying, I
require nothing of you, for ye be so wretched that ye can give me nothing:
but I receive you into my kingdom frankly and of mine own free goodness
without any desert of yours: your heritage is assigned to you, even because it
is my good pleasure to do it. Heerevpon S. Paul declares, that although God
speak after another manner and fashion in the law than in the Gospel: yet
notwithstanding when we have well considered the mark that he shoots at [wee
shall perceyue] there is no contrariety in the matter. For (as I have told you
this morning) Gods promising of reward to our works is not to beguyle us, but
to stop our mouths that we might not repine against him, as we see that the
world does, which is always ready to carpe at him with devilish malapertnesse
when he handles them not after their own will and liking. God then cutteth
off all occasion of grudging, when he tells us that we shall not be
disappoynted of our wages for our well serving of him. Furthermore let every of
us examine him self well, and he shall find that that is not the match whereby
we must obtain salvation: for there is none of us all but he may condemn him
self by his own life, if he judge without flattering. But after that God has
spoken after that fashion, he offers us remedy in the Gospel, and tells
us that for as much as we be damned, and can not hope to attain any salvation
by our works: he him self offered it us of his own free goodness, because it
pleases him so to do. And for that cause S. Paul answers, If the law had
bin given to justify, I could well enough grant that righteousness should be
given us by it. But let us see whether God meant that or no. It is certain he
meant it not. Then sends he us to Gods purpose: as if he should say, that the
Hypocrites which are so puffed up with pride and ouerweening, that they think
they be able to justify them selves, and to win heaven, are il expounders of
Gods law, yea and falsifiers thereof. For men must always have an eye to the
intent of the speaker. Now God meant not to set men a gog with any trust in
their own wit and deseruings: for we be too much given to that of our own
nature. We see it has bin a common error through the whole world in all ages.
Therefore we need no scholing to persuade us that we be able folk, and that we
can bind God to us by our virtuous doings. But contrariwise God has given us
his law, to the intent we should be wounded with it as with a sword, and the
stripe be so deadly as we might be constrained to flee to him for succor.
Seeing then that Gods will it to slay us by the Law, it is not given us to make
us righteous. And therefore they that seek their life and welfare there,
beguile them selves: and there is no reason why they should allege for the^
selves, yea? how so? God has promised me it. No, but they must consider to
what end he says so. Now we see how S. Paul has discussed this question, that
there is no contrariety between the Law and the Gospel, though God alter the
manner of his speech at the first blush. Now he adds afterward, That the
Scripture has shut up all ^^^der sin, that we might obtain the promise by
the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. When he says that the scripture has
shut up all under sin, he shows that men are tootoo blockishe, too think
that God meant too assign them a due wages or hire, when he did set them down
this condition. He that does these things shall live in them. Let them
read the whole law, let them search the contents and substance of it, let
them look well upon the whole holy Scripture: and they shall find that it
accuses and condemns all men from the most to the least, without any
exception. Now if we be al condemned, even by the law: what would we more? Must
it not needs be that we be tootoo much blinded with hypocrisy, when we will
needs bind God to us after this sort, notwithstanding that we be far wide
from all righteousness, and he has told us that we can not compass it in
his sight, but that we must be utterly overwhelmed? S. Paul alleges not
here any text too show that the Scripture has shut up all under sin, but
takes it as utterly certain and which ought not to be doubted of any more
among the faithful. And for proof thereof we see, that even from the
creation of the world, we be all of us corrupted in Adam. His sin condemned
not him self only, but also all his whole offspring, and all of us are fallen
in that fall of his. Genesis 6. a. 5.
And thereupon it is said, that al our thoughts are rebellings against God, and
there is nothing but naughtiness in us. What then is man's wit? A warehouse of
all wickedness. And seeing that God has avouched it to be so at a word, what
shall we gain by chalenging this or that too our selves? For all our
startingholes shall but increase our misery, because that in so doing we spite
God, and kindle his wrath so much the more. For whereto served all the
sacrifices, but to show us to our faces, that all men are utterly accursed so
long as they continue in them? And although there were no sacrifices at all,
yet very experience shows it. Let every of us enter into himself, let him
consider what manner a one he is, and let him view himself in the perfection
which the holy scripture requires at our hands: and he shall well find that
there is no way for him but to embrace the promise of Gods mercy which he
makes unto us, Es. 43. c. 25
when he says that our iniquities shall be wiped out, and that there is no way
for us to come to him, but only by his love. And does he not hereby still
bewray our sin? specially seeing he sets down Jesus Christ for our
righteousness? But if any man list to have a larger and certener discourse
hereof, let him ad that which S. Paul sets down in the third to the Romans,
To. 3. b. 19.
where he sets forth the thing largely which is touched here briefly: and
then shall he see yet better how the scripture has shut up all under sin. For
there S. Paul alleges the texts that serve to bewray man's nature till Gods
have drawn him back, changed him, and fashioned him new again. Psa. 14. a. 1
Like as when he says that God looked down here bylowe, to see if he could
find any soundness, and all were corrupted, yea and festered in their
naughtiness, and there was not so much as one that sought after God. Now it
is certain that there, there is no speaking of two or three, but generally of
all men in whom God has not wrought to govern them by his holy spirit.
Therefore it is all one as if David did show us in a painted table, what manner
of ones we be by birth and heritage. Afterward he adds that which is
written in the fiftith Psalm, and in all the residue, Esa. 59. b. 8. etc. 16.
and finally alleges Esaias also, to show that God was feign to serve his
turn with his own arm, when he purposed to redeem men. What is it (says he)
that men have done in that behalf? For they do but run forward, and cast
themselves headlong intoo all cursednesse and transgression. They do but
wander: they love shifting, sutteltie, falshod, and lying: to be short, when
God had looked that men should have helped to bring themselves too salvation,
they were rather a hundred thousand times more in danger of perishing. S. Paul
therefore alleges all those things. Now let us flatter our selves as much
as we list: yet can not the things be called back which God has pronounced
upon us. And as often as we read the said textes, Romans 3.
and hear Saint Paul's expounding of them in the forealledged chapter: it is
for us too cast down our heads, and to receive the shame which we deserve:
namely to be berefte of all glory, and too seek at Gods hand the things that
we want. And thus ye see how the scripture has shut up all under sin. In
the eleventh chapter to the Romans he says that God has shut up all under
sin, To. 11. d. 32
too the intent to have mercy on all. But there he^^seth yet one step
higher. For he speaks not of the things that are told us in the law and the
prophets, but of Gods secret judgment, in that it was his will that all of us
should be as good as drowned in destruction, to the intent that there should
be no salvation but only by his goodness. Then if it be demanded why God has
suffered men to fall into so miserable plight: it is because he will have us
beholden to his only mercy for all things. Truly this will seem strange to
many fantastical persons, which would feign restrain God to their measure,
and are so rash that when Gods determinations pass beyond their fleshly
reason, by and by they condemn him for spiteful and cruel. Yet for all that,
S. Paul will have us too rest upon this saying, that God has shet up all
under sin, that is to say, that he could well have created us much stedfaster
and perfecter than he has done. He could have preserved us as he does his
Angels. He could have given us such constancy in the person of Adam, that we
should have entered into the heritage of heaven without dying. Yea and he
could have made that no mo should have fallen in the person of Adam, but Adam
alone. But he listed not so to do. If it be demanded why the mischief
spreaded out further: is it not because God would have it so? Therefore we must
in this case, as it were bridle and imprison ourselves, and receive the
doctrine in such wise as Saint Paul has uttered it: namely that God has
put us all under sin, to the intent we should resort to him for mercy. But
it is not enough that God has so determined it in his secret purpose: it was
requisite also that the determination should be published and known. For
until such time as men perceive themselves too be condemned: they will still
be weltring in some vain selftrust, and boast of themselves, as we see too
much. The Scripture therefore must be feign to bring us to this understanding,
that every of us may condemn himself for a sinner, as it were with his own
mouth, yea and that we do it unfeignedly. And why? Because it is by believing,
that we obtain the promis, that is to say the righteousness that is freely
promised us. To. 11. d. 32
In the said text of the eleventh to the Romans which I alleged even now,
Saint Paul says, to the intent to show mercy upon all: but here he shows
that it is not for all men to be partakers of it in general. For we know
that the greatest number perishes in their sins, because they refuse the
remedy that is offered them in the Gospel. And why then does Saint Paul
speak of all? It is as much as if he should say, there is none other help for
us but only Gods looking upon us with pity, of his own mere goodness, that
pardoning our offenses and receiving us into his favor, he take us for his
children, too bring us to the heritage of the kingdom of heaven. We see then
that Saint Paul did not without cause say that God will have mercy upon all:
not that every man is comprehended under that word all, but to exclude and put
away all selfrightuousnesse of man. Moreover we see how the mean is expressed
here: namely that we must obtain the promis by faith, John. 3. b. 16
according as Saint John says that God so loved the world, that he spared
not his only son, to the end that whosoever believes in him should not
perish but have life everlasting. Will we then enter into the treasure that
is showed to us here? Faith must be as a keye to open us the door. For God
calls us to it, but it is not enough for us too be called only: it behooves
us to answer according to this saying, you are my people: Esai. 25. b. 9
yea Lord, and thou art our God. When he says, (...). 63 b. 16
you are my children: let us answer, Lord we come to thee as to our father. But
surely we cannot answer so of our own proper motion: it must be given us of
the holy Ghost. Howbeit the question is not here whither faith come of men's
selves or no. Saint Paul does no more but declare that to be quit before God,
and to be drawn out of the dungeon of cursednesse wherein we are all of us
plunged, we must not bring any thing of our own, as though we would go about
to bind God, and that it were meet for us too imagine any desert of our own:
but come too crave his favor which is offered us freely without any duty to
usward, and settle our trust there, so as we hope not for any welfare otherwise
than because God shows himself merciful toward us. I have declared already
wherefore this serves. Surely men would always feign cloak themselves with
some presumptuousnesse, as we see that Adam did: who though his own sin
vpbrayded him, so as he was afraid of Gods majesty, did nevertheless seek
figleaues to cover himself withal. At the same point are we. Howbeit, it is
but a beguiling of ourselves too come before God, like whytelimed walls, and
to think to be accepted at his hand: for he has an eye to the soundness of
the heart, which is not to be found in any man. For so long as he lets us
alone in our own kind, we be naughtworth, how fair a show soever we make
too the worldward. Again, when he has reformed us, and given us a good desire
too walk in his fear, which thing all the faithful must needs have: it
does not follow therefore, that our affection is full and perfect: no, it
comes far short of it. And yet, that which we have, we hold of his mere
grace. So have we not any thing to glory of or to rest upon howsoever the world
go: we cannot ground ourselves upon our own deseruings. True it is that the
faithful must seek to give themselves wholly unto God: for we cannot be
members of our Lord Jesus Christ, except we be sanctified by his holy spirit,
as we shall see in time and place hereafter. And our Lord Jesus Christ cannot
be divided nor cut in pieces as infinite as he is. Although our sins be
forgiven us by his death and passion, and washed away and clenzed by his blood,
and that the same washing be given us to fashion again the image of God his
father in us, so that we must be made new creatures in him: yet
notwithstanding howsoever we fare, it is not for us too preace boldly before
God, as though we were worthy to be received, or as though we brought him any
thing wherewith to bind him. For if we presume to allege one thing or other
to him, first and foremost all that we have comes of him. Again on the
otherside we be convicted of a hundred thousand faults, and when we go about
any good work, we shall no sooner have done it, but it shall be infected with
some spot or other, so that if it be tried rigorously, it shall always be
subject to condemnation. Then must we needs keep our mouths shut: so that if
we will have God favorable and merciful to us, we must bring nothing with us
but only faith, no, but only faith. Nevertheless it is not meant that every
man should take the bridle in his neck too do evil (as I have declared
already heretofore:) it is not meant that we should be void of Gods
spirit, nor that we should welter in all wickedness: no, but here the case
concerns only our trust whereupon we may ground ourselves too call GOD
our father, that we may be sure of the eternal heritage. If we go to our own
works (as has bin declared before) there will be no certeintie at all. For why,
it is not a work or twain, or three that is required, but a perfect
obedience, which was never yet found in any mortal creature. Truly if the
Angels should come to account before God, they could not answer to that
perfection of righteousness: and much less were it possible that we which are
but worms, and which suck up sin as a fish does water, Job. 14. d. 18. and.
15. b. 6.
(as Job says) should be so sound that God should receive us for our
worthiness. To be short, we must quite and clean give over the trust of our
own works, and acknowledge that there is nothing but condemnation in us, if we
mind to have the promis performed toward us. Thus ye see in effect what Saint
Paul meant too declare in this text. And now he adds immediately, that before
faith came, we were kept under the law, and as it were shet up till the faith
was reveled. Here the words Law and Faith would be somewhat darksome, if they
were not opened more at large. For sometimes when the scripture speaks of
faith, it meeneth all religion, and comprehends all the instructions that are
given us in Gods book. Sometimes it meeneth the certeintie of belief which we
ought too have when we come to pray unto God, because we may not step to him
at al adventure, but accept the grace that he offers us. Then in as much as
Gods promises depends not upon our deserts, but is altogether freely and
frankly given unto us, and we are made partakers by our Lord Jesus Christ: if
we embrace the same, our so doing is called faith, and so has Saint Paul
taken it hitherto, and likewise in his Epistle to the Romans, and in all other
places where he discourses or treats how we may be justified before God, or
how we may come in his favor, for they be both one thing, as I have said
before. But in this text the word Faith has yet a more peculiar signification,
which is, the revelation [or discouerie] which we have by the Gospel. For it
is very certain that the forefathers had the spirit of faith or belief,
according as I have showed you already that Abraham was justified because he
believed God, and that we also must be fashioned like to his example in that
behalf, as whereby we be made his children to come to the kingdom of heaven.
Then had faith his full strength at all times, and there never was any other
means to set God and men at one: but yet was not the faith reveled in Abraham's
time, because our Lord Jesus Christ who is the very pledge and substance
thereof, was not yet come intoo the world. Thus ye see how we be justified
freely at this day, and without any desert of our own. And why is that? For he
that believes that Jesus Christ died for our sins, and is risen again for
our justification: To. 10. b. 10
has all the whole. And as it is said in another place, our believing with our
heart makes us ryghtuouse, and our confessing with our mouth makes us safe.
But now had Abraham had our Lord Jesus Christ discovered unto him as we have
him at this day, (in so much that he is as good as crucified among us as Saint
Paul has said heretofore:) his faith had bin all one with ours. But it was
yet after a sort ouercouered, that is to say, although Abraham trusted in Jesus
Christ, hoping for salvation at his hand, and although he utterly distrusted
himself, knowing that there was virtue in him that might go for payment before
God: yet was he hild still under shadows, and was feign to look at Jesus
Christ a far off. For he was not yet named the day sun of rightuousenesse, as
he is called in Malachie. Malach. 4. a. 2.
Now then we see what Saint Paul meant by saying that faith was not yet come
namely that the convenient time of the reueling of it to the world as it is
nowadayes by the Gospel, was not yet come, so that the fathers were shet up
under the law. So therefore, here is some piece of difference, and some piece
of likeness: in so much that if it be demanded what the state of the fathers
were that lived under the law: it is to be answered, that partly it differed
from ours, and partly was al one. How were they both one? In this, that God had
showed himself merciful to our father, howbeit for our Lord Jesus Christ's
sake: and that Abraham perceiving how it stood him on hand to put his whole
trust in the mere grace of God, gave over himself, and so his believing was
reckened to him for righteousness, as we have seen before. In like case was it
with all the Patriarks and Prophets. So then their taking was all one with
ours, in that they grounded themselves upon our Lord Jesus Christ, and boasted
not of any thing save only Gods mercy, and had the promises of the inheritance
of the heavenly life, as we have. Yet was there also a diversity, because they
were feign to have Sacrifises, washings, and such other like things, till the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. And when the law was given, so as there was a
Priest that entered into the Sanctuary to be an intercessor, and the people
stood aloof a great way of, and a veyle or Curtayne was drawn in the mids
of the Tabernacle to make a darkening of things: ye see they were things
wherein the state of the fathers differed from ours: for during the absence of
our Lord Jesus Christ, they had Ceremonies and figures, whereas we have the
very body and substance of them, Colo. 2. c. 17
as says S. Paul to the Colossians. For God bids not us to offer any mo
Calves, Sheep, or Oxem to wipe out the spots of our sins. But he tells us
that we must be sprinkled with the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, through the
power of the holy Ghost, and that in our Lord Jesus Christ we shall find all
that is requisite for our salvation. Ye see the^ that as now faith reigns in
full power: that is to say, whereas the fathers had but a little taste of it
according to their mesure: it is fully and openly reveled unto us. And for this
cause S. Paul says, that the fathers were after a sort restreined or shut up:
so that he likeneth the law to a bondage, and in very deed so was it, and he
will hereafter show what manner of bondage it is. It is not meant that the
fathers obtained not the everlasting life which we hope for, or that we shall
not be crowned all together at the last day: but that God was fain for a time
to weeld the^ like little babes. And for that cause also does he use the
similitude of a scholemaster, and will again set down a third similitude of
Tutors and gouerners. Howbeit for as much as this shall be handled in his due
place, let it suffice us as now to understand, that whereas S. Paul likeneth
the law unto a bondage, it is to show far greater favor to us, tha^ he did to
the fathers that died before the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, because he
uses us now after a freer fashion. And the second similitude does yet better
express that the Jews were as children, and we now are as me^ growe^. For
this word Scolemaster betokens a master of children, he says the^ that the
law executed the office of a Scolemaster, to train up the childhood of the
people in old time. And hereupon it may be concluded, that the faithful which
believed in Jesus Christ before he was manifested to the world, were Gods
children as well as we. And if they were children, then were they also heirs.
Herin we see that we must not make the^ like brute beasts, as some fantastical
heads do, which think that the Jews contented themselves with the possession
of the plentiful land that was promised the^, and cared for no more but to be
well nurrished and sed there: for that is too cursed a blasphemy. But Jesus
Christ serves not to fill men's bellies and to feed their paunches: he serves
to bring us to the heavenly life. John. 8. g. 56
It is said that Abraham saw his day: that then was the thing whereon he rested
his conscience. And we see how David did always look up higher tha^ the
world: and Jacob at his death eue^ though he was giving up the last gasp, Ge.
49. c. 12.
and looked not to live any longer in the world, said he would trust in the
salvation of God. The ancient fathers the^ were not little children after such
a sort, that they were not marked with Gods holy spirit, nor called by him to
the inheritance of the endless life: but only in the measure of faith, which
was the difference between the^ and us. And how was that? Eue^ because the law
which they had was yet wrapped in figures and shadows: whereas now Jesus
Christ leads us right forth to heaven. And whereas I said that they were
inferior to us in the measure of faith: I meene not that Abraham, David, and
other like had a weaker faith tha^ we: for seek we never so narowly through
the whole world, it is not to be presumed that any one creature is to be found
at this day, which has the hundredth part of the faith of Abraham or David. And
the excellency of their faith appears in this, that although they had not
the promises so apparent as we have, but very darkly, yet notwithstanding they
ouerdame all such temptations as would have overthrown us a hundred thousand
times. If any of us were put to the enduring of the incou^ters of Abraham or
David, what would become of us? Ge. 21. c. 25.
For Abraham was a wayfarer al his life long in a strange country, where me^
grudged him water to drink, though he himself dug the wells. He was put
to as many plunges as could be. Finally God exercised him in so many
incou^ters, that he seemed to be minded to throw him into the bottom of hell: and
yet nevertheless his faith abides still vnva^quished. As touching David, he
was driven a long time from place to place. Being hunted out of the whole
realm and having no succor to retire unto, but (...) among the infidels and
enemies of God, or else into dens and among wyld beasts: he was moreover put
to such reproach, that every man cursed him as the veriest villayne and kaytif
in the world: and yet for all that, he hild out still, he called still upon
God, and he never fell to any murmuring or blaspheming, but rather glorified
God in those his extremities and distresses. So then we see that their faith
ought to make us all ashamed. And when every of us shall have looked well into
his own conscience, we shall find that we scarsly have any little piece of
the faith that they had. But the greatness of their faith must not be measured
here by the constancy and ableness that every of them had to trust in God.
Whereby then? By the outward object of their faith. As for example: Although
Esaias was an excellent teacher, so that his like is not to be found in the
world: yet the least preacher that sets forth the Gospel purely, shall be
preferred before Esaias, Math. 11. b. 11.
as is avouched by the mouth of our Lord Jesus Christ himself. And why is
that? Because that although Esaias was as an Angel, and spoke with such
authority yea, and majesty, as were able to touch the hearts to the quick
which are most fallen aslepe in this world, in so much that even God himself
seems to have opened his own holy mouth in him, and his words were not as
the words of a mortal man: yet did he hold but the manner of teaching that was
convenient for that time: that is to say he did set forth the la^d of Chanaan
as a pledge to those whom he taught, and keep them to the Sacrifises,
washings, figures, shadows, and al other like things, whervnder he showed what
the happiness of gods children is. Esai. 54. c. 11. and. 60. c. 17.
As for example, we see how he likeneth the church to a palace builded of gold
and silver and preciouse stones. Ye see then that his manner of dealing was
fashioned unto the darkness of the law. But now our Lord Jesus Christ is set
forth unto us, although a simple man preach the Gospel, which has another great
eloquence nor authority: yet shall he as it were point at Jesus Christ with
his fingar, he shall show us how we be in the time of fullness, and therwithall
he shall assure us that our sins are forgiven us in the death and passion of
our Lord Jesus Christ, in so much that Gods wrath is pacified, and victory
obtained for us over death. Thus ye see that the diversity is (...). doctrine,
and not in the quality of the faith as it is in every man's heart. For although
Abraham had a wonderful faith, and such a one as we shall not find nowadayes
in the world: yet was it always hemmed in with the said Ceremonies and
shadows. David was an Angel and myrror of all perfection: and yet for all
that, he was feign to be subject to the same order that the common people were,
and to use all the Ceremonies that were then in use, and his looking at Jesus
Christ was but a far off, because there was the said Curtain before him,
which let him that he could not behold his glory as it is showed us
nowadayes in the Gospel. And although we know not the hundredth part of the
things that were disclozed to David and Abraham, to make them invincible
against all temptations, and to make them fight so manfully that god might be
glorified in them, and to make them bear out all brunts: yet had they not that
which we have: that is to wit, they had not the pledge Jesus Christ delivered
unto them, as we have, to the end we might call upon God his father, because
we be members of his body, and he is our head, assuring our selves that he
and we are all one, with condition that his goods become ours, and that we
have full inioyment of them at this day. Thus ye see that our faith is greater
than Abraham's was, not in respect of our persons, nor yet in respect of any
steadfastness and firmness that is in us: but in respect of the doctrine or
teaching of it, which we term the object of faith, that is too say, the thing
that is set before us from without. And so ye see why Saint Paul says that
the fathers were hilde in ward as it were under a Schoolemayster, till the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Math. 13. b. 16.
Now we for our part have cause too magnify Gods goodness, according also as
our Lord Jesus Christ exhorts us, saying: blessed are the eyes which see
that which you see, and the ears which hear that which you hear. For many
Kings and Prophets have desired the like, Iam. 2. d. 23.
and have gone without it. Behold, Abraham was called Gods friend. Behold,
David is reported too have bin found according too Gods own heart: Act. 13.
c. 22
and yet for all that, he was feign too look aloof at the promises which are
now as it were cast into our lappes, and whereof we have our fill. They sought
Jesus Christ then absent and hidden, and they waited for him. But now that our
Lord Jesus Christ has come down into the world and bin conversant here, he
has given us a sure warrant that all is performed as he himself declared at
his death. John. 19. c. 30.
What a lewdness then is it, if we nowadayes be not much the more inflamed
and quickened up to follow the promises of the Gospel, where God
communicates himself so familiarly unto us? So then on the one side we have
cause too yield unto God his deserved praise, for that he has vouchsafed to
exalt us, I say us miserable creatures to so high dignity, as to prefer us
before all the holy kings and Patriarchs that lived under the Law. Howbeit
heerewithall let us take good heed, that this benefit and prerogative turn
not to our double comdemnation for our unthankfulness in not making account of
so great a good turn so offered unto us. Now although Abraham were still
hilde under after the manner of a child (as I have said already:) yet forsook
he both his kinsfolk and native Country, and went as a poor wayfayrer into a
strange land, where he was hunted and tossed from post to pillar in
continual languishing. And if he had repented him, could he not have returned
into his own Country again? Yes: but the Apostle in the eleventh to the
Hebrews tells us, that he had such a trustfulnesse and so constant a faith,
that he hilde out even to the last push: insomuch that he showed by effect,
that his mind was wholly set upon the kingdowme of heaven, and not entangled
with this world: and yet notwithstanding, for all that both he and the rest
of the holy fathers walked after that manner before us: yet tarry they still for
us at this day, and received not the promises which are manifested to us in the
Gospel. For while they lived they had but a small taste of that which is
reveled to us nowadayes, and which is laid open before us. VVo be to us
therefore if we be not warned and inflamed to receive Gods offer, when he
utters the infinite riches of his goodness, to win us and to draw us in
such wise from this world, as we may come to yield our selves freely unto
him. Then if such gracious dealing move us not too come unto him, now that
we be men grown, notwithstanding our rawnesse and infirmity, and too
take the yoke which he lays upon us, and too suffer him too govern us
under his obedience, yea and too take courage and stoutnesse too us to defye
Satan, and the whole world, and all the allurements thereof: say if we
ouermayster not all these conflictes: surely we shall pay right dearly for
the grace that is offered us in the Gospel. And therefore let every of us
bestyrre himself, and take opportunity while God allureth us, and while the
time of salvation, and day of favor is present. And seeing we be so feeble
that we do but dragge our legs after us, let us pray God too strengthen
us, and too redress our lazynesse and coldenesse. Also let every of us
streyne and enforce himself: and sithe we be so hemmed in with the snares
that Satan has laid for us, let us walk so much the more in the fear of
God, that we may overcome all Satan's lettes and wyles, and go forward in the
way that God has set us in, and follow the fathers that are gone before us,
which tarry still for our company, that we might be gathered up all together
intoo the heavenly life, at the blessed coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Now let us fall down before the Majesty of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him that we may so mislyke of them,
as we may not only be sorye and seek forgyuenesse of them, but also be
renewed by true repentance, and go forward and be confyrmed in it more and
more, till we be clean rid of all vices, and be so fashioned like too his
Image, as his glory may shine forth in us, even till we enter into the full
possession of the inheritance that he has promised us. That it may please him
to grant this grace, not only to us, but also to all people. etc.

The. 23. Sermon, which is the ninth upon the third Chapter.
26 For all of you are Gods children through the faith which is in Jesus
Christ.

27 Surely as many of you as are baptized, have put on Christ.

28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there
is neither male nor female: For year all one in Jesus Christ.

29 Now if ye be Christ's, the^ are you Abraham's seed, and heirs according to
the promise.


WE have seen heretofore to what dignity we be advanced by the Gospel. For
not only we be called to be of the fellowship and company of the holy fathers
whom God honored so highly: but also our state is yet more worthy and noble,
because we be delivered from the bondage of the Law, whervnder they were
hilde. And for the better confirming of this doctrine, S. Paul adds that we
be al made the children of God by believing in our Lord Jesus Christ, John. 1.
b. 12
according also as it is said in the first Chapter of S. John's Gospel. For
there this dignity is commended to us as it deserves: namely, that we have
preeminence and prerogative to be counted. Gods children through faith, verily
for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake, who is his only and natural son. For that
title belongs alonely to him by right, and is communicated to us but only by
grace, inasmuch as God has voutsafed to adopt us for his sake. So the^ Jesus
Christ is the head of the Church: howbeit for his sake god acknowledges and
auoweth us for his children. And here we see that the word Belief imports
more tha^ me^ commonly take it to do, according also as I have declared before.
For they that are not exercized in the holy Scripture, think it strange that
God should honor us so highly for believing, and (to their seeming) faith is
not so great a virtue that it ought to obteyn so great a benefit. But I have
showed you heretofore, that our believing in Jesus Christ is not as the
crediting of some story when we hear it or read it, but a receiving and
conceyuing of him inwardly with full assuredness as he is offered us by God
his father. Therefore when we embrace our Lord Jesus Christ, as the party
that has made amends for our sins too reconcyle us too God, so as we
repose the whole trust of our welfare in him, not doubting but that he has
brought us all that is for the inheriting of heaven: I say if we be once
assured of that: it is no marvel though God acknowledge us as his children for
our beleefes sake. Howbeeit therewithal we must call to our remembrance, what
we have discoursed before: namely that this [benefite of God in acknowledging
us to be his children] comes not of any desert of faith, neither must we
wey it here in the balance what manner of virtue it is: for we be made Gods
children by free adoption. If a man demand the cause: I answer, that the
very well spring and foundation is not too be sought elsewhere than in Gods
only goodness, inasmuche as it pleased him too pity us. Nevertheless it is
brought to pass by the means of faith (as I have said already,) because
that being rid of all fond ouerweening, and acknowledging our selves to be
damned in our own nature, we flee for refuge to our Lord Jesus Christ. Thus
you see in effect what S. Paul meant to say. And he goes on still with the
matter, to the end we should know, that only faith ought to suffice us to
the atteyning of salvation, without seeking any other means one way or other
too help us. What should we desire more than that God should acknowledge
us for his children? Will we needs have an overplus added too so inestimable
a benefit? Ye see then that our full felicity and perfect glory, is that we
have leave to call upon God as our father, not doubting but that seeing he
has received us into his favor, he will also handle us as his own children.
But how shall we come by that? Saint Paul says it is only faith that makes
us parttakers of that dignity. Then let us conclude, that the Law can nothing
advantage us, or else it must needs be that we be wonderful covetous,
yea and as good as out of our wits, to desire more than too be the children of
God. Job. 1. b. 6.
The Angels are greatly honored in the holy Scripture, and yet the chief
title that is given them, is that they be the children of God. Now seeing that
we, we (I say) poor worms of the earth, in whom there is nothing but
filthynesse, no nor aught but corruption of sin, be matched with the
Angels, insomuch that God opens us the kingdom of heaven, and intends
too have us fellows with them, who be virtues and are nere about him, seeing
(I say) that we be made partakers of that glory: shall we be so presumptuous
to seek I wot not what moreover? Truly it is not only faith that makes us
to obtain that benefit. Wherefore let us learn to renounce all other
means that may be set before us: for when men offer us any other helps as
though the faith that we have in him were not sufficient, it is but a turning
of us away from our Lord Jesus Christ. That then is Saint Paul's meaning. But
we shall never conceive the fruit that is contained in this text, except we
always bear in mind, that by this word Faith S. Paul means to exclude
all the desert and worthiness that men suppose or imagine themselves able to
bring with the^ unto God. When they will needs go through with the matter by
their own power and virtues: It is all one as if they would cut off a piece of
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. But he cannot be rent in pieces or divided.
Therefore all the working of our salvation must come of him alone, and we must
not skulk here and there, nor seek bywayes, but come right forth unto him by
the streyte way of faith. Hereupon S. Paul adds, that being baptized in
Jesus Christ, we have put him on. And this is too take away a doubt that might
be cast here, namely how it is possible that we should become the children of
God, seeing that that dignity is peculiar to our Lord Jesus Christ. Heb. 1.
d. 15
For whereas he is called the Son of God, the Apostle shows that that title
cannot be verified of the very Angels of heaven. True it is, (as I have said
heretofore) that they be named the children of God: howbeeit, that is not
without an addition. So is it out of doubt, that there is not any creature to
whom that dignity belongs. But now seeing that Jesus Christ is the only
son of God, how does the same extend unto us? S. Paul declares that it
is by reason of the union that is betwixt him and us, John. 17. d. 32.
according as it is said in the.xvij. Chapter of. S. John. Then if we were not
one with our Lord Jesus Christ, surely we should have none acquaintance at
all with God: for we be quite cut off from all hope of life by sin. Yea and
we must needs be as deadly enemies unto him, and he unto us, till he have
altered and renewed us. Howsoever the world go, being separated from Jesus
Christ, and considered in our own nature, we be unworthy too be called men,
and therefore much less can we boast that God is our father. But here (as I
said) Saint Paul intended to assoyle that question, saying that by Baptism
we be clothed with our Lord Jesus Christ. And this similitude of clothing is
very ryfe in the holy Scripture, and it betokens in effect, that Jesus
Christ is our apparel or raiment, whereby all is covered and buried that might
make us to be rejected at Gods hand, and grace is purchased unto us, so as he
does not any more sift us and search us in our selves, but accepts us as if
we came in the very person of his own Son. To be short, Saint Paul meant to
show here the union that is between our Lord Jesus Christ and all the
faithful, which are the members of his body. And like as all the substance of
a tree comes from the root, and all the powers and abilities of a natural
body come from the head: even so is it between the son of God and us. For
(as I have said already) we have not so much as one drop of the heavenly life,
but of his inspyring or breathing into us. Therefore if we will come unto God,
and be partakers of the holy Ghost, and of the gifts that belong to the
endless life: let us be in Jesus Christ, and not think our selves to be any
thing or aught worth of our selves. And for the same cause, our Lord Jesus
Christ in the said text which I alleged out of the xvij. of S. John, setting
out the true and perfect happiness of his, fayeth: Father I pray thee that
they may be made one with us. Ye see then that the way for us to get out of
the dungeon of death wherein we were drowned, is to be united to our Lord Jesus
Christ by the bond of faith. Now S. Paul says, that that is done in Baptism.
Not that all they which are baptized are true members of Jesus Christ in deed:
for we see the clean contrary, insomuch that there are some which unhallow
and defile all the holiness of Baptism, and are guilty of high treason too
God, because that whereas they profess to hold of Jesus Christ, they despyze
and spyte him, and are as dung and filthiness too mar all things. Baptism
then makes us not all Christians, and again we know, that too be made the
child of God, is too great a benefit to be fathered upon a corruptible
Element. What is the water? Too say that the water begets or regenerateth
us again, and that thereby we be delivered from death, and obtain the glory
wherein God lyfteth us up too himself: as (say I) a perverting of all order.

But first of all let us mark here, that when Saint Paul speaks of
Baptism, he presupposes that we receive the thing that is offered unto us in
it. Many that are baptized do wype away the grace of God: and notwithstanding
that it be offered them, yet they make themselves unworthy of it through their
unbelief, lewdness, and rebellion. Thus ye see that the power of baptism is
disfeated in many men. But when there happens a mutual agreement and melody
between God and us: then has baptism the effect whereof S. Paul treats and
discourses in this text. And so the thing that makes us Gods children and
clothed us with Jesus Christ, is that God draws us out of the corruption
wherein we were by nature, and will have Jesus Christ to be our head, and us
ingraffed into him to be parttakers of his goods. Therefore look when we
receive that, then is all accomplished that is figured by baptism. If
hypocrites brag of their baptism, Gal. 6. b. 16
S. Paul shows them that it is but vanity and illusion, saying that the
circumcision of the letter is nothing: that is to say, if we look no further
but to the outward and visible Sacrament, it is all of no value. Even so is it
with baptism: it shall stand them in no sted which with their mouths vaunt
themselves to be Christians and great pillars of the Church, forasmuch as they
defile the thing which God had dedicated to so excellent an use, as I have told
you before. Then let us mark well that S. Paul speaks this sentence, not to
all without exception, which bear the sign and mark [of baptisme] outwardly:
but to such as fare the better by their baptism. Again S. Paul meeneth not
that baptism, that is to say the water has the power to change us in such
wise, that we should be clothed with our Lord Jesus Christ: for by that means
God should be robbed of the praise that is due to himself alone. But he shows
here the mean whereby we be certified that we be the members of our Lord Jesus
Christ's body. I have told you alredie, that we must not seek any other cause
of it than Gods mere goodness: for if we fetch windlasses one where or other,
it is like as if a man were a thirst, and would turn his back to the fountain
[to seek water.] Therefore let us learn, that it is only God which knitteth us
to our Lord Jesus Christ, of his own mere goodness, and that he does it by the
secret power of his holy spirit, and yet notwithstanding ceasseth not too
work by baptism as by an inferior instrument, according as we see how all
light comes of him, in so much that there was light in the world, even before
there was either Sun or Moon. And yet nevertheless God has stablished the
Sun whereby we have light here bylowe even unto this day. But yet does not
the Sun serve too diminish the power that is in God alone. Again it is said
that man lives not by bread only, Deuteronomy. 8. a. 3
but by every word that proceeds out of Gods mouth. And in good sooth the
bread it self is a dead thing. Who gives it us? It is God that inspireth
life into us: for we live in him as S. Paul says in the.xvij. of the Acts.
Act. 17. f. 28.
And yet notwithstanding it is his will too do it by bread, and he applies it
daily too our use, too the intent we should be fed with it. So then there is
none inconvenience that we should be clothed with our Lord Jesus Christ by
baptism, and yet notwithstanding that the same should proceed of Gods mere
grace, and that it should be done by the secret working of the holy Ghost,
surmounting the whole order of nature, whereof baptism does certify us,
because we be rude and earthly. God therefore is feign too draw by little and
little by reason of our infirmity, too make us too conceive the things that
otherwise are too high for us. For where are our wings too stie with above the
heavens? We have much a do to creep here beneath upon the earth, and
therefore God is feign too come down to us, which thing he does by his
Sacraments. Thus are we clothed with our Lord Jesus Christ by baptism,
according also as S. Paul she weth by another similitude in the sixth to the
Romans. Romans 6. a. 5.
For he says that we be greffed into the death and passion of our Lord Jesus
Christ, too the end also to be made partakers of his resurrection and life.
This similitude of greffyng is as fit as the other of clothing. For take me
the syen of a tree, and cut me of the head, or some bough of another tree, and
greffe me that little syen into it, that was taken from another, and ye see
they grow both into one, so as they become both one substance, and the root
yields his sap too the little sprig that was taken from another tree. Even
after the same manner are we greffed intoo our Lord Jesus Christ (says S.
Paul) and that is too the end that our old man should be crucified in him, and
we be raised up again in newness of life. But here we have first too mark,
how gracious and bountiful God has and still does show himself toward us,
in that it pleases him too unite us too his own son: for that passes all
the benefits which we can conceive in our imaginacion. And therefore also
does S. Paul prove, that all things which God has, do belong unto us, Romans 8.
f. 31.
and that we have the inioying of them, when we once possess his Son. Seeing
(says he) that God has not spared his own Son, how should he not give us
all things with him. Too be short, God could not have uttered the infinite
treasures better, than by joining us after that manner to his only Son. It is
more than if he had given us heaven and earth: For surely if we compare Jesus
Christ with all the goods of the world, yea and all the goods that are above
the earthly world: he far surmounteth them all. Mark that for one point.
Furthermore let us understand that God has so united us to our Lord Jesus
Christ, as we must be feign to have all our life in him. And it serves to
humble us the better, and to make us perceive how horrible a thing it is to be
wrapped in the cursednesse of Adam. For if the holy Scripture told us not that
we must be united to our Lord Jesus Christ, before we can be in Gods
favor: we should not feel sufficiently the wretchedness wherein we be hild
by nature, another should we hate our sins so much as we ought to do. But now
that it is told us how it is impossible, (yea though all the Angels should
come to our aid, and that all the world should help forward the matter): and
too be short, that although nothing wanted yet it were impossible for us to
come near unto God, or that he should look upon us with a fatherly
countenance, yea or that he should acknowledge us for his creatures, til we be
clothed with our Lord Jesus Christ: This were enough to make us abhor our
selves. And needs must it be that we be worse than lothely, seeing there is
none other means to appease Gods wrath toward us, and to set us again in his
favor, than by his covering of our sins, and by his clenzing of us from al
our filthiness and infection, by blotting out all our wickedness: and that
the same must be done by clothing our selves with Jesus Christ, according to
the figure thereof which we fee in Jacob, Genesis 27. d. 27.
when God blissed him by the hand and mean of his father. True it is that
Jacob was ch^^en as Jacob: but yet was he feign to be appareled as Esau. So was
he himself as in respect of Gods calling of him to the heritage or birthright:
and he was another man in respect of his borrowing of his brothers clothing.
Even so come we also as chozen of God and as having his promis, whereby he
assures us that he is ready to receive us to mercy: but yet must we first and
formest be clothed with our Lord Jesus Christ. For if we appear in our own
likeness, God must needs hate and abhor us as we be worthy. That is the
thing whereof we be warned. But in the mean while let us fare the better by
the warrant that is given us in baptim, that we may be able to fight against all the temptations and distrustes which Satan sets before our eyes to shake our
faith withal. If we be blockish so as we perceive not our own vices, but be
as it were rotten in them, woe be to us. But if we be wakened, to bethink our
selves what it is to make account before god, so as it comes evening and
morning to our remembrance, that he is the judge of the world and cannot give
up his office: if we enter into our selves to make examinacio^ of our sins:
surely we must needs be afraid and as it were besides our selves: and if we
had no help to relieve us, we should needs be drowned in despair. But let us
have our recourse to our baptim, and assure our selves that it is not for
naught that God has called us to be partakers of the pureness of his only
son, and made us al one with him: and then shall his bloodshed have such
effect to clenze us from all our spots, as we may come before God with our
heads upright: not with such loftiness as hipocrites have, which presume upon
themselves: but upon trust of his inestimable goodness, in as much as he has
told us that all things which belong to our Lord Jesus Christ are common to
us. Again if we perceive our selves to have committed so many offenses that
Gods wrath is kindled against us: behold, Jesus Christ has offered a
sacrifice, whereby we know that the atonement is made between God and us.
Seeing then that God has so testified his love toward us: let us not mistrust
but that he will prevent us when so ever we seek him in true faith, that is
too say, with such steadfastness as we doubt not that he meant too disappoynt
us when he pretended too be so liberal toward us. Thus ye see that the
way too make our baptism auaylable to us, is too use it as a sheeld too beat
back all the distrustes that come upon us too stop us from praying unto
God, and from having our whole recourse unto him, if we went not unto him,
[saying thus in our selues]: Surely it is true that I have such store of sins
in me, as the number of them were able too make God too loathe me: but
therefore I will not go too him in mine own person: I renounce my self and
mine own nature, as wherein there is nothing but shame and confuzion: and I go
to him in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, yea and he goes before me, he
gives me as it were his garment, he speaks for me, and in his name do I
present my self as though I were very he, because it has pleased him to be
so gracious too me as to make me all one with him. Thus ye see that we must
leave our selves behind us when we come before God, and we must take upon us
the person of our Lord Jesus Christ, yea we leave our selves behind us. Not
that we should not perceive our own misdoings and be rightly humbled and sorry
for them: but [that we should do the clean contrary, and] yet
notwithstanding take it for a full and resolute certainty, that God accepts
us when we come unto him as in the person of his only Son. But there are
very few that think upon this. And in good sooth, although that all of us
profess the Gospel, yet we shall find a number that know not the true use
of baptism, nor wheretoo it avails, nor to what end it was ordained. But
such folk shall pay deerly for taking such a pledge at Gods hand. He will
show that it is to costly a thing too be abused, for as much as it is said to
be the mean whereby we be united to our Lord Jesus Christ, and ingreffed into
his death and resurrection. Then whereas many have receyed baptism in their
childhood, and have lived a forty or fifty years in the world without
knowing too what end they were baptized: it were better for them that they had
bin borne dead, and too have bin sunken a hundred times into the earth, than
too have unhallowed so holy a thing. And therefore let us bethink our selves
the better, and learn that although there be but a little water cast upon
our heads, yet notwithstanding it is not a vain figure: for God speaks in it
as it were from heaven, and Jesus Christ is there present as a witness of the
usage and operation of the sacrament, and specially his death and resurrection
are warranted too us by it. Let us think well upon these things, and consider
too what end we be baptized and what benefit it brings us: let it be well
rooted in our hearts, and when soever any young children are baptized, let us
bethink our selves the better: For to what end is baptism solemnized in the
company [or congregacion] of the faithful? Truly to the end that the babe
should be commended unto God. Again it is a certain infraunchizing of him
into the heavenly City, and therefore it must not be done in hudther
mudther: but it is so excellent a deed, as ought to be done after a more
orderly and solemn fashion, than any thing belonging to worldly policy. For
therein we have a mirror of the benefit that was bestowed upon us before,
to the intent we should joy in it to the end. But we see that the unbelievers
do through their own unthankfulness deprive themselves of this adoption of
Gods, and quite banish themselves from it. To the end then that we may be
confirmed more and more, we must consider well, that when baptism is
celebrated, it touches us very nearly, and God calls us to him, too show
us in another bodies person, that we our selves are forlorn and damned by
nature. Howbeit for as much as he has knit us into the body of our Lord Jesus
Christ, we be no more considered in our own kind, another does God look what
we be of our selves, nor what we have deserved: but accepts us as if Jesus
Christ were in us, as in deed we must not be separated from him. This in
effect is it that we have too consider upon this text. Now hereupon S. Paul
concludes, that there is another Greek nor Jew bond nor free, male nor female,
but that Jesus Christ is one in us all, and all we are one in him. And by this
sentence S. Paul meant to express yet better, that only faith ought to suffyze
us, and that we must exclude all other means: for else it were a derogacion as
well to the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, as to the working of his holy
spirit. If any man allege that circumcision was always a record too the
fathers, of the same thing that we have at this day in baptism: the doubt is
assoyled in the second too the Colossians, Coloss 2. b. 11.
where S. Paul says that in being baptized we be circumcized: [howbeit]
not with man's hand, nor with visible circumcision: but that it ought to suffize
us that God acknowledges us to be partakers of the spiritual circumcision,
namely for so much as baptism is ordained too the same end now adays. And let
us mark, that circumcizion served to put a difference between the Jews and
the Gentiles. It was (as the Scripture terms it) a wall betwixt them, too
fence in the Jews as the people whom God had chozen. Ephesians. 2. c. 14
But now the blissing is published euerywhere, so as there is no more
diversity. Now then baptism being in these days succeeded in the place of
circumcision, supplieth the want of that old sign, which was a figure and
shadow of things too come. And that should not needed too have bin, if our
Lord Jesus Christ had not bin away. But now that he is manifested unto us* we
have baptism ordained in stead of it. Notwithstanding let us mark (as I have
said already) that we ca^ bring nothing of our own wherewith to purchase favor
before God: all that we can do is but simply to confess our sin, which were
enough too drown us in despair. Furthermore we have faith, whereby we
recover that which is requisite for our salvation. I say we recover it, by
seeking it in our Lord Jesus Christ. Now then if we say, yea but we be
weak and rude, we cannot mount so high as too the secrets of heaven: let us
look upon the baptism that is given us, as though God reached out his hand
too us. There he shows us to eyesight, after what manner he plucketh us out of
the curse wherein we were plundged, and covers us with our Lord Jesus Christ,
to the end that all our misdeedes should be buried by the perfection of his
righteousness. For we know he yielded such obedience too God his father,
that if we come grounded therevppon, we cannot but find favor at his hand.
Thus ye see how that on the one side God will have us to rest upon him and on
our Lord Jesus Christ his son, to the end we should draw out of the fullness
of that fou^tayne, and yield the whole praise of our salvation to the woorking
of his holy spirit: and on the otherside gives us baptism as a help of our
rudeness and infirmity. Seeing we have all this, what seek we any more? Is
it not a wilful robbing of God, if we will needs have other helps, and put
too other opinions and fancies as they come in our heads? VVhereto serves all
this? But such minglings are Devilish corruptions. Therefore S. Paul tells
us, that we must be so united too our Lord Jesus Christ, as none of us must
advance himself as though he were better worth than his fellows, but
acknowledge our selves beholden too Gods mere grace for all things, and both
great and small must indeuer the same together, and with one common consent
confess, that in our Lord Jesus Christ they have all that is to be wished for,
and therefore give over all the inventions and devices that can come in their
own brain. Yet not withstanding, S. Paul meant not too say that there is no
diversity of degrees as in respect of worldly policy. For we know there are
masters and servants, Magistrates and subjects: in a householde there is the
good man which is the head, and the good wife which ought to be subject. We
know then that this order is inviolable, and our Lord Jesus Christ is not come
into the world to make such confusion as to abolish that which was stablished
by God his father. But when S. Paul says that there is another master nor
servant, man nor woman: he meeneth that too be sure of their salvation, men
must not set up their tails like Peacockes, and stand gazing upon their own
feathers: but look what worthiness so ever we ween too be in our selves,
we must wipe it away and cast it under foot, and acknowledge all to be but
hindrances that turn us aside from coming to our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore when both great and small do acknowledge that they cannot bring
aught of themselves, but must receive all things of Gods only free goodness:
Then is our Lord Jesus Christ himself alone is all in all in us: that is to
say, we will not go about to add aught to the grace that he has purchaced for
us, and which he offers us daily by his Gospel too the end we should be
partakers of it and enjoy it too our salvation. Thus ye see in effect, that on
the one side we must keep the civil orders of this world. Let such as are
great men, and men of authority above others, know that God intends too be
served by them in that state. As for example, let the Magistrates consider that
they be so much the more bound to do their duty, seeing that God has done
them the honor too advance them after that fashion above others. Again, they
that are private persons and ought too obey the Magistrates, must look that
they submit themselves, unless they purpose to strive with God and to make
war against him. Ye see then that S. Paul holds us in sobriety and
modesty, and under a bridle which was not deuized by men, but dedicated of God
too our use, because mankind could not continue without it. And truly we ought
too honor and reverence the state of governance, as a thing ordained of the
Lord. And yet for all that, when we come too the heavenly life, let us assure
our selves that all worldly things pass and vanish away, Cor. 7. e. 21.
as the world and the fashion thereof passes, says Saint Paul: but the
kingdom of God indureth for ever. Then as touching our being children unto
God, and as touching our being his heirs, we come not to it by riches,
nobleness, or dignity, or by any power or virtue of our own. How then? By
Gods mere grace and goodness. For the great ones must be feign to stoop and
to humble themselves, and the little ones must needs wonder at the sight of
Gods so inestimable goodness, who has vouchsaued to lift them up after that
forte above the heavens, whereas they be fearsly counted worthy to dwell upon
earth. Furthermore let us have the skill to profit our selves hereby. Truly
the chief point is that we go foreward and travel still to the inheritance of
the heavenly kingdom, and that our studies, thoughts and desires be chiefly
applied thereunto. But yet therewithal we must also in passing through this
world, have regard of the degrees which our Lord has set too be kept. And when
any are to be chozen to the state of government, to weeld Gods sword, and too
sit in the seat of Justice: let every man bethink himself well, and pray to
God for such as are too be chozen, that they may be found to be good and
faithful Magistrates, and employ themselves too do their duty. And let us on
our side walk peaceably in their obedience and subjection: let us feel there
as it were the first fruits of the kingdom of heaven: and let us consider that
our Lord Jesus Christ does by that sign show us aforeha^d that he has a care
of us, and ouerlooketh us, and watches over us, until we may feel it to the
full when he shall have gathered us up to himself. And to the intent we may the
more cherefully and with the better courage bear the yoke which he has
appointed: let us understand that it is acceptable too him, and a sacrifize
which he likes well of, when we walk according to the order which he has
stablished, and when we proceed to live, not only without doing any man
wrong, or without offering any violence or deceyt: but also do walk in all
godliness and honesty, Tit. 2. c. 12
(as S. Paul says) that is to say, when we first fear and reverence God
above all things, and labor to dedicate ourselves wholly unto him: and
secondlye live after such a sober manner, as we do well show that we be not
given to the world, though we dwell in it: but that we take it as a strange
country, through the which we travel continually toward the heavenly rest,
till we see the thing in very deed which is taught us here, that is to wit
that we have not bin knit unto our Lord Jesus Christ in vain.

And now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God with
acknowledgement of our sins, praying him to make us so to perceive them, as
we may continually seek him, even with as earnest zele as may possibly be, and
give ourselves wholly to our Lord Jesus Christ, to the end that being joined
to him, we may give over all the cares of this world, and still more and more
go forward to the felicity of the heavenly kingdom, till we be fully come
thither. And so let us all say, Almightye God heavenly father. etc.

The.xxiiij. Sermon, which is the first upon the fourth Chapter.
1 I say that while the heir is a child, he differs nothing from a servant,
although he be the Lord of all things:

2 But is under Tutors and gouerners till the time appointed by the father.

3 We also likewise when we were children, were kept in bondage under the
ordinances of the world.

4 But when the accomplishment of time was come, God sent his Son, made of
woman, and made under the Law.


IT is out of all doubt that there was never yet; any mo means than one
whereby men might atteine too salvation. And whereas many men bear themselves
in hand, that they shall by their own merits obtain the thing that they hope
for: it is but a mockery and a beguiling of themselves. For (as has bin
showed heretofore) we are all of us rejected of God, cursed, and the children
of wrath. On our own part we be not able to recover that which we have lost
in Adam, but God must of his infinite goodness be feign to work in that
behalf: for all other helps are vain and vnauaylable. But, now has God
stablished one only mean whereby men may get out of the dungeon of cursednesse
wherein we be all hild. Therefore it must needs be that the fathers of old time
were saved by Gods mere grace, 2. Cor. 1. d. 19.
even as we be, which hope for the like at this day. For it is too be seen in
the second Epistle to the Corinthians, that all the promises which God has
given in all ages, were grounded upon our Lord Jesus Christ, and that he is the
pledge of them, which makes them auaylable and gives them effect and force
toward us. Then, to be short, it must needs be, that there is but one
salvation common to all the faithful, both which are at this day, and which
have lived at any time since the beginning of the world: and it must needs be
also, that God has gathered us together in one accord, to the intent we should
be reconciled to him by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by that mean
be counted rightuous and enjoy the inheritance of heaven. Yet notwithstanding,
we see great difference between the Church that is now adays, and the Church
that was under the law. For the fathers were subject to many Ceremonies. They
were circumcised from their childhoode. Besides this, they had their
Sacrifises, washings, and such other like things. At this day all those things
are abolished, and none of them is in use. How then shall, we say that the
substance of faith is all one among us and the fathers, and yet that the
government was diverse and that God has utterly changed it? If it be
alleged that this diversity proceeds of God: it would seem that he is
variable. And if it be said that it comes of men: then must we conclude that
we hold two sundry ways, and that there was great odds between them and us. I
have answered already too the first objection that may be made: namely that
there is no variableness in God, though he have altered the order of
government in his Church. For when he sends fair wether or foul, heat or
cold, and disposes the seasons of the year diversely, shall we say therefore
that he changes his mind, and that he is mutable in himself? No, but
contrariwise we must say that he has ordained the things that were convenient
for mankind, and yet notwithstanding does by those changes and turnings warn
us that we must not seek our rest here beneath, but pass away as wayfarers,
and as they that undertake a long journey to come to the kingdom of heaven. As
touching the second objection, Saint Paul shows that if there be any
difference betwixt us and the fathers that lived under the Law, it is not in
that our religion is not all one, it is not in that we have not all one God,
it is not for that the promises which we receive belong not to us nowadayes, or
for that our Lord Jesus Christ has not at all times had the power to make
atonement among al men, even from Abell to those which shall be found in the
last end of the world: but he says that the diversity is in the outward
government. And the better to express that, he alleges a similitude which
we ought to be well acquainted with. For if a father leave his children
fatherless and under years of discretion, he will appoint tutors and
governors of them till they come too full age. When the father is deceassed,
his children shall be under Tutors and gouerners, without enjoying of the
goods that their father has left them* and yet do the goods belong to them:
nevertheless they have not the rule of themselves, but in sted of following
their wanton appetite, men give them schoolebutter with a rod. Thus ye see
that although the children be heirs, yet have they not liberty at the first
day, because they be too weak, and have another wisdom nor discretion. Now
according to this similitude Saint Paul says, that the fathers, (that is to
say the Jews which lived under the law) were Gods children and heirs as well
as we: but that the Church was the^ as it were under age as a young child, and
needed a bridle, and therefore they were in ^^^age and subjection of the law.
S. Paul then compares Gods law whereby the Jews were hylde in straight awe
under the yoke of Ceremonies, I say he compares it to a Tutorship. But now is
that time past and gone says he: for God has sent his only son, in so much
that in our Lord we be men growe^ and are come to such perfection of age,
that the government which was under the law is now superfluous and
unprofitable, yea and it should be altogether contrary to Gods will, and to the
order which he has stablished. And so we see whereat S. Paul amed. For it is
a thing of great importance to know that our Lord Jesus Christ is no newcome
thing, as though god had suddenly bethought him to remedy the destruction of
mankind. For Christ had that power from the beginning, and it behooved all men
to seek their salvation in him, for the faith has always bin one selfsame, as
the Apostle alleges in the Epistle to the Hebrews. Heb. 13. b. 8
And truly Abels sacrifices were not accepted for any worthiness that was in
his own person, nor for any value that was in him: but only by the means of
faith: faith was feign to be his foundation and buttresse. In respect whereof
also the Apostle says, Heb. 11. a. 4
that our Lord Jesus Christ which was yesterday, is also to day, and shall be
still to the end. Therefore we must be well resolved of this point as a thing
undoubted and out of all question: namely that we in these days have not any
new hope of atteining to salvation, but the very same that has bin at al
times heretofore, and that the Gospel is not a newfound doctrine forged within
these few years, but the very same doctrine wherein all the rightuous men that
ever were, have bin instructed. And truly it has bin said heretofore, that we
be made the children of adoption when we once have our Lord Jesus Christ. For
S. Paul intended to rebuke the folly and presumptuousnes that was in the
Jews, for that they boasted always of their earthly lineage. He shows that in
this behalf we must have respect of nothing but of the incorruptible seed of
Gods word, whereby we be begotten new again. Now when God adopteth us and
receives us to be his children, the^ does he auow us to be the spiritual
offspring of Abraham. How then ca^ we be Abraha^s children, except we agree with
him in faith? Ye see then that Paul's handling of this point here is to good
purpose: namely to do us to vn^^^sta^d, that from al time out of mind, then
has not bin any other mean to renew men to salvation, and too bring them into
Gods favor and love, than by trusting in Jesus Christ, and by fleeing
altogether unto him for refuge. Thus ye see why it is said that young children
are masters of the house, and that the inheritance belongs to them, though
they do not yet enjoy it by reason of their age. And here we have also to
mark further, that it were great wrong to the fathers of old time, to shet them
out of the fellowship and onement of the faith that is showed here by Saint
Paul. For their life was of all men's most miserable, because God kept them
occupied with many afflictions: and the lives of the fathers (specially of
those whom God marked out too make them excellent) were all mirrors of
invincible patience. For what things endured Abraham? How hard and great
incounters did he hear out? What manner of temptations did Isaac and
likewise Jacob abide? Again what virtues see we in David? Now if they had set
their mind upon this world, they had bin in worse plight than the brute beasts.
Therefore (as I have said before) it must needs be that they looked higher:
and that did they witness sufficiently, not only by word of mouth, but also by
deed. Then let us mark well the point that is set down here: which is,
that the fathers hoped for the selfsame heritage that we look for, even by the
means of our Lord Jesus Christ. And for as much as we agree with Abraham, David
and the other holy kings and Prophets in faith: we shall be gathred into the
heavenly life with the^, and obtein the same crown of salvation with the^, 1.
Pet. 2. b. 9
which is the reward of faith as S. Peter terms it in his first Epistle.
Furthermore whereas S. Paul says that the child differs nothing from a
servant: he does it, always to magnify Gods grace toward us, and the
privilege which we obtain by means of the Gospel. It is much for us to be
called the children of Abraham: but it is much more when it is said of us, that
God has advanced us to a higher degree by the Gospel, than ever Abraham came
unto. For in as much as our Lord Jesus Christ was not yet come: he was under the
yoke of the law. But we at this day are free from it: and so ye see that God
has exalted us above all the Patriarks and Prophets. And well ought we to
acknowledge this grace, and to esteem it as it deserves, to the end we^ ^^ay
give ourselves to the serving of God with the earnester affection and zele.
Chap. 4.
But (as I have touched already) we must mark, that S. Paul speaks not here
of any several person. For there is none of us all but he ought to confess
himself to be much rawer and weaker in faith, then were the Prophets and
Patriarchs: and that does their lives show full well. Then if we be not come to
such perfection as they were, how is it said that they were as little children,
and that we be nowadays as it were at the state of men? I told you before, how
S. Paul speaks not of one man or other, but of the common government of the
Church. For he speaks not of the men themselves, but of the fashion that God
used in guiding those that are his. This will be showed the better by things
contrary. 1. Cor. 3. a. 2
S. Paul vpbraideth the Corinthians, that he was driven too give them milk
as to little babes, because they were not yet able to brucke strong meat, and
he makes them ashamed of their dullness, and of their weltring in their
untoward afectio^s, for that they had not profited in the faith as the time
required. Therefore it was a kind of childishness for them to be always new to
begin. Yea and we see how the Prophet Esaias condemns the Jews yet more
roughly, Esa. 28. c. 10
when he says that they were little children, to whom me^ say A, A, B, B, so
as they be still new to begin agein, and look what they learn to day, they
forget to morrow, so that they never go forward but with great hardness. This
is a vice that is too common in the world. Ephesians. 4. c. 14
Moreover, S. Paul in the fourth to the Ephesians, does generally exhort all the faithful and al such as are well strengthened and able to be teachers of
other me^, which be as it were antesigne bearers to show the way of salvation:
I say, he exhorts the^ to grow still til they be come to the full age of
manhood. It should seem at the first blush that there is some contrariety. For
he says here, that al those whom God has received into his Church and made
them of the household of faith, are already come to full age, yea even the
veriest idiots that scarsly understand three words of faith, so they have the
principles and as ye would say the gross fu^me of the power of our Lord Jesus
Christ S. Paul says that they be already as good as men grown, and that God
will not hold them any longer as children under a master, or as under tutors
and gouerners. And in another (...) he says, that not only such as are weak
and ignorant, but eue^ the excelle^test sort, which ought to carry the torch
before others to give them light, must grow still. And how long? Not for a
year or two, but al their life time: so that as long as they live in this
world, they must daily acknowledge themselves to be weak still, and that they
have need to enforce and streine themselves to go forwarder and forwarder. But
all this agrees very well together. For if every man examine himself what he
is, surely even the forwardest of all, shall find themselves to be still as
little children. For although we indeuer to come unto God, yet we drag our legs
after us: and howsoever we be disposed of ourselves, a number of hindera^ces
step before us, and every little straw stops us: or else if a fly do but
cross our eyes, byandby we be ready to turn away. And although we had never
so great courage in us, yet have we many vices to fight against, and our
knowledge is not such but we have need to pray God daily to increace our
faith, and correct the remnant of unbelief that is in us. Thus ye see what
every man shall find on his own behalf. But if we look upon the fashion that
God keeps in guiding and governing his Church: it is certain that we be
fully men grown. And why? For we be no more hilde in so straight subjection of
the law as the fathers were: but for as much as we have our Lord Jesus Christ,
we resort unto him, when we have sinned. We see welynough how we be berayed
with spots and blots before God: but yet is our washing ready at hand, in
so much that by being dipped in the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ by faith
through the working of the holy Ghost, we become pure and clean, and God
accepts us into favor. Again we be bound to everlasting death by reason of
the faults that we commit daily against him: but yet the amends for the^ is to
be found in our Lord Jesus Christ, for he is ordained the ransom to discharge
us. Ye see then that we be no more under the bridle whereto the fathers were
subject, namely in respect of God and of his governing of us. Therefore although
we feel our own infirmities, yet does not that bar us from being men
grown: that is to say, it is not let but that God gives us greater liberty
and privilege, than he did to such as lived under the law. Thus in effect that
question is assoyled. And it serves to bring us back too that which I have
touched already, (...) that we must magnifye Gods grace toward us, for
aduauncing of us to such dignity. But therwithall we see also, that it is not
lawful for men to devise a new government at their own pleasure under pretense
that folk are raw, or that many are not yet fit to be led and guided after a
higher and wiser fashion. And it behooves us to mark that well. For when the
superstitions that reign nowadayes in popery did first enter into the world:
they began not with such devilish blasphemy as they be now maintained with.
For look how many Ceremonies there are in the popedom, termed by the name of
Gods seruis: so many be their Idolatries and the Illusions of Satan: and to be
short, all is abominable before God. Why so? For they imagine them to be
things necessary to salvation, that by the means of them they be able to
ransom themselves, and too get forgiveness of their sins. Moreover they
deface our Lord Jesus Christ and the grace that is brought us by him, because
they hope too ransom themselves by their own satisfactions, and by that
means vsurp and pluck to themselves the thing that belongs to the son of
God. Thus ye see that they be cursed villains. Nevertheless when al their
gewgawes were first brought into the Church, they were not yet full of so
gross dotages: but they crept in under a somewhat more favorable pretense:
that is to wit, that men were rude and dull, and unable to comprehe^d the
secrets of the kingdom of heaven, if they had not bin handled and dandled
after the manner of little children. Now (as I have touched already) it is true
that every man ought to humble himself when he knows his own infirmity: but
yet does it not therefore follow, that we should bring up new fashio^s after our
own fancies. We must be co^te^ted with that which God has ordained. A young
child must not choose his tutor of his own head: no, he should not be suffered
to do so: But his father will apoint him one. True it is that there are other
means stablished by laws: but here S. Paul has taken a similitude agreeable
to the matter that he deals with. Then if an earthly father have authority to
apoint Tutors to his children: why should not God have the same power? A child
shall not be licenced nor suffered to choose a Tutor to his own liking. Since
it is so: by what right or title will we devise this or that, too say, we
be young ^^yldren, and therefore we must have a fashion meet and agreeable to
our slenderness? Yea, and God has provided one for us: now shall we be wiser
than he? Howsoever the case stands, the very cause why men's wits have bin so
tickelishe to devise store of Ceremonies in the Christen Church, was that they
saw so much rudeness among the common people. Yea mary (say they) it is good
reason that there should be this and that. Baptism were to simple a thing if
there were nothing else to be seen in it but water, and that water would not
be sufficient. For there are a great number of lay folk, which are so dull
that they understand not what that mystery means, that is to wit, that we
be renewed by our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore there needs oil and cream to
represent the holy Ghost, as it were in a visible figure. Besides this there
needed light, and a white Chrisome, and salt, and eft one thing, and eft
another. Very well: thus was baptism daily decked, yea in the opinion of men:
but all of them are but defilings: for did not our Lord Jesus Christ, who is
the inco^prehensible wisdom of God his father, know well enough what should
be for our profit? Shall men come creeping like little todes, and seek I wot
not what, and bear them selves in hand that the things which our Lord Jesus
Christ has ordained are imperfect, and that they will take in hand to make
them perfect? As much is to be said of all the rest. Specially the Supper of
our Lord Jesus Christ has not only bin corrupted and maimed: but also utterly
defaced by the diuelishe abomination of the hellishe mass. For they make it
to be but an ordinary matter to take a bit of bread and to drink three sippes
of wine. [Gods word wills us to] look to the promise [namely] that we be
made partakers of the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we
receive his holy Supper with true faith and obedience, and that in him only
lies the food of our souls. But contrariwise men have bin feign to apparel
themselves like players in an interlude, and therwithall to use so many
murlimewes, as it was a shame to behold them: and what was the end of al?
Mary ^ir, it was a sacrifice for the remission of sins, both of quick and
dead. VVherin ye see how our Lord Jesus Christ is berefte of his priestly
dignity which was given him of God his father, eue^ with solemn oath that he
should never have any successor: but yet for all that the Papists make him a
thousand thousand successors. And what manner of men I pray you? Surely if
they were Angels of heaven, yet ought they to be taken for devils. But their
choice is of all the vermin of the world, of all the rascals, and of all
naughtipackes: and shall we say that such a rabble are the successors of our
Lord Jesus Christ. And yet nevertheless ye see what the Papists allege for
their covert: namely that men must needs have some helps because of their
infirmity. And thereof came all the residue of their superstitions: as for
example, when they did set up their Idols and puppets, they termed them the lay
men's books. But we see that all their malapertnesse is confounded here, when
S. Paul brings us back to the order that God has set, because we must all
wholly hold us too it, and there rest. So then, will we not disclayme the
heritage of heaven which our Lord Jesus Christ has purchased for us? Let us
follow the government which God has set down in his Church, and assure our
selves that God will supply al wants. How rude or raw soever we be, he can
well skill too draw us to him. Yea, so we keep the beaten way, for as for
them that have so mingled and turmoyled things, and pyled up such a heap of
Ceremonies: they have so little remedied their infirmities thereby, that they
have rather estraunged themselves quite and clean from our Lord Jesus Christ.
For we know that men are of their own natures too much inclined to visible
things. Therefore by taking up many ceremonies, men are so entangled, so
snarled, and so depely drowned in them, that afterward they forsake God and
our Lord Jesus Christ. If any man allege, why so? Had not the fathers of old
time many ceremonies also too help their infirmities? Yes: but all theirs were
revealed too them by God. For first it was told them that the pattern of all
those things was heavenly, as it is said in the.xxv. of Exodus. Exo. 25. d. 40.
And it was showed too Moses in the mountain, too the intent they should not
muse upon these present and corruptible things. And when God saw they were
too much given unto them, Psa. 50. b. 8 and Esa. 66 a. 3.
we see how he rebuked them sharply by his Prophets, saying: away with your
sacrifices, fie on them, for think ye that ^^ake pleasure in your cutting of
the throtes of beasts, in hope too pacify me thereby, as though I were an
hungered or a thirst? Think ye that I have need of such helps? Ye see then
that God did always draw his people from superstition, notwithstanding that
there were many ceremonies ordained, which was done for the necessity of the
time. For it was requisite that there should be figures and shadows in the
absence of our Lord Jesus Christ, according too S. Paul's saying, who tells
us that the fathers of old time were by that means directed too seek Christ:
but now that he is come, we have no more need of any such thing. As for
example, if a man be away from me, so as I can not come too the sight of him,
and I would feign have a representation of him too find him out by, I must at
leastwise have an Image that may resemble him: but if I see his body present,
and may behold him face too face, I need no more any Image or counterfeit too
paynte him or express him more lively unto me. Even after the same manner the
fathers of old time had many figures and shadnwes, Mal 4. a. 2
because our Lord Jesus Christ was not yet revealed. Mat. 27. f. 51.
But now that he shines upon us, and shows him self as the daysonne of
righteousness so brightly unto us: were in not a wilful burying of him
again, if we would needs have figures still? And for that cause also was
the veil of the Temple rent a sunder at his death. For now a days we may
enter in familiarly unto God, and offer him our spiritual Sacrifices, that is
too wit, our prayers and petitions, and that is because we have the very body
and substance as Saint Paul says in another text to the Collossians.
Colos. 3.
Now then we see that all they which have forged new devises after that sort,
have utterly corrupted and falsified the Gospel, and have tied towels and
napkins before men's eyes, too keep them from the seeing and knowing of Jesus
Christ, as they ought to have done, and as was requisite for their salvation.
And therefore it is certain that all they which busy them selves about such
gewgawes, do in stead of seeking Christ, throw them selves headlong into
damnation by following so their own brain. They be so given too it, as they
can not be plucked from it: they play the little children that are buylding of
some house of oyste ^^^els, who are so earnest at their work, that they forget
to eat or drink, and are contented to suffer heat and cold, hunger and
thirst. And why so? Because their fondness carries them away. Again they
remove their stuff too and fro, and bring in this and that, and when they once
begin to set them selves to it, they can never make an end. Even so is it with
men when they will needs serve God after their own liking. Ye see then that
we had need to be sober in that behalf, and to content our selves with the
helps and means that are ordained already to bring us to our Lord Jesus
Christ. We have Baptism and the Lords supper: let us hold our selves
contented with them, for our curiosity will always draw us unto evil, unless
we yield to Gods appointment, and give over al our own speculations and
fancies. Yea and let us understand that it is a blasphemy against God, when
men say [of their own heads] this or that is good for us. I tell you plainly,
when soever men say, we must have this, and we must have that, or we must have
our Church or religion of this fashion or that fashion: It is as much as if he
should say, God was not well advised how we should be governed, he wiste not
what was meet for us. As for example, it seems to them to be too slender a
matter that there should be no more but only water in Baptism: and they must
have somewhat else to give it a greater grace and majesty. Therefore they have
tapers, and salt, and cream, and all the rest of the pompes of their own
making. Lo how men will always be adding of somewhat unto Gods commandment:
which doing is a cursed blasphemy, as I said before. And it rises of this,
that they had not an eye to the principal, but gazed still upon the
appurtenances. The principal is the promises: for all the Ceremonies of the
world are not only vain and baggagely, but also diuelishe illusions, except
Gods word be printed in them, and that that be the thing whereat they look,
and the mark whereat they ame. As how? If we had no promise for baptism, ne
knew to what end it was ordained: what a gewgawe were it? It were much better
for us to forbear it. Agein, if we knew not what the Lords Supper means, it
were better that the remembrance of it were utterly buried. But when Gods word
goes with it, so as we have the promises to w^ ^ant us that we be washed and
cleansed from all our spots by the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ: then lies
all our trust there. And moreover it is said that there we be renewed by the
holy Ghost. Lo how baptism leads us to the promises, and the promises lead
us to Christ, as to the party that is contained in them. Thus ye see what we
have to bear in mind, when S. Paul exalts us in degree above all the
Patriarchs, and those that lived under the Law: namely, that it is not for
that there was not more perfection, constancy, and faith in them, than is now
a days in us. And therewithal (as I have erst said) we be still confirmed
in this point, that there is no new mean of salvation set forth unto us, but
that God gathers us too him for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake, in like wise
as he has in all ages called his chosen, and those whom he lysted too cull
out, and whom he voutsafed too make partakers of the adoption that is imparted
too us at this day. For if it might be said, that men have had the mean too
be justified, and too come in favor with God, but only since Jesus Christ
came into the world: what should become of those that lived before? Our faith
should be but weak, and it would cast us into such a maze, as we should
not wot where too become. How now, would we say? Has not God bin the
father of his creatures in all ages? Was there no salvation till Jesus Christ
came intoo the world? Yes, but where as it is said that the salvation is
manyfested unto us by the Gospel, yet was it also already before: and
although there was a veyle in the Temple, and other shadows, yet
nevertheless the fathers had always an eye unto Jesus Christ, unto whom we
be led at this day. Thus you see how they might walk freely and without
doubting, and how that at this day also there is not any thing that can shake
us, if we keep on our way too our Lord Jesus Christ, knowing that by his
means we be all called too the heritage which he has purchased for us. And
therefore we ought so much the more too abhor these Devils, that ^eare us
in hand and strain them selves too prove, that the fathers of old time were
like to brute beasts, as though they had known nothing of the spiritual
life. Behold a blasphemy meet too deface all the religion of the world. Of
which number was that cursed creature that was punished here according to his
deserts, I mean that dog which durst be so bold as to write, that Abraham
never tasted nor knew of the heavenly life, nor^euer worshipped God but
imaginatiuely, and that the reporting of him to be the father of the faithful
is but a mockery, and that his faith was but a shadow of faith, and finally
that he never knew of Jesus Christ, nor of his coming. Behold (I pray you)
the blasphemies wherewith his books were stuffed. But let us in these days
abhor such plagues of Satan. For it is certain that the said Champion of
the Devil was purposely bent too bring too pass, that there should be no
more faith in the world. For inas much as the Devil transformed him self,
and showed not his horns at the first, it was very dangerous when he came
after that fashion, as it were too dig down the foundation of our faith, as
it were under the earth. And Saint Paul warns us expressly hereof, too the
end we should stand upon our guard, and keep good watch that we be not
taken tardie. Then let us mark well, that whereas it is said here, that to be
made the heirs of God, we must be made the members of our Lord Jesus Christ:
thereby the holy Ghost intends too confirm us, to the end we should be so
much the better disposed to go on forward continually unto God, and to hold
out in the hope till we have overcome all the battles of this world, to be
brought into the spiritual rest which we look for. Also we have therewithal
to mark well, what is said concerning the fullness of time. For according too
men's unmeasurable inquisitiveness, it might be demanded here, why and how
so? Why has God: driven it off so long^ seeing we were forlorn and damned
in Adams fall? How happens it that he has not remedied it rather? Surely S.
Paul does not altogether satisfy men's appetites, but cutteth it quite off by
the waste. And in good sooth if God mente too content us, he should be feign
too feed us with many needelesse things: but he intends too t^ye the
obedientnesse of our faith. And Saint Paul also does bar us of that thing,
in saying, that the fullness of time was not yet come. And what means he by
the fullness of time? He means the time that God has appointed in his own
purpose, and not according as men might have judged of it: for they be no
competent judges of that matter, but must submit them selves to God, and
allow of that which he has stablished. Thus ye see what S. Paul meant by
saying, that the full time was then come, when God sent his only son into
the world. Therefore let us learn that our chief wisdom is this soberness
of submitting our selves unto God, too accept for good and rightful what
soever thing he does, knowing that on our own part, though we have never so
much understanding, it is but folly for us too think our selves aught worth,
or too take upon us the skill of any thing: and that we must learn too
humble our selves to our God, and not do as many men do, who are so hasty as
to say, What? I think thus, and thus is mine opinion. For there is not any
thing more contrary to Gods doctrine; than when men presume so much upon them
selves as too say, thus must the matter go, and so and so do I think or
suppose. Truly it becomes us too behilde as captives, 2. Cor. 11. a. 3.
as S. Paul says in the second too the Corinthians. Let us hold our selves
in such awe, as we may not once lift up our heads too dispute against God,
nor make any estimation of our selves as though we were of some ability. Let
us hold us contented with the liberty that he has given us, and not abuse
the grace that he has granted us, in preferring us before those that were as
Angels in this world, and yet notwithstanding were not advanced to the
liberty which we have by the Gospel. Furthermore S. Paul does here bring
us back to the thing which we ought to consider above all others: which is that
our being at the time of full age in these days, is not in respect of any
virtue that is in us, but in respect of our Lord Jesus Christ. The difference
between us and the fathers of old time, is (as I have said already) that they
were led as under awe, and we be now set free into (...) why are we (...)*
Is it because we be of more value tha^ they^ (...) for that there is any
worthiness in us? No: but because it pleased God too honor us with the
presence of his only Son. Will we then enjoy the liberty of the Gospel?
Let us go right forth too our Lord Jesus Christ, who as he is glorified in
him self, will also bring us intoo the heavenly glory, whereinto he is gone
before us. This is the thing that Saint Paul meant purposely too tell us. As
touching that it is added that he was made of woman, and put under the Law: it
can not be dispatched at this time, and therefore we will reserve it till an
other time.

And now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God, with
acknowlegement of our faults, praying him to make us so too feel them, as we
may mourn and be sorry for them with true repentance, and goo thither as he
calls us, that is too wit, be so rightly bereft of our flesh, and of all the
corruptions thereof, as we may come to the joy whereto he daily calls us, and
unto that vncorruptnesse wherein it behooves us to go forward all the time of
our life. That it may please him too grant this grace, not only too us, but
also too all people and Nations of the earth etc.

The.xxv. Sermon, which is the second upon the fourth Chapter.
4 But when the time was fully come, God sent his son made of woman, and
made under the Law.

5 Too the intent too redeem those that were under the Law, that we might
receive the adoption of children.

6 And forasmuch as you be children, God has sent the spirit of his son
into your hearts, crying Abba, that is to say, father.

7 Wherefore now thou art not a servant but a son: and if thou be a son:
thou art also an heir with Christ,


I Have told you already why S. Paul speaks here of the fullness of time:
namely to abate men's curiosity, who by their good wills would seek to far
into Gods secrets, yea and take upon them so boldly as to reply against God if
he behave not himself after their fancy. To the intent therefore that the
faithful may content themselves with the order that God has kept in sending
of our Lord Jesus Christ: he says that the due season was not before, for
that matter depends upon the only good pleasure of God, and upon his
unchangeable purpose, whereunto it behooves us too submit our selves. And now
S. Paul says, that our Lord Jesus Christ was made of woman, and put under
the law, to acquit those that were under the law. First he says that he
was clothed with our nature, for else he could not have yielded obedience to
God in our behalf, that we might be set free. Howbeit for as much as he was
conceived after a wonderful manner, therefore does S. Paul say he was made or
begotten of a woman. It is true that he was of the seed of David:
nevertheless I have told you already, that there was a secret working of the
holy Ghost in his conception. But how soever it was, our Lord Jesus Christ
took our nature upon him, too the end he might yield obedience to God his
father, as it were in our person. And that was the cause why he took our
nature upon him. And this subjection whereof he speaks, was not of
constraint, but of good will. For we know that the Son of God has all
superiority and soueraintie, in so much that even the Angels and all the
principalities must bow their knees before him too do him honor. How then
could he be subject too the Law, seeing that the Law is such a bondage? This
does no whit deface the Majesty of Gods son, for as much as he abaced himself
of his own good will. Therefore (as it is said in the second too the
Philippians) there is no contrariety in that he might make himself equal
with God without robbery: Phil. 2. b. 6.
and yet that he abaced himself also. So then, for as much as this doing of his
proceeded of his own mere and vnconstreyned goodness: he continued always
in his own state, not withstanding that before men he had the shape and
fashion of a servant as S. Paul also specifieth [in the same place.] How
soever the case stand, let us mark well, that he which was Lord of heaven and
earth, took that subjection upon him, to set us free from it. For we see how
our Lord Jesus Christ was circumcyzed, and when he came to man's age, he kept
diligently all that belonged too the law of Moses: not that he was bound to
do it, but to put away the bondage, and to break the bond wherewith we were
as it were pinched and fettered. Therefore as often as the Gospel speaks to us
of liberty, (whereof S. Paul does also treat in this text): let us come
back to our Lord Jesus Christ, assuring our selves that he became not bond
after that fashion for nothing. Now, there is nothing in him which co^teyneth
not the performance of our salvation. Then must we needs conclude that we be
not any more subject to the bondage of the law, or else it would turn too the
dishonor of our Lord Jesus Christ. For what a thing were it, if after his
yielding of himself to subjection for our sakes, we should still hold scorn of
liberty? It were more convenient that heaven and earth should change their
nature, than too say that the son of God is come down here bylow, and has
abaced himself in manner aforesaid, and yet that we should esteem it but as a
play or trifling thing. For what a dealing were that? Now the^ let us learn,
that we may now serve our God freely, and come directly unto him without being
hild any more so streitly under the yoke of the law as the ancient fathers
were, because Jesus Christ is come, and has set us free. I have told you
already heretofore, in what wise we be delivered from the law. It is not for
that it remains not still as a rule to frame our life by, so as God may
govern us and have all superiority over us. For what a thing were it if we
should be worse the^ the Heathen folk and unbelievers? But it is certain that
they have the law ingraued in their hearts as says S. Paul. Romans 2. b. 15.
He that never went too school, ne has had any teaching at all, nor ever has
herd or red any thing, may notwithstanding discern between good and evil.
Not that he has a perfect skill: but because that howsoever the world go with
him, God to take away all excuce of ignorance, would that men should have that
evidence printed in their hearts, that theft, whoredom, extortion, deceyt,
perjury, drunkenness and such other like things, are vices to be condemned.
Also it was his will to have men know, that to blaspheme his name is an irksome
thing. The Heathen folk knew all this without any teaching. Now then if we
should be lawless under pretense that our lord Jesus Christ reigns over us,
and has set us at liberty: what a thing were it? There would be greater
confusion in the Church, than there is where Satan has made a minglemangle and
put al things out of order, so as there is no bridle at all. But whereas it is
said that we be no more under the law: it is in the same respect whereof
mention has bin made heretofore; namely, that the Law shall not execute any
more this sharpness and rigor upon us, too say unto us, cursed shall he be
that fulfilleth not all things. For so long as the threatening remains and
stands in force, we must needs be as men out of their wits, and as folk
upon the rack ready to be torn in pieces. To be short, we can have no rest
except the sentence of the law be abolished, which is that they which perform
not all that is contained in the law shall be accursed. But co^trarywise let
our consciences bear us record that God pitieth us and bears with our
infirmities as a father does toward his children, and passes not upon the
vices that are in us, but hides and burieth them so as our seruis is
acceptable to him, though there be many things amiss in it: and then are we no
more subject to the law. Not that we should be quite without rule, nor that the
commandments ought not to be preached continually unto us, to the end we may
know what God has ordained and be hild in awe by it: but that we should not be
out of heart if we fall, or halt, or make any false steps: or that if we
cannot discharge our selves of al things so perfectly as were requisite, yet we
should not be utterly dismayed, knowing well that God will always hold us up
by the hand, and not enter into account with us to sift our life rigorously:
and moreover because the Ceremonies that were before the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ, are no more in use as they were toward the fathers of old
time, who were trained by them as in their childhood. For when the brute beasts
were offered in sacrifize, every man behild there his own death, as though the
bottomless gulf of hell had bin opened too swallow up the whole world. At
this day we know that the Son of God has by his offering up of himself in
sacrifize, and by his sheading of his blood for us purcha^^d us ever lasting
rede^ptio^, so that we come with our heads upright before God, not doubting but
that we obtain life by the death of him that was not subject too it, but of
his own good will made himself subject too it as our surety, to the end that
we might be quit and discharged by his death and passion. Thus ye see that at
this day the law is abolished toward us, and that we be delivered from it,
even to obtain the adoption. Howbeit, in speaking so, S. Paul meeneth not
that the Patriarchs, Kings, Prophets and other faithful folks that lived
under the old Testament, were not the children of God as well as we, or that
they knew not themselves to be adopted by faith as well as we: but that the
said adoption was not yet so reveled as it is now adays. For (as we have
seen) the law was a Tutor too rule little children. But we be come to the age
of men, because the son of God has showed himself, and brought us all
perfectness by his coming. Then seeing it is so: we do now enjoy the adoption
which the fathers did but as it were taste of before, because the time was not
yet come. Not that God wrought not in them with such measure of his spirit as
he thought good: but because the case concerns the order of government that
God hild, and not the persons themselves, as I have said already. For in those
days there were shadows and figures, so that it was as a chain of bondage:
but now that our Lord Jesus Christ calls us to him, and that the veyle of the
temple is rent asunder: he has prepared us a Sanctuary, not builded with man's
hand, but of a heavenly making, whereinto we may boldly enter, in as much as he
is gone in thither before us. Ye see then that we be received fully into this
adoption, because the law has no more power over us, as it had in the time of
the figures and shadows. Now too confirm this matter, S. Paul adds, that
God shows that he takes us for his children, because the spirit of his son
is in us, crying father: Speaking of the holy ghost, he does by a circumstance
term him the spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ. For by what title can we be
Gods children, but because we be members of his only son, to whom that
right honor, and dignity belongs by nature? For in that our Lord Jesus
Christ is called the only son of God, not only men, but also the very
Angels of heaven are excluded from that dignity, so that it belongs to
none but only to Jesus Christ. Howbeeit for as much as we be joined unto him,
and he will not be separated from us, but shows himself to be our head, and
we have such union with him as the members have with the head: therefore he
says that either we must have the spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ, or else we
can have no familiar access to our God, too call upon him as our father: and
it were too great a presumption for us too take that honor upon us. For if a
beggar would make himself a rich man's son, folk would laugh him to skorne,
and he should be shaken off with all the shame that might be. And how then
should we silly woormes of the earth, yea and full of all infection and
filthiness, go match our selves with the Angels of heaven, to say that God is
our father? Truly the very Angels themselves cannot chalendge such
nobility, but by the means of our Lord Jesus Christ because he is their head.
Then were it great pride in us if we would take upon us too stie above the
Angels, without coming in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, or without
having his spirit, that we might be accepted as members of his body, and be
intertayned as it were in his person. And therefore also it is said that he
makes intercession for us, and that we call upon God in his name. For if he
were not our spokesman, how could we hope too have our petitions received? Let
us a little consider the feebleness that is in us when we intend too pray
unto God. Although we sigh unfeignedly, and although we have good motions to
lift us up: yet do we faint, and they that think too come unto God with a
perfect zele, beguile themselves, yea even to grossly. But they that humbly
acknowledge themselves to be as they be: do perceive themselves too halt and
stumble even in the very virtue and strength that is given the^. Howbeit for
as much as our Lord Jesus Christ is in the mids, and stands there in our
behalf, and makes us to come near: therefore we may boldly pray. And for the
same cause did the high Priest in the time of the law bear twelve precious
stones upon his breast, and other twelve behind upon his shoulders, wherein were
written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. For although the people were
present in the porche [or outter tabernacle,] yet was there a veyle betwixt him
and the^, so as the Sanctuary was hidden, and nothing was seen of the things
that were done within for a witness of Gods presence. It w^^^ enough that the
high priest went in, Exodus 28. d. 29.
in the name of them al, having in his hand the blood wherewith Gods wrath was
to be appeazed. Then had he the said tablet at his breast, wherein the names of
the twelve trybes (that is too say, of Gods people) were engraven. Also he had
them upon his shoulders, that it might be said how he was there in the name
of the whole Church. Thus ye see how we cry, even by the spirit of our
Lord Jesus Christ, unto God his father, with full assurance that he knows
and auoweth us for members of his son, by whose means he receives us into
his heavenly kingdom, and sets open the gate unto us, so as we have
access unto him familiarly. And this is expressed yet better by the word
Cry. S. Paul could well have said, we say: but he goes further as need
was. For (as I have touched heretofore) here he compares the old fathers with
us, and shows that our state is better than theirs, because God has showed
himself more bountiful toward us, than he did toward them that were under
the law. That is the cause why he says that we in these days do cry out
that God is our father, yea even with open mouth and full liberty, and that we
come boldly to him, glorying that we be taken for his children. Esai. 63. d. 16.
True it is that the fathers under the law did also use the same manner of
speech, as when they said, Lord what shall become of us if thou receive us not
to mercy? Abraham knows us not, no more does Jacob. We be borne of them
as touching the flesh: howbeit, all this natural kindred is nothing in
comparison of the spiritual kindred, whereinto thou have ingreffed us in the
person of thy son. Therefore thou art our father? After that manner did the
whole Church pray unto God as Esaias reports it. And there are many such
textes. And out of doubt it had bin impossible for the fathers too have
offered up good petitions and prayers unto God, without that ground: that is
too wit, unless they had bin fully resolved, that God took them for his
children. For that is the thing wherein the faithful differed from the Heathen
and unbelievers in all ages. The Heathen men did in deed pray unto God,
howbeeit, that was but at all adventure, not knowing whither they should be
herd or no. But our prayer must be grounded upon faith. Romans 10. c. 13.
And Saint Paul's saying shall always be true: namely that we cannot pray
unto God, except we first know and understand his good will toward us.
Therefore it must needs follow that they which lived under the Law, were
fully assured in their consciences that God accepts them for his children.
Howbeeit this was showed them as ye would say but with half face, so that
they prayed being wrapped in many shadows and figures, which taught them
grossly. It is true that they offered not themselves without faith (for then had
it booted them very little,) and that it stood them on hand to over come all
the lettes that were set before their eyes: but yet were they not able too call
upon God with the full certeintie which is communicated too us under the
Gospel. Romans 8. c. 15
And this is yet better expressed in the eight too the Romans, where Saint
Paul says that we have not now received the spirit of fearfulness and
bondage, but the spirit of boldness, so as we be able too cry Abba, father.
And by the contrary member he inlighteneth the matter that might be darksome
in this Text by reason of the shortness of it. For he sets down the
spirit of bondage, because the Law was given with great terriblenesse, and
the old fathers were driven too feel that they were hilde in awe under it and
had not yet the liberty that is purchaced us in these days by the coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ. They were as little children: who although their fathers
travel for them, know not what is laid up for them. For although their
fathers love them: yet must the rod be walking now and then, and they stand
always in awe. And because they have no discretion to govern themselves, they
know not how their fathers will deal with them. Even so was it in the time of
the Law: There was a kind of fearfulness, in so much that they which were
Gods children, were yet under the streit bondage before said. Exodus 19. c. 16.
and 20. c. 19.
But Saint Paul says that we be no more as it were at Mount Sinai, where
God thundered, where the lightenings flashed, where trumpets sounded, and where
the air rored in such wize, that all men were so amazed as they durst not
come near God, according as it is said, let not God speak unto us, for then
are we all dead and undone. We be not now in that fear says Saint
Paul: but God has given us full liberty because our Lord Jesus Christ is
come. And we know that he is gone into heaven, to the intent that the, heavenly
(...) one should not thensforth have such terrible Majesty as to make us
shrink back from it: and that we might find favor and grace to talk
familiarly with our God. Thus ye see in effect what this word cry imports.
Now, it is true that the faithful oftentimes shall not feel so frank and
free a mind in themselves, but that they shall be distressed when they open
their mouths, and (...) ^artbitings, and cast doubts whither God will hear
them or no. Heaviness will so ouerpresse us, as we shall hardly know how to
dispoze our prayers, or whereat to begin. This then is a thing that might seem
contrary to that which S. Paul speaks here, and to the text which I am
about to allege. For it will follow that we be cut off from the array of the
faithful, if we doubt in our selves whither* we may pray unto God or no and
that our hearts be as it were locked up in those doubtings. If we be at that
point, in what case are we then? where is the trust that S. Paul speaks of
here? Romans 8. d. 25.
He discharges that doubt immediately, saying that Gods spirit supplieth our
wantes and infirmities. For there are certain unutterable gronings which God
hears, although they be not perceived of me^: Therefore let us first mark,
that if we have profited in the Gospel, we must believe assuredly that God
takes us for his children, and that he calls us gently unto him, and that we
may boldly come unto him. According whereunto he says in the third to the
Ephesia^s, Ephesians. 3. c. 12.
that by our believing in Jesus Christ, we by and by co^ceyue trust and
boldness to offer our selves unto God. Then if we have not trust and
boldness, it appears that we have no faith. Howbeit for as much as our faith
is never perfect, but indureth br^^ts whereby it is as good as beaten down too
outward seeming: sometimes we be so dismayed at it through the ouerpressing
of our miseries and afflictions, that God seems too be estraunged from us,
and we cannot utter one word of prayer unto God. And therefore let us receive
that which S. Paul says: namely that the spirit helps our infirmities. And
so let us hold out still and pray unto God without ceassing, and if we be
speechless, or do stutte, and cannot utter any one piece of our mind to the
purpose, but be entangled with many impedimentes: well, howsoever we fare,
let Gods spirit thrust us foreward still, and let us stick fast to this
ground, that God is nevertheless our fa^^^, and let us flee too him for
refuge, and though we do it not so frankly as were requisite, but be ouerweyed
with the heaviness of our greefes, yet whatsoever come of it, let us go on
forward still, and not shet our selves out of the gate through our own
default, but hold on still in praying to our God, assuring our selves that he
will have pity upon us in the end. Thus ye see what we have to consider here
when mention is made of the spirit of boldness or trustfulnesse, whereby we
may cry [vnto God,] because we be sure of our adoption. Let us not think that
this can be fully in us, for there are many vices which we be not yet rid
of. Again there remains unbelief, which if it be not thoroughly rooted in
us, has notwithstanding many strings too hold us back with, so as we must
be feign to strive against them. But yet in the mean while, we must be fully
resolved that God is our father: and afterward according too our measure and
ability, let us keep onwarde to the mark that is set forth here. And it is
one of the greatest controversies that we have with the Papists in these days.
For they say we cannot be sure that God loves us, and that it is a case which
ought to hang in suspense whether he love us or hate us. But by this means
they utterly deface the true manner and fashion of praying. For we know how
the Scripture says, that we cannot pray without faith, Ia. 1. a. 6. 7.
and S. James says, let not such a man think that ever he shall be heard,
that is to wit, such a one as comes like a wavering reed that is shaken too
and fro with every wind. For we must believe that God is faithful in his
promises, and that we shall not be disappoynted in coming unto him, because he
has bidden us come. We must be thus minded in all our prayers and petitions,
or else all is nothing worth. Again what Christianity is there in us if we
have not Gods spirit, as says Saint Paul in the.viij. to the Romans? Romans
5. a. 5
And for for the same cause also does he say in the fifth Chapter, that we
shall never be ashamed of our hope, because Gods love is sheaded into our
hearts by the holy Ghost which is given unto us. For if we have no hope,
surely then are we banished out of Gods kingdom, and cannot be named
Christians. And what manner of hope is it? It is (says Saint Paul) that Gods
love is sheaded into our hearts: that is too say, that we be fully settled and
contented because we know our selves to be in Gods favor. And how know we
that? By the spirit. And he sets down purposely the word Sheade,, too do
us too wit, that Gods making of us too feel his fatherly goodness and love
toward us, is not with a wette finger and away (as they say,) and then
afterward too leave us hungry and needy: but that he sheadeth or pours it
out upon us, that is to say, that he gives us a sufficient and full warrant
that he acknowledges and auoweth us for his own, seeing he has laid forth
all the treasures of his mercy in our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, this must
needs comes of Gods spirit, 1. Cor. 2. c. 9 and d. 14.
according as it is said in the first to the Corinthians, that we do not now by
our natural wit comprehend that God loves us: for that passes all the power
of man. God then must be feign to lift us up above the world: for it lies not
in our own power to certify our selves of Gods love. Therefore the spirit
gives it us: that is to say, we have it not by nature, nor by inheritance,
neither do we purchase it by our deserts: but God of his own mere goodness
assures us of it, to the intent we might resort unto him familiarly in all
our needs. But contrariwise, the Papists after their own imagination, deem
that we cannot be sure of Gods love. And these wretches are so blind, that
they say it is presumption if we desire to have any certentie of it: yea [and
so is it,] if we would have it of our selves. For if a man would upon his own
conceyte bear himself in hand that God is his father, he should be but a
fantastical child, and a fool at all assayes like one of these dizardes that
gad up and down the streets, and play the Kings and Princes. But if we have
the said record of our God: should we then doubt of it still? Is it a
presumptuousnesse to do God so much honor, as to believe him to be faithful,
and to rest our selves upon his word. Again on the other side; Math. 11. d 28.
when we go to pray, is it not a good forwardness that he gives us when he
says, come too me? If we had no commandment to pray unto God, surely it
were too great a rashness to preace into his presence. But seeing that, he
calls us, yea and taryeth not till we seek him, but preuenteth us, and
tells us that he requires nothing but that we should come to him, and gives
us both the motion and mind too pray unto him: if we take him for our God, let
us yield him his deserved praise, by seeking all our welfare at his hand.
Seeing (say I) that he has so prevented us: should we dispute whither we
ought to follow him or no? Is it not a blasphemy that tends to the defacing
of all Gods promises? Thus ye see what we have too remember when mention is
made of this word Cry. But yet for all this, howsoever the world go with us,
though we be feign too hacke it out like folk that have half forgone their
speech, and be straytened with so many ouerthwartes that we cannot fashion
out one syllable or jot aright: yet whatsoever come of it, let us not leave
going unto God, upon this ground, that he will succor us at our need, and
redress the infirmities that pluck us back. To be short, when the spirit
works in us to stir us up to the gronings whereof I have spoken: let us
seek God, and though we be at our wits end, and know not whereat to begin:
let us always go forward to the mark that is set before us here. And Saint
Paul says purposely, that we cry Abba, father, to signify that it is not
the Jews only whom God will have to call upon him, and to flee to him for
succor nowadayes: but that he will have the whole world to do it. And
forasmuch as the Gospel which is the key to open us the gate of Paradise, is
published every where: now he will have all men to enjoy the right which
heretofore had bin as the special privilege of the lineage of Abraham. Thus
ye see after what manner we cry Abba, father. Now the first word Abba
signifies a father: howbeeit Saint Paul uses the language that was hilde
still as most common among the Jews. For the Hebrewe tongue was not so pure
after the captivity of Babilo^ as it was before, but was mingled with the
Chaldey tongue. Howbeeit Saint Paul's meening here, is to show that under the
Gospel all men in common ought to call upon God with open mouth, because his
adoption was offered to all Nations, and the wall was broken down which
divided the Jews and Gentiles asunder, so that henceforth he will have us to
be equal and in like state. Ye see then that we may call upon God in all
languages, as it were with one mouth, and we must not doubt but that God
receives us and gives us leave to preace unto him, inasmuch as we have the
doctrine of the Gospel to lead us, which is an infallible guide for us.

Now by this means we see that every man's praying unto God ought to be with
understanding. For if a man that understands no more but his own mother
tongue, should pray unto God in Greek or Hebrew, surely it were but a
daliance, and an utter perverting and marring of the rule of praying aright,
and there could be nothing but hypocrisy and feyned devotion in it. I have
told you already that we cannot pray unto God without faith, too be sure
that he will here us. And what a thing is it if we know not what we have to
ask at his hand? Is it not a defiling of so holy a thing as prayer is? We
know that to call upon God, and too flee to him alone for succor, is the
Sacrifize that he requires at our hands, because that therein we confess
him to be our father, and the very welspring of all welfare. Now then it is
meet that we should resort unto him which is the rewarder, according as the
Apostle says in the.xj. to the Hebrews, Heb. 11. b. 6
that he disappoynteth not those that seek him, but that they shall always
find that there is nothing better than to flee unto him. Therefore when we
pray unto God, we must have understanding to know what we crave of him. Mark
that for one point. Moreover whereas it is said that we cry Abba, father:
thereby we be done to understand, that the diversity of languages hinders
not the unity of faith. Esaias seems to use a clean contrary manner of
speaking, Esa. 19. d. 15
when he says, that all men shall speak the language of Canaan, that is to
say, the Hebrew tongue. Now to be Christians and faithful believers, it is
not of necessity that we must have skill of that language: but he means that
God shall be worshipped in all languages. And he speaks of the tongue of
Canaan, because the Hebrew was a holy tongue wherein Gods secrets were
contained. Forasmuch then as that language was after a sort consecrated unto
God: he says that God shall be honored of all men, and all men shall
renounce their blasphemies, superstitions, and abuses, and there shall be one
conformity of faith among men, and being instructed both in the Law and the
Gospel, they shall all make one self same profession, so as there shall be
one tunablenesse and good agreement among all men. Howbeit S. Paul meant to
express here more clearly after what manner we call upon God: namely that
every man prays to him as now in his own language, and he hears us all. For
God needs not to go to schole to learn this man's or that man's language. And
we know that in praying, speech serves too no other purpose than too stir
us up the more unto it. Also it serves us too witness before men with our
mouths, that we repose all our trust in God. Moreover it serves to help our
infirmity, and because we be lazy and cold, our tongue had need to drive
forth our heart, and to help our weakness and sloth which are ouergreat in
us. But God has no need of none of all this, we need not to cry out alowde
when we would be heard at his hand: for he knows the secret thoughts of
our hearts. Thus ye see in effect what we have to mark. And herein we see
how great sway the Devil bears in Popery, so that there is neither prayer
nor faith. To their seeming there is neither devotion nor holiness, except men
babble in an unknown language, and mumble it up without knowing what they say.
And although the Priests, Monks, and Hypocrites say they understand latin:
men know well enough what their understanding is. Besides this, they make even
a rule of their iangling without knowing what they say, and it is enough with
them to have a final intent (for so do they term it:) so they have that
final intent before they babble their Domine labia, to say we go to pray and
to serve God, although their mind be upon their kitchen, or upon things much
worse, and much more shameful: they bear themselves in hand, that all their
prayers and supplications are acceptable to God. The poor people have their
eyes bleared at it: for they be made to believe that it is not lawful for them
to pray in a common language, and therefore they shun that as a bugge. We
see then that the Devil has besotted these wretches, yea and utterly
bewitched them, seeing they be so loath to receive the food of life, that in
stead of good bread and wholesome meat, they receive poison and burst with it.
But for our own part we see the rule that is given us here and which we
ought to keep: which is, that when we pray unto God we must not step to it
unadvisedly without bethinking of us what we should demand, or without
knowing how we should behave our selves toward him. And when we call him
our father, let us consider well that it is not for any wo^thinesse of our own
persons, nor for any desert or work of our own: but because he has united us
to our Lord Jesus Christ, and gathers us altogether in him, and because we be
his body, and God accepts us to favor in his person. And for that cause
also does Saint Paul add, that if we be children, we be beyres also. As if
he should say, that we enjoy our inheritance even now: not that we be entered
into the possession of it, to be partakers of the glory that is promised us,
but as in respect of the fathers of old time, which were shet out into the
body of the Temple, and had a veyle or Curteyne drawn before them, with other
figures and shadows. Now, we be not like them in that case: but we repair
unto God in such wise as we be frank and free. And so is the adoption
otherwise in our hearts nowadayes, than it was in theirs in the time of the
Law. For we be heirs after such a sort, that yet notwithstanding we be
also as pilgrims in this world, 2. Cor. a. 6.
and (as says Saint Paul in the second to the Corinthians) must be feign to
be absent from God, till he have rid us of this mortal body, and have taken
us out of this earthly pilgrimage and transitory life. Howsoever the case
stand, we must magnify Gods grace: and seeing he has adopted us to be his
children, let us understand that therein lies all our happiness and joy.
Therefore let us glory in that, yea even so far forth as to rejoice in the
mids of the troubles and adversities which we have too suffer. Let us not
cease to have an inward joy continually in us, in as much as God calls us,
and has told us that all the adversities which we endure, shall be turned
to our welfare and salvation, so we hold on to the mark that is set before
us, that is too wit, so we go on still forward to our Lord Jesus Christ, and
forsake all other things.

Now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God, with
acknowledgment of our sins, praying him to make us so too feel them, as it
may humble us before him, and yet we not be discouraged but that seeing he
vouchsafes to accept well of us, and has also bound himself to us of his
own good will to hear our requests when we come too him with assured trust
in him: it may please him to grant us the grace to overcome al distresses and
lets* and all debates and controu^^^es that Satan can put in our hearts, so as
we by experience feel the auaylablenesse of this promise, Joel. 2 g. 32.
that whosoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be safe. Act. 2. c. 21.
And so let us all say, Almighty God heavenly father. etc.

The. 26. Sermon, which is the third upon the fourth Chapter.
8 At such time as ye knevve not God, you served them that by nature are no
Gods.

9 But now that you know God or rather are known of God, how is it that you
turn back again to the vveake and beggarly Ceremonies, whereunto ye vvoulde
feign be in bondage again as before.

10 Ye observe days and months, and times, and years.

11 I am afraid of you least I have labored in vain about you.


We have seen heretofore how that after the Galathia^s had bin faithfully
taught by S. Paul, who had taken much pain among them, they shrunk back
again: not that they utterly renounced Jesus Christ and the Gospel: but that
they had bin to easy in suffering themselves to be deceived in following diverse
opinions, as we see it is come to pass through the whole world. For the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and baptism as a mark of faith do in deed continue
still: but yet for all that, we see that all things are marred with
superstition and Idolatry. So the Galathians pretended still to be of Gods
Church: and yet in the mean while they were bewrapped in many follies, as
specially in this, that they should partly purchase grace and soul health at
Gods hand, by keeping the Ceremonies of the Law. But that was to great a
defacing of our Lord Jesus Christ. For it is impossible for him too be our
Savior, unless we lay away all self weening, and put our whole trust in
him. We see then that the fault of the Galathians was, that they were not so
well grounded in the Gospel, as to be firm and steadfast, and to shake off all
errors, but rather were misseled through too light belief. In this respect
Saint Paul says that they be worthy of double blame, because that whereas
God had set them in a good way, and in a good forwardness, they fleeted aside
through their own inconstancy. And he makes comparison between their present
state, and their former state. For they had bin poor Paynims that had never
tasted of true religion. God visited them, and graciously drew them to him, and
gave them the knowledge of his truth. Now forasmuch as hereupon they mingled
the illusions and trumperies of Satan with the pure truth of the Gospel: that
was a fault too far out of square, and no more to be excused than their
former. And that is the cause why Saint Paul says, at such time as ye knew
not yet any thing, it was no marvel though you served Idolles, because ye were
blinded in your errors, and God had never disclosed himself to you, that ye
might have bin able to discern the living God from all the forgeries of man's
own brain. But now that ye have bin taught the Gospel, and obtained so
great a benefit, not by your own travel, as though you had compassed it by
your own wisdom, but by Gods goodness who marked you out before you could
seek him: and seeing he has so gathered you out to himself: what excuce
have you too start away, and not to continue in the doctrine which you know to
be certain and infallible? Moreover look (says he) how ill choice ye have
made. For God had given himself to you, and you have forsaken him for pelting
tryfles. For the Ceremonies of the Law (being set alone by themselves from
our Lord Jesus Christ) are but baggage. Lo how ye make great account of
things too no purpose, and in the mean while pass not at all for God.
Heerevpon as a man moved with great grief he concludes, that he is sore
afraid that he has lost his labor, in that he has so long time streyned
himself too bring them too the pure knowledge of the Gospel. And therewithal
he alleges a spice of the things which he had termed beggarly and
unprofitable Ceremonies: namely that they kept the feasts contained in the
Law, as though there had bin some necessity in the matter, thinking too
deserve and earne grace thereby before God. This is the sum of the matter
that is treated of here. Now we have a good warning too gather of this
text: which is, that if we hold not out in the faith of the Gospel after
that God has once brought us unto it, although the poor Infidels might be
excused, yet can not we escape horrible damnation, by reason of our
unthankfulness in that we have profited no better in the schole of our God.
It is true that although the heathen had no knowledge, yet they shall not fail
to be condemned, because there is naughtiness always to be found in men, for
as much as they gave them selves over to their own superstition: but if we
consider what they be in respect of us, surely whereas they might have a dosen
excuses, we should not have so much as a piece of one. Therefore when we have
once bin enlightened with the truth of the Gospel, like as the benefit of God
is singular, so also shall we pay dear for it if we make not account of it. And
let us mark that this is not said too any one people alone: but that it
behooves us also at this day too apply too our use the things that S. Paul
tells us, to the end that we become not so wretched as to give over the
truth of the Gospel after we have once known it, but that it may be so
printed and rooted in our hearts, as the devil may never shake us from it. Thus
ye see what we have to remember, in that S. Paul does here set the
lewdness of the Galathians before them, and blames them as utterly
inexcusable, for their starting away after that fashion from the pure truth,
after they had once bin enlightened with it. Now also herewithall we see whereof
Idolatry proceeds, and what is the fountain thereof: namely the want of
knowledge of the living God. For we must needs have some feeling in our
selves, that there is a God who^ we ought to worship, and which is worthy to be
honored both of great and small, because we have our life of him. It can not
be so clean wyped out of our mind, but that there shall always be some
spark of Religion in us. But yet in the mean season, every man wanzeth away
in his own foolish conceits, because we understand not what God is, nor can
come at him. Truly if we were not corrupted, and our understanding blinded by
sin, God would still draw us unto him. But for as much as Gods image is
defaced in us, there is nothing but darkness, and that so horrible, that when
we should mount, up alofte too seek God, we thrust down our muzzels too
the ground like wretched brute beasts. Therefore till such time as God show
him self to us, it is impossible for us to have any true Religion, and we
shall always be led with abuses and mere follies. Hereby we know what the
vanity of men is, how every man bears him self in hand that he has skill
enough to govern him self. Yea and we see how the very Idiots do brag of
their wit: and as for those that have gotten any reputation among men, they be
so puffed up with pride, as they can not abide any correction, or to be told
of their faults. But if men had any one drop of good wisdom, were it not meet
that the first point which they begin at, should be to know what God they
ought too worship? That is the point wherein they fail, in so much that they
seek Satan's leasings in stead of the truth, and worship Idols in stead of
the living God, till God have called them to him. We see then that to please
God, and to yield him acceptable service, it is not for us to behave our
selves after our own fancy, but we must suffer our selves to be guided and
governed by his word and holy spirit. Moreover if we will follow the opinion
of this man and that man, they be not a two or three that this text speaks
of, but we see it is impossible to have any good rule, or to hold the right
way, till God have taken the charge of us to draw us too him. So then, they
that follow the steps of their forefathers, and make custom and antiquity
the rule too frame them selves by, do show that they despise God. And why? for
they wilfully leave the fountain of living water, and go to seek puddles, as
though they had no wit to discern between white and black. Seeing then that
S. Paul's meening here, is too show us as it were in a lively image, that men
can not but go astray and deal untowardly, till God have brought them into the
way of salvation: Let us renounce our own nature, and let all things which we
know to come of man be thrust utterly under foot, and let us learn to hold
us simply to Gods pure truth. This (say I) is the thing that we have to
remember upon the words of S. Paul, where he says, that those which knew not
God had served such as were but Idols. Moreover let us not think our selves
too be wiser than the Galathians: but (as I have said already) let us
understand that in this place the holy Ghost mente too beat down all pride,
that men might not presume upon their own reason and skill to do what they
like themselves, but rather know that there is nothing but brutishness in us,
till God have enlightened us with his grace. Furthermore whereas S. Paul
says, that Idols are no Gods by nature, he meeneth that we be very dulheaded,
when we can not repair to the maker of all things, who shows him self both
above and beneathe, too the end we should know him to worship and serve him.
For we can not look upon our hands and our feet, but we must openly see Gods
wonderful wisdom, power, and goodness: and when we behold the skies and the
stars, we have there a sufficient record that there is a soueraygne Lord
which maynteyneth them. When we consider the chaunges of seasons, and see the
snow, rain, wind, or heat: behold therein does God show him self. When
the earth brings forth her fruits, or is as good as dead and withered: in
all those things we continually know God, or at leastwise are convicted that
he shows him self there. And if we will not perceive him now: we shall be
driven too confess it at the latter day when the books shall be opened. Now
in the mean while, if we woorship those which are not Gods by nature: it is
all one as if we did wilfully shet our eyes against so many records and
lookingglasses, which God sets before us to bring us unto him. How soever the
world go, all the worshipping that men can devise is but a vain fancy, till
they have bin brought intoo the good way. For of their own natural wit they
cannot but give themselves to al error and deceiuablenesse. He adds, Now
that you have known God, or rather have bin known of him. Some translate it,
now that you have been instructed in the knowledge of God: but all comes too
one. Nevertheless in the first part (as I have touched already) he shows
that such as have bin trained in the pure truth, are guilty of perjury to
Godward. And thereof they be inexcusable: for it is no ignorance any more: it
is not with them as though they never had tasted of the true religion: but it
^as a manifest falshod, like as if some subjects knowing well inoughe who is
their Prince, should reuolte from him, and break the allegiance which they
had promised him, and confederate them selves with his deadly enemy. Thus ye
see in what plight we be: namely that all such as have known Gods truth,
can not step aside after their own superstitions and errors, but they must
become perjured and false forsworn traitors. Esa. 46. a. 1
For it is not causeless said that all Idols must fall down when God is to
be glorified in his highness: and that all superstitions must vanish away when
his majesty comes abroad. Now if he voutsafe too show him self to us, it
is as much as if he did set up his chair of estate among us, of purpose to be
so good and gracious too us, as too become our king. If we can not find in
our hearts too yield him any subjection, are we not falseharted caytifs
toward him? If we allege for a reply, that our intent is not so: it is but
hypocrisy. For we know that our Lord can abide no companion: in so much
that he uses the word Ielosie, Ex. 20. a. 5
to show that he will so possess us, as we may belong unto him wholly and not
in part. Then if we will play on both sides, and row between two streams:
there will be nothing but fayning and hypocrisy in us. But there ought to be
a substantial soundness in us. And therefore S. Paul says not simply, if we
be beguyled by Satan, and forsake the Gospel quite and clean: but, if we
swerve from the simplicity of it. As for example, the Galathians (as I have
showed already) had not renounced Jesus Christ nor denied their baptism (for
they professed to hold the Gospel still) but they had mingled it, and that
marred all: a little Leven sowreth a whole lump of dowe. Even so when men will
needs add I wot not what of their own brain to Gods truth, it marreth
all. For let a man put a little vinegar, or some other slabersauce into a cup
of the best wine in the world, and he were better to drink sheere water. In
like case is it when men will turkin the true Religion, as all they do which
take upon them too invent I wot not what of their own head. Surely it were
much better that they had never known any more at all, but grossly that
there is a God: than too have been trained up in the good doctrine of the
Gospel, and afterwa^^e too falsify all, and too disfigure our Lord Jesus
Christ after that sort. Ye see then how it is a thing that can not be borne
withal: and that is it which we have to mark in the first place. Secondly, S.
Paul shows that the calling of the Galathians to the Gospel, came not of
their own proper motion, nor through their own furthering of the matter: but
of God, who had sought them out when they were wandering and straying wretches.
And this is not spoken for them alone: for we know how the Prophet Esaias
speaks after the same manner generally of all such as should be partakers of
the salvation that is purchased for us by our Lord Jesus Christ, Esa. 65. a. 1
saying: I was found of them that sought me not, and I showed my self to such
as inquired not after me: and unto such as made none account of me, I said, Lo
here I am, here I am. See how God magnifieth his grace, to the intent that men
should not be so far ouerseene, as to think that they atteine to faith by
their own wisdom. No, says he, ye be all of you in the way of destruction,
and there is none of you that comes to me without I draw him, for pity of
the wretchedness wherein you be plunged. Therefore it is I that have discovered
my self, and all this is of mine own mere gracious goodness, for you would
never have sought me, yea there is none of you all but he withdrew him self
further and further off from me. For we be not only as straying beasts, but
also as wild and wood beasts: we be wholly given to rebellion till God have
tamed us, and changed us that we might be sheep of his fold, that he may do
the office of a shephearde toward us. So then it is not for naught that
Saint Paul corrects this speech of his when he says, you have known
God, or rather have been known of him. As if he should say, that when we
be come too the knowledge of the Gospel, we must not imagine our selves too
be better than other men, but that God prevented us, and that we should
rather have perished a hundred times in our beastlynesse, than have come too
any good amendment, if God had not utterly changed us. Now then we see what
free will is able too do, whereof ignorant wretches boast them selves too the
defacing of Gods grace. No doubt but all men will grant that they can not
be enlightened without Gods working: but (...) by after they restryne it
again, saying that his working is but in part, and it seems to them that
every man brings somewhat of his own. But all this geere is excluded here
when he says that none but only God knows us, who also marketh us out, too
show him self unto us, and too make us come unto him. Then let us generally
understand, that it is not our own worthiness that has brought us too the
obteyning of this benefit that the Gospel should be preached purely too us,
and that every of us applies it too his own behoof: for if I think my self
to have aught at all in me why I should be preferred before one man or other:
it is a taking away of Gods praise, and an usurping of it to my self: and that
were an intolerable trayterousnesse. And therefore we must come back too
that which S. Paul says in another text: 1. Cor. 4. b. 7.
Who has made thee too excelle, says he? He speaks too such as commended
them selves, believing that they had some virtue or excellency in them, as in
very deed the Corinthians had such spiritual gifts as might be had in
estimation among men. S. Paul grants well enough that they had great
graces, and worthy of estimation: but he asks them from whence all of them
came, whether they were of their own getting, or whether they were able too
take them of them selves? It is very certain that they were not. Wherefore
let us learn, that it is not enough for us to have Gods word preached too us,
except God work in us by his holy spirit, according as experience shows in
that it is not given too all men. And moreover there was never yet any man that
bethought him self too seek the good food, except it were offered him of
God. Therefore away with all the fond imaginations of our own head, and let
us put away all pride: let us not think our selves wyser than other men,
because we have known the Gospel: but let us yield this praise unto God,
namely that at such time as we turned our backs upon him, and were as good
as drowned a hundred thousand times in destruction, he cast his eye upon us,
and drew us back too him self, too the end that when it is told us that
we be justified by faith, and thereby obtain salvation: we should assure
our selves that the same comes of his ^^re grace, and that our faith is
^reely given us because we can not purchase it: and let us confess with poor
Agar, Ge. 16. c. 13.
that we have seen him that looked upon us before. For there we have a
mirror of all mankind. The said poor woman was in great heaviness,
forsaken of all men, and wyste not whither too go: but God pitied her and
visited her, in the wilderness. Heerevpon she confesses that God had looked
upon her before she had thought upon him. So then let us be hilde in awe and
humility, seeing that the welspring and beginning of our welfare is that God
knew us and marked us out at such time as we cared not for him, but besides our
ignorance, did also despise him, and were so brutish, that every of us had
sought his own ruin and destruction, if he of his own infinite goodness had
not hilde us back. Thus ye see in effect what we have to mark. But now let us
put the thing in practice that is told us here: which is that for as much as
God has called us to the pure knowledge of his Gospel, we must continue
steadfastly therein, according to the way which he sets before us, who (as we
know) is the lively fountain of all welfare, as it is said in the second of
Jeremy. Then if we go aabout too dig crauyed Cesterns that can hold no
water: is it not an utter refusing of the benefit that was put into our
hands? When a man sees good meat ready for his repaste, and knows that
he may take good sustenance of it, and yet will go his way from the table, and
seek dung and filthe too feed on, is he not worthy too be poisoned? Even so
is it with all such as are not contented with the pure doctrine of Gods Law
and Gospel. For behold, the fountain is before them, Esa. 5* 5.
they may drink their fill of it, John. 5.
as it is said in Esaias and S. John, and yet they had lever too starve, or else
too feed them selves with wind. Now then should not such unthankfulness
be punished double as S. Paul says here? Is it possible that ye should
return again too the unprofitable and weak Ceremonies that can do you no
good at all. Now at the first blushe S. Paul might seem too sharp and
roughe in speaking after that fashion of the Ceremonies of the Law. For in
very truth, although the Ceremonies had bin the first enterances or traynings,
like as in trayning up of young children men are wont too set them first too
their ^psie: yet notwithstanding our Lord Jesus Christ was figured in them:
and there were promises in them too bring men too salvation. For the remission
of sins is the chief good thing that we can wish for at God hand, because
that by that means we be reconciled unto him. He receives us as his
children, and we may call upon him with free liberty. Men therefore are then in
true and perfect felicity, when their sins are forgiven them. And hereof
they had as it were a pledge in their sacrifices in old time. When they
washed them selves, it was a full assurance too them that God did cleanse them,
and that their spots were no more laid to their charge, but rather that they
were received as clean and utterly without blemishe. How then does S. Paul
term these things unprofitable ceremonies, which carried such instruction in
them? specially seeing it is said that the pattern of all the whole Sanctuary
was showed to Moses, Exo. 25. d. 40.
yea even from heaven. The law then served not to hold men in some play, as
though God intended to busy them about petie trifles? neither also did S.
Paul regard whereto the ceremonies auayled or served the fathers of old
time: He does but only show that when our Lord Jesus Christ was once come, Col.
2. c. 17
all those things were abolished. For (as he says in the second to the
Colossians) we have no more the figures and shadows, because that now a
days we have the body and the substance. Seeing it is so: if a man should
set forth the ceremonies of the Law, he should separate them from our Lord
Jesus Christ, and what should they be then? They would be of no force. For (as
I said before) if a man separate them for our Lord Jesus Christ, surely they
shall be but pelting trash. Therefore when men kept the ceremonies, so as they
were applied to their lawful use: they were good exercises, and the old fathers
mispente not their time, because they were confirmed by them in the hope of
their salvation, and they were unto them a warrante of Gods fatherly love
toward them, and they led them to our Lord Jesus Christ the fountain of
all welfare. But if men busy themselves in keeping the ceremonies without
knowing why or wherefore: surely it is but flat mockery. For the Heathen men
did make sacrifice also, and some of them had no Idols, thinking that they
offered too God the maker of heaven and earth: and yet whereto did al their
Sacrifises serve them, but to their condemnation? For they had overthrown Gods
order, because they amend not at our Lord Jesus Christ. Now then Saint Paul
does not without cause say, that when the Ceremonies of the law tend not to the
seeking of all our welfare in our Lord Jesus Christ, they are but beggarly
Ceremonies, that is to say, corruptible things of this world, and
consequently things of no force and unprofitable, because that Jesus Christ who
is the quickner of all things, is not there. And this is yet so much the better
to be marked, to the end we be not beguiled. It is said that in old time all
men offered Sacrifise, and thought they worshipped God: and yet
notwithstanding, that the seruis of all such as had not their belief settled
in Jesus Christ, was rejected. Heb. 11. a. 4
For the Apostle in the eleventh to the Hebrews says, that the only thing that
made Abels Sacrifise acceptable, was faith. Now then for as much as the heathen
men did in their sacrifising imagine God to be fleshly, and that they could make
their attoneme^t with him by such means, they buzied themselves about outward
things, and considered not that in as much as we be faulty, it stands us on
hand to have an excellenter ransom than we ca^ bring any. If we had a hundred
worlds to give, they were not enough too redeem any one misdeede that we have
done against God. Therefore the Sacrifise that should answer for all our sins
must of necessity be heavenly. The heathen men considered not this: but stood
poring upon the shadow of it, as the Turks and Jews do yet still at this day,
who by their often washing of themselves both even and morn, and at noone, and
by their other Ceremonies, confess themselves to be defiled, and to have need
to be clenzed by some others, and yet do renounce our Lord Jesus Christ who is
the very cleanness whereby we must be made clean, according also as in very
deed it is he that has wiped away all our spots. Seeing it a so then, all
they that keep any Ceremonies in hope to get any favor at Gods hand by them,
do not only beguile and martyr themselves in vain without any profit: but also
do certainly provoke Gods wrath still more and more. Now we on our side are
taught that our Lord Jesus Christ has shed his blood too wash our souls
withal. Then if we seek any other ^^nzing or purgatory besides, surely it is
an intolerable treachery. And if Saint Paul spoke so of the Ceremonies of
the law: what shall we say of all the toys and gewgawes that are nowadayes
in popery? For behold, the Papists ween to win much by taking of holywater,
by babbling this and that, by keeping of holidayes, by tyring themselves in
gadding on some pilgrimage, by setting up a waxcandle before some puppet, by
chaunting mass by note, and by saying of thus many or thus many times their
beads over. I say they hope well to make atonement with God by such means.
But it is certain that they plunge themselves the deeper in hell, and cast
themselves further intoo Satan's snares by it, as though they had confederated
themselves with him to their own destruction. To be short, all the
Ceremonies of popery are utter renouncings of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of
the pure truth which he has purchaced for us by his death and resurrection,
and of the grace that is offered us at this day in the Gospel. For they may
well bring what shrowding-sheetes they list, but they cannot disprove the holy
Ghost, who has uttered the said sentence by the mouth of Saint Paul. Then do
we see in effect what is showed us here. Now as touching the particular which
Saint Paul alleges here concerning days, mooneths, and years he meeneth
not the seasons of winter and summer, nor the discerning of one day from
another, nor that men should not reckon years and mooneths: but he speaks
of the feasts that were commanded in the Law, and which those deceivers would
needs have to be kept still, even as of necessity. In which case there was a
kind of binding and thraldom, and it was an abolishing of the fredome that was
purchaced for us by our Lord Jesus Christ. Lo here the cause why Saint Paul
uses such vehementnesse, howbeit that he did it also in respect of the
foresaid falsehood: for it was requisite that our Lord Jesus Christ should have
bin known in all those figures, and that men should have amed at that mark.
But they that had beguiled the Galathians, had bound them to the clean
contrary, seeing that by holding still the feast of Passover and other
feasts, they intended to bring them back again to the old forworne figures,
which ought to be abolished. In old time when men kept (...) Easter day under
the law, it was to the end that the people being put in mind of their
deliverance out of the thraldom of Egypt, should look for the great
redemption that was promised them. 1. Cor. 5. b. 7.
And for that cause Saint Paul says that our Easter lamb (that is to wit,
Jesus Christ) is offered up already. He shows that the thing which had bin
figured by the pascall lamb that was offered in the law, was now fulfilled in
the person of our mediator. In like case was it with the feast of Tabernacls or
Tents, whereby God did put the Jews in rememberance, that they had dwelled in
the wilderness where there was another house nor building, and yet had
continued there a long time traueling too and fro. And that was also a warning
too them that this life is but a wayfaring, where through we must pass in
have. As much is too be said of the firstlings when men came to offer up
their first fruits unto God. Again, when the Jews made solemn confession
of their sins, it was a figure to lead them too Jesus Christ which was
promised to them. But now that he is come, if we will needs keep still those
things, what is it else than a toying? For we displace the principal and the
substance, which is all one as if a man would feed himself with the color
of bread, wine, and meat, and not with the things themselves. And can a man
receive any sustenance thereby? So then seeing that our Lord Jesus Christ is
come, the figures of the law are not too be used any more, and if men will
needs keep them, they show themselves too have no knowledge of God, but that
all is turned vpside down. Therefore it stands us so much the more on hand
too mark well, that if we nowadayes do swerve never so little from the
pureness of the Gospel, we be streytwayes strayed from our Lord Jesus
Christ. I grant we may well keep certain days of assembling, howbeit not
after the manner of the Jews. And why? We keep them not for ceremonies sake.
In the time of the law it had bin a deadly offense for a man to have lifted up
but a mallet upon a piece of wood, or too have done any other business of his
own. If a man had but set a pot or a kettle upon the fire on the Sabbath
day, God commanded that he should be rooted out. Yet was it not meant by
that rigor, that God d^^yghteth in idleness: but it served for a figure, as
if he had said, I have enjoined you my Sabbothes, too the end you should
know that I am he which sanctifyeth you. We have the selfsame
sanctification at this day, howbeit not with like figures as the fathers had
it in old time: for that were too bury our Lord Jesus Christ. It were too
hang up a veyle again, too the intent too dasle our eyes in such sort, as
we should not see the light of the Gospel. Lo what we have too mark upon
this observing of days whereof Saint Paul speaks here. But above all
things let us mark that he intended to show us here, that in as much as we
know the benefits which are imparted too us by our Lord Jesus Christ, we
must stick too them and settle ourselves wholly therevppon: and that if we
be fleeting too and fro, it is a shrinking away from our Lord Jesus Christ,
in whom we have the fullness and perfection of all life, joy, welfare, and
glory. Therefore, seeing that God comes too us after that fashion, yea and
that even at such time as we were as wretched wandering beasts, he gathered
us too himself, and showed himself to be our herdman, too the intent that we
should become the sheep of his flock, and hearken too his voice, and discern
it from all false doctrines, and from all the curious suttleties of men, that
our Lord Jesus Christ might reign over us, hold us in awe, possess us
wholly and we become his, not partly or with condition, but wholly and
thoroughly: let us beware that we become not gilti^e of such unthankfulness
when the Gospel is once preached unto us. Thus ye see what we have too bear
in mind too our behoof in this text, that we may not be accused at the
latter day if God have called us to him, and we left and forsaken him, and
falsified our promis whereas he was ready too have kept touch with us, not
only for a day or twain, but also by continuing too be our father and
savior for ever both in life and death.

Now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us feel them more and
more, and that the same may cause us the better to acknowledge the g^^es that
we have received of him, and that seeing we perceive that they have bin
imparted unto us undeservedly, it may make us to be the more desirous too
taste of them, that therevppon we may day by day endeavor too rid our selves
of our lewd affections, and of all the vices wherein we should be plunged if
he pityed us not and made us not too feel his grace, which it may please him
too continue in such sort, as we may seek nothing but to come home fully
unto, him: and that in the mean while till we come to the full light, where
we shall behold him face to face and be transfigured intoo his glory, he
continue still too show us the way of salvation, and make us too walk
therein throughout. That it may please him too grant this grace not only too
us but also to all people and Nations of the earth, bringing back all poor
ignorant souls from the miserable bondage of errors and darkness, to the
right way of salvation, for the doing whereof it may please him to raise up
true and faithful ministers of his word that seek not their own profit and
vainglory, but only to the advancement of his holy name. etc.

The.xxvij. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the fourth Chapter.
11 I am afraid of you least I have spent my labor in vain upon you.

12 Brethren I beseech you be ye as I am, for I am as you are. Ye have not
hurt me at all.

13 Ye know how I have erst preached unto you through infirmity of the
flesh,

14 And ye another despyzed nor hilde skorne of the trial of me such as it
was in my flesh: but received me as an Angel of God, yea as Jesus Christ.


I Have declared heretofore, that although S. Paul at the first blush bring
not any reason that seems to be of great weight or importance:
yetnotwithstanding it is not for naught that he doubts least his labor be
lost, and all the fruit of his travel among the Galathians be perished,
seeing they observed the holy days and other Ceremonies of the law. For we
must not look upon the day itself, or upon the kind of meat, or upon such
other like things: but we must consider to what end men forbear the eating of
any kind of meat, or why they keep certain days, and so of other
Ceremonies. Now I have told you that by that means the light of the Gospel
is after a sort damned, or rather utterly quenched. For the end why al those
things were ordained in old time, was that the fathers might be foded and
mainteyned in the hope of the redeemer, who was not yet come among the^. But
now that our Lord Jesus Christ is come into the world, and has finished and
performed all that was requisite for man's salvation, it were an utter
derogation too the full perfectness that is in him, if men should still buzie
themselves with figures. It were all one as if a man should draw a Curtain
before him that he might not be known as he is. Furthermore, there goes a
binding with it: and when a thing is commanded under pain of deadly sin,
men's consciences are made subject too such tyranny, that God forgoeth his
authority and dominion over us, for he will not have us to make conscience of
any thing that is not commanded by him. And truly the thing wherein he will
be discerned from his creatures, is that he have all souerenitie in ruling our
life: that the thing which he commands be accepted as good and needful
without gaynsaying: that the things which he forbids, be omitted, and that
men make no reckening nor conscience of them. But in observing the Ceremonies
and in thinking to deserve at Gods hand for so doing, there is yet a further
matter: namely that we renounce or give over the thing that is purchaced for us
by the death and passion of the son of God our Lord Jesus Christ, wh^^e has
discharged us of all dettes due unto God his father. Not to give us liberty to
do evil, but too the end we should flee unto him alone when we have done
amiss. If we find ourselves to have transgressed Gods law, and that our own
conscience vpbraydeth us: there is none other remedy for us but to put
ourselves into the hands of our Lord Jesus Christ, that we may be quit before
God, and washed from all our spots by the merit of his death and passion, and
by the sheading of his blood. To be short, Saint Paul shows here, that men
run astray when they seek means of salvation any where else than in Jesus
Christ, in so much that they become forlorn and utterly past recovery. Now
then seeing that God has set us forth but only one way of salvation: they
that turn aside from that, do cast themselves wilfully into destruction, and
Satan reigns over them for their unthankfulness sake in despising the
inestimable benefyte that God offered them. What a bountifulness is it that
God calls and allureth us too his favor and love, notwithstanding that we
be his deadly foes? Again seeing he appoynteth not the Angels to be our
mediators, but voutsaueth to join himself unto us in the person of his only
son: if we be so miserable that that will not suffice us, but we will needs
of a devilish covetousness seek other means: is it not a shaking off of our
Lord Jesus Christ* Then let us learn, that too profit well in the Gospel,
we must forsake all that is contrary to the trust which we ought to have in
our Lord Jesus Christ: and stick wholly to his ryghtuousnsse, too seek all
perfection in him. Let that serve for one point.

Also therewithal let us look well to ourselves: for sometimes we shall
think we commit but some small and light fault in swaruing aside: but [in the
end] we shall wonder how God has given us head, so as we shall be utterly
strayed from him. And that is the cause why so feaw hold out to the end. For
men do easly bear with themselves, under the foresaid pretense, bearing
themselves in hand that it is nothing, and so every man gives him self
liberty. But God punishes such rechlesnesse, and gives us over to it, so as
Satan carries us away. Wherefore let us walk in fear and warenesse* and when
^od has once given us the grace to taste of his Gospel, let us indeuer too be
confirmed in it day by day: let us beware in any wise that we step not aside
from it, and let every of us be watchful in that behalf, least we make a
deadly fall when we think we do but trippe: finally, let us keep the way
that our Lord Jesus Christ teaches us. It is true that though we swerve
aside, yet he will pity us, as we see by experience. For he must be feign
too raise us up again, not three or four times in our whole life: but a
hundred times every day. For we be fickle and never leave reeling too and
fro. Nevertheless let us not tempte him, nor so harden ourselves that the
Devil lead us away or draw us one way or other: but let us labor too make
the seed of life auaylable in us, seeing that God will have us too yield
forth fruit too his honor in all our thoughts, words, and deeds. Let us
beware that we endeavor ourselves heerevntoo. Now heerevpon Saint Paul
adds, that he would feign have the Galathians fashion themselves like unto
him, because that he on his side labors to apply himself unto them. It
should seem that this saying differs far from that which we heard even
now: for it was as a stroke of some tempest or thunderclap when he said. I am
afraid least I have lost my labor upon you: I will let you alone like folk
past amendmente. It grieved him too see that the doctrine which he had
preached was so ill received, and now he uses a gentle and freendly manner
of speech. To bring them back again unto him, he calls them breethren,
and afterward protests that he desires to join with them, and too frame
himself to them as much as is possible for him, seeking nothing but that they
should yield the like unto him.

And herein we see what measurablenesse they ought to keep which have the
charge to preach Gods word: that is to wit, they must not foade men's faults
by flattery, but rebuke them sharply, to the intent that such as are beguiled
by Sata^s illusio^s, may be wakened and as it were scared at Gods judgments.
For when me^ are given to any evil, they lie weltering in it still, unless
they be plucked out of it as it were by force. Yea a^^ it greeueth and spiteth
them if they be wrung by the ear too hard, or if they be made to scratch
where it did not itch, as the common proverb says. The more then that men
bear with themselves, the less are their faults to be spared, for else it
were a betraying of them. That is the cause why S. Paul used so great
vehemency, in saying that he was sore afraid, least he had lost his labor,
and there leaves the Galathians as it were in despair. But yet for all this,
he intends to cheer them up again, that they may come to repentance. And
so he seasoneth his sharpness with sweetness, and shows that the gate is
still open for them, if they will submit themselves unto God. Thus ye see
two things that are requisyte when we will have our exhortations too be
profitable. The first is, that there be a liuelynesse in us too prick forth
such as have done amiss, that they may be thoroughly touched with the
knowledge of their sins, and mourn and be sorry for them before God: for if
they have not that sorynesse, they will never yield to follow God. True it
is, that to outward sight men may well alter their lewd dispositions: but
how soever they pretend, they shall still be full of stubbornness and
malice, till they be ashamed of themselves and feel what they have deserved.
So then the true preparatiue too repentance, is to be pricked so nearly as
we may feel the evil that is in us, and condemn our selves for it: yea and
that we be full of anguishe, finding no rest till God have received us to
mercy. But yet must we not lie still in such perplexity: for that would
make us too shun Gods presence, and to go about too estraunge our selves
from him for ever, insomuch that we would feign have him plucked out of his
seat, that he might no more be our judge, if we were not well persuaded that
he will be pityfull to us, and that we shall not be disappoynted of our
expectation in seeking of him: according as it is said in the Psalm, that
there must be mercy in God too draw men unto him, Psalm. 130. a. 4.
or else they will never be brought too stand in awe of him. For as for all
the fear of the unbelievers, it is but a terror that dismayeth them, making
them too gnashe their teeth against God, and to frette and chafe and play the
mad men. And such enforced fear has no reverence at all in (...) But when
we have once tasted the goodness of our God, and see how all his seeking is
too be at one with us, and too have us come unto him without feyning, yea and
that his touching of our hearts is too the intent we should conceive sure
confidence, and therevppon offer our selves too his Majesty, assuring our
selves that we ought not too be afraid of it, seeing it is the thing
wherevntoo he calls us: I say, when we be thus assured, namely that our
sins are wyped out: then may we be bold too preace unto our God, and
that is the order which Saint Paul keeps here, and which it behooves us too
keep in all our rebukings. In that place then he did beat down the
Galathians, because they exalted themselves, and did as it were set up
their brystles against God, through their lustynesse. And now he reaches
them his hand, and lyfteth them up again, and tells them that after they
have once felt and perceived their faults, they must not yet for all that
think themselves utterly shette out from God, and from all hope of salvation.
But this cannot be done except we have a carfulness too draw sinners too
salvation. For many men will be vehement enough, and they shall have just
cause so too do: but yet in the mean while their rygorousnesse will be so
excessive, as it shall shette up men's hearts, and make them take such
stomach against the bytternesse that is used toward them, that they shall
cast themselves utterly out of order, yea and conceive a hatred against God and
his word. Howbeeit, they that are so ouersharpe will say they have just
cause. Yea, but yet for all that, they which rebuke sin in the name of God,
must always have a care and desire too bring those too salvation, which were
in the high way too destruction. When they be so minded, no doubt but they
will labor to win such as were out of the right way, and to make them
perceive that they seek their welfare, and that although their rebukings be
grievous, yet they fail not too be for their behoof. Nevertheless, on the
other side, let such as are handeled so sharply, understand that they have
need of such medicines: for what shall they win by ranckling against God?
But yet we see many which can well enough make countenance too be great
Protestants, and too burn in zeal of the Gospel, which yet notwithstanding
will not abide to be touched. So long as they be borne withal, they will
confess what soeuerye will have them and all that is spoken to them, yea and
more too. Ye would think that the Gospel was made even for their turn: but
if a man find fault with them, then they begin to play the wood beasts. And
what gain they by it, saving that first they bewray their hypocrisy before
men, and secondly set themselves in battle against God.

Now it is certain that in fighting against such an adversary, they shall
not be the stronger party. Therefore let us suffer our selves too be rebuked
sharply when need shall require. And if we wist not of the evil that was in
us, we ought too mistrust our selves so much the more, and not seek
startingholes to defend our selves withal, but rather enter into examination
of our selves, and every of us become his own judge, that by means thereof
we may not enter intoo account with our God, nor he be compelled to cite us
too here the sentence of damnation. Thus ye see how we ought to receive the
chastizements, that are put to us, and that we must not be too much grieved at
them, because they prepare and dispose us too humility, but let us in the
mean while wait for the coming of the sweet that follows afterward. For
the thing that keeps many men from receiving the warnings that are given
them, is that they be fully resolved of the matter aforehande: so that if a
man speak a word too them that mislyketh them, they stop their ears at
it, or else their hearts are so hardened and dulled, as they cannot by any
means afterward conceive what is put too them for their welfare and profit.
A man may talk to them of Gods mercy, and protest to them well enough: and
a man may well enough (as ye would say) show them with his finger that his
seeking is nothing else but to bring them to salvation, but they be utterly
deaf: and that is because they be fully bente of themselves too reject Gods
word. Therefore let us be patient and modest, when men step too us upon
the sudden, too assail us roughly by showing us our faults: let us be quiet
at it, and tarry till he have spoken the last word. And so let us interlace
and knitte these two things together: that is too wit, the rygour which we
must take hold of that we may have a true and lively feeling of our sins,
to be sorry for them, and to ask God forgiveness, and to be abashed in our
selves: and then let us assure our selves that God will always be merciful
to us: and when we have so indyted our selves, let us also hope too be
quitted at his hand, and that the more he condemns us by his word, the more
he intends to bear us up, to the end he be not enforced to come against us
with armed hand, and with his sword in his fist. Thus ye see in effect what
we have to remember in this text, where we see Saint Paul on the one side so
sharp and vehement, and by and by afterward too call the Galathians his
brethren, and too pray them that there may be good conformity between him
and them, and one accord and tunable consent among them. Now as touching that
he says, I beseech you be like unto me, for I also do apply my self unto
you: as we have seen already, it is not too soothe them in their vices, nor
too cloak their filthiness, nor too use any flattering of them: but too try
all the ways too the woodde to win them unto God, according as we shall see
hereafter how he will use the similitude of a woman with child, which
longs to see her child borne into the world, and although she endure
pain, yet will not wreake her self upon her babe by strangling it, but be
more chare of it than of her own life. Saint Paul will use the said
similitude. So then he meeneth not here too stryke sail (as they say) too
please such as had need too be rebuked: but rather advanced him self as
far as he could to win them, according also as he will say, that he
has pratled with them as a Nurse does with her child: and that might well
be done without hardening men in their sins. Not that they should be too
much borne withal: for when a Nurse stoupeth too teach her young child too
go, whom she holds by the hand, her intent is not too make him too tumble,
nor too teach him too haulte, nor too make him such a Cockney: that he
should not be able too go when he comes too man's age: but contrarywyse,
when she intends too stay the childs arm, she will take him by the
hand, or by some other part of him.

So then we see after what manner we must fashion our selves to such as are
weak. It is not too harden them in their naughtiness, but rather to amend
them: nevertheless we must go by measure, having always an eye to our own
ability. And truly it is not for naught that S. Paul in another text
exhorts the stronger sort, To. 14. a. 1.
and the forwarder sort, Gal. 6 a. 1.
to apply themselves to such as are yet raw and weak. For if a man had never
so great and excellent virtues, that he were as an Angel: yet surely if he
be so rigorous that he will have every man too be as perfect as himself,
all his virtues will be but smoke. Why so? For the meeldenesse and
gentleness which God commands us, serve to give as it were a taste and
savor to all virtues. And the better that a man knows himself, the more will
he be think him of the vices that are in him, which have need to be borne
withal, and therefore that he must also bear with others. Again he will
consider too what end God has advanced him, namely to show other men the
way, and finally he will bear with himself least of all men. And hereby may
a man have a good incling too discern whether the admonitions proceed of pure
love, or whether they proceed of too much sternnesse. For if in rebuking
other men, a man take not heed to himself, and flatter not himself, ne cast
forth his choler to find fault with this man or that man's vice, but in the
mean while is utterly steyned himself, and would feign be plundged in it
over head and ears: it is certain that all is but hypocrisy. But when a man
reyneth himself short, and desires not to be more borne withal than his
neighbors: if therewithal he be rigorous, it is to be acknowledged that he
has the zeal of God, and of his holy spirit in him, and that he procures the
welfare of al men. Thus ye see in effect why Saint Paul says here, that he
intended to fashion himself to the Galathians. Now he adds further, that
they had not hurt or offended him in any thing, meaning thereby that he
undertook not any private quarrel against them. For the very things that
mar all when doctrine and Admonitions come to be put forth, are that either
we be of opinion that the party which speaks is not worthy too be
heard, or that we bear some hatred or pritch toward him ^^^ure hearts. For
it is impossible that we should take any thing in good part at his hand, when
we shall have conceived any such opinion or fancy of him. I see a man that
speaks as an Angel: now if I surmyze that he hates me, and seeks too byte
me, or that he goes about too discover my shame, surely I shall not take any
profit by heering of him. But this cannot excuze us: for it is a lewd fault:
and although it were true that a man hated us, and that he rebuked us upon
malice and spyte: yet ought we too learn too be conformable. The very
Heathen men could well enough say, that our foes did us sometimes more good
than our friends. For why, they that love one another will wink at many
things, and ouerpasse all without thinking amiss. But their enemies keep
watch to take advantage of them whom they mislyke, Pro. 26. d. 24.
and when they spy any fault, they miss not to blaze it abroad, as says
Solomon: yea and sometimes when they would feign fall out with a man, they
gyrde at him under pretense of giving him warning. Nevertheless when our
enimyes do so, surely God gives us a mean too bring us back again: for the
Devil may now and then serve the turn of a Physician toward us, according
as we have seen how Saint Paul says that he was buffeted by the same
Messenger, that is too wit, 2. Cor. 12. b. 7.
of Satan, which thing was done to beat down all pride in him. Therefore when
our enemies come too syft us after that fashion, and seek nothing else but too
find faults with us: God does by that means waken us, because we were
asleep before in our own flatteryes: and if we were wise and well advised,
surely our enemies should oftentimes do us more good than our friends, as I
said before, and as the Heathen men knew well enough. And it is a great shame
for us, that the blind wretches which were plunged in darkness, should see
more clearly than we that have the light of salvation, and that we should
not know the thing which those silly deccyued souls perceived. And yet
notwithstanding it is as (ye would sa) a piece of our nature, and men make
an ordinary rule of it, that if they have once taken any lewd conceyte that a
man hates them, they be so eagre and forepossessed with it, that they cannot
abide too receive any correction at his hand. For this cons^^^ration Saint
Paul protests here, that in reproving the Galathians, he deals not with
any case or quarrel of his own. We (says he) have bin friends
heretofore: I might perchance be dispyzed too the worldewarde, my coming
unto you was not with any great pomp, I was no painted fellow: but I brought
you the pure doctrine of the Gospel. And although I was a man without any
great gayness, so as I was not accounted of too the worldewarde: yet
notwithstanding, you received me as an Angel of God, yea even as Jesus Christ
himself: and whereof comes now this alteration? I hold on still in doing
my duty: and why then are you so alienated from me? See if ye can allege
any other thing, than that you hate Gods truth and cannot abide it. And what a
shame is it that ye should so hate Gods truth, that ye should disdeyne it
in my person because I am the Minister of it? Now then we have to gather
upon this Text, first that such as have the charge to teach and too carry
abroad the doctrine of the Gospel, must above all things eschew quarelles and
contentions, (at leastwyse if they intend to have their preaching to prevail
and be profitable) I say quarelles and contentions for their own peculiar
matters. And so ye see how we must abstain from all quar^lles, least the
gate be shette against us, and we be disbarred of all liberty of rebuking
men when need shall require, that we may protest with Saint Paul that we
deal not with them for any desire of revenge, enmity, or evil will, but
only for desire of their welfare, let us be sure of that, too the intent it
may open us a gappe, and give us a way too all manner of rebukings. Mark that
for one point.

Again, let us also be well aduized, that if our vices be touched, we cast
not a block in the way by conceyuing and surmising this false opinion in our
heads, that it is done of hatred: for that is the policy of Satan. Although
men be inclinable to think that other men do bite them and nip them of hatred:
yet let us not think that they do it of their own mere motion, but by the
Devils means, who snarleth them after that fashion. If we be rebuked when we
have done amysse, whence soever the same comes, surely it is a message sent
of God, because he will not have us too perish, but would have us to return
unto the right way, notwithstanding that the party which finds fault with us
do it not of a good and pure affection, but seeks only to spite us, or to
wreake his teene upon us: for yet does God nevertheless reach us his hand,
too the end we should not perish. But behold, Satan on the contrary part
stops us from receiving of the medicine, and puts us in the head, that
the rebuking of our faults comes not of good will, but that there is a pad in
the straw, so as we be either too much sifted, or too sore bitten, or else that
there is some other secret grudge lurking unseen. All these imaginations does
Satan mingle with men's admonitions, to the intent we should be out of love
with them, and refuze them, and by that means rebel against God. Wherefore
let us bear well in mind what is said here, to the end that when we be
warned of our faults, we may consider, that God, to the intent he would not be
our judge himself, appoynteth as it were attourneyes and solliciters in his
name, to come and charge us with our offenses. When a mortal man rebukes me
for my misdoings, it is Gods will he should do so, and he has appointed him
in his place. And too what end? That we should not come before his Majesty to
yield an account of them* for it were better for us too be drowned a hundred
thousand times. Gop then does pity us, when he sends us mortal men to
be our judges, yea even to be our judges to put us too some shame, and
thereby to stir us up afterward to return again into the right way.
Therefore whenever God is so merciful unto us: let us profit our selves by
such grace, and beware that we inuenim not our selves with opinions that come
incontinently in our heads, as that the party hates us, that he seeks us,
that there is some hartburning, that there is some enmity, and that there is I
wot not what. Let all this geere be trodden under foot, and let us accept
their warnings if they be true. To be short, if any man blame us, we cannot do
better, than to consider what our own conscience tells us of it. Mark this
for a special point, that we must not look what the person is that
speaks, nor pass whither there be any grudge or enmity in him: but only
what our own conscience judges of the matter and then must we needs
conclude, I am rightly reproved. It is a marvelous thing, that they which do so
chafe and storm and grind their teeth when they be rebuked, should
nevertheless condemn themselves continually whither they would or no, if they
entered into their own consciences, and yet had much lever to play the mad
bedlems against God, and too spite him by all means possible, than to humble
themselves in acknowledging their offenses. Ye see then that the way which we
have to keep when we be found fault with, is too harken unto such as may make
us too enter into account, and specially too have an eye too that which is in
us. And where shall we find that? Even written and engraven in our
consciences. And although we perceive it not thoroughly: yet let us mistrust
our selves, for noman is a co^petent judge in his own case as they say. True
it is that God does already make us judges in part: but yet must we rather
receive the condemnation which we perceive not, than carpe against it before
we have well and thoroughly weyed whither we be faulty or no. But there are
a number that are well apayde to shet up, or rather too seele up their eyes,
that they might not see their own shame: when a man comes to provoke them to
amendment, they fall to skirmishing at the first push, with, did they
ouershoote themselves so? And then all is dispatched, they will hear no further
of the matter, let a hundred things be proved against them, and all is nothing
with them. They do but wring their mouth awrie at it. For they would always
clear themselves, and although they be a laughing stock even too little
children, they pass not for it, but glory still of the hardening of themselves
in their own lewdness and filthiness. Therefore let us keep our selves from
falling into such wilful stubbornness: and in judging unfeignedly of our vices
according to truth, let us also be lowlyminded too humble our selves and to
beat down all pride in us, too the end that nothing may let us from
acknowledging freely that we have done amiss. This is the effect of that
which we have to remember upon this text. Now a man might think it strange
that S. Paul should say, that the Galathians had received him as an Angel of
God, yea or rather as Jesus Christ. For what perfection of holiness so ever
was in him, yet could he not match with the Angels, as we see how he
speaks in the seventh (...) the Romans, where he acknowledges himself too
be wretched, and shows that he is as a poor captive and slave of the world
under the bondage of sin. Although S. Paul had an earnest desire too serve
God: yet notwithstanding he knew he did but drag his legs after him, and that
he had many infirmities to pluck him back. And here he says that he was
received as an Angel: yea and he stays not there, but adds further, as
Jesus Christ, who (as we know) is the very Son of God, and highest King,
which has souerain power over all creatures. But here the case concerns
not Saint Paul's life, nor any worthiness that he pretends in himself. He
has an eye only to the doctrine. It is said first, that he was received as
an Angel of God. Mal. 2. b. 7.
And why not? For the same title has bin given too all such as have had
chardge too bear abroad the doctrine of the Law, and of much more reason
ought too be given to the publishers of the Gospel: for there God utters
his majesty and power, much more than he did in old time under the Law. For
as much then as God appoynteth mortal men to speak in his name and authority:
it is requisite that they should be acknowledged to be his Angels, that is to
say, Messengers or Ambassadors, for the word Angel betokens none other
thing. And in good sooth too what purpose were the doctrine which we here, if
it came not of God? It were much better that we [preachers] were dumb and
speechless, and that the heerers were deaf and blind, than to stand herkening
to a man that were not sent of God. For the chief honor that God requires at
our hands, is that we should be whist and harken to his word, yielding him all
authority, and holding our selves bridled and captive as under the royal
scepter whereunto he will have us too submit our selves. Now if a mortal
creature should usurp this to himself: what a thing were it? So then let us
mark well that S. Paul does justly compare himself with an Angel, as in
respect of his doctrine. And why? For he knew well enough he had not forged it
of his own brain, but had received it of God. And that also is the cause why
he adds, as Jesus Christ. For surely our Lord Jesus Christ will have us too
receive such as he ordeyneth too be his ministers, as if he himself were here
in visible shape among us. Luke. 10. c. 16.
He that he ereth you (says he) heereth me. (...) nevertheless it is
certain that he meant not too make idolles when he ordained his Apostles and
such as should be ministers of his word. He meant not that they should be
woorshipped in his steed: for out of all doubt, that pre-eminence is not to be
given to the very Angels of heaven: and what shall be done too us then,
which are but dung and rottenness? Howbeit, our Lord Jesus Christ regarded
not what manner of ones men are, but meant too advance his own word, too the
end that all men should submit themselves too it. Although then that we be
but as brittle earthen pottes, or rather already broken, so as we be nothing
worth: yet must not the treasure of the Gospel which we bear abroad be
therefore despyzed. For when Gods word is preached purely unto us, it is all
one as if he dwelte among us, and appeered personally unto us, and it behooves
us too give a proof of our fear, love and obedience toward him, by
receiving his word though it come out of a mortal man's mouth. And
furthermore if we hold skorne of the Gospel, under color and pretense that
they which speak unto us are another Kings nor Princes over us: let us assure
our selves that that rebelliousnesse of ours heaueth at our Lord Jesus
Christ. He that despyzeth you (says he) despyzeth me: and he that rejects
you rejects me. And this is well worth the marking. For we see now adays
that Gods word shall be so lightly esteemed under pretense of men's persons,
as it is dreadful too behold. And all such as are loath too be rebuked, will
by and by have this answer in their mouth: who are you Sir? who made you my
Prince? As who should say, that God had not superiority over us, nor might
speak too us by the mouth of his servant. A Prince may well enough send his
officer or some such man as he lists to chooze, and although the person be
of no countenance, yet will he have him received without doubting, and men do
so. And when God who has sovereign dominion! over us, and sole pre-eminence
over all the kingdoms and principalities of the world, sends us his servants
whom he auoweth, and will have us too give them the heering: if we
nevertheless do disdain the^, and in respect of their persons make none
account of the message that he sends us by them, and therewithal allege,
how now, is this fellow a (...): what a presumptuousnesse were that? If a man
carry abroad Gods word* faithfully, and tell men that whosoever despizeth it
sets and aduaunceth himself against God: what (say they)? this fellow makes
himself God. As who should say, that God might not speak by those whom he
has appointed to be his instruments: for as I have said heretofore, cursed
might we be if we bring our own inventions. It were much better that we
were drowned a hundred times, than that ever we should go up into the pulpet,
if we should not utter Gods will faithfully, and stick too that which he
commands us, and draw it out of the clear fountain of his holy word.
Should not these things be declared? Think we that God can be bereft of the
thing that is peculiar too him, that is too wit of his truth? No: he and his
truth can never be separated. So then let us abhor the blasphemies of these
naughtipackes which say, o, he that speaks will make himself a God. If he
require men too here him without gainsaying, namely when he is sure in himself
that he brings not any thing which is not of God, it is good reason that he
should commend the authority of his master. So then let us not have any
acquayntance with these worldlings: but let us yield such reverence to our God,
that although such as speak in his name be of no estimation, yet we may not
cease to obey the things that they set forth, with a true and lowly faith.
Yet nevertheless, we must also discern between those that pretend Gods name
falsely, and make a vain cloak of it, and those that be faithful dealers of
his word which he has committed unto them. Look me upon the Pope with his
whole kenell, who are not ashamed to say that whosoever heereth them heereth
Christ, and that he which rejects them rejects Christ: for they allege
that saying of Christ's, he that heereth you heereth me etc. too authorize
themselves withal. But they that will be received as Angels, must do the
duty of Angels, that is too say, they must be true messengers of God in
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ who has sent them, and they must hold all of
him, so as they serve him truly, and seek not soueraintie too themselves, but
that he may always be the shepeherd of the Church, and that the sheep of
his flock may here his voice, and follow him whither soever he calls the^.
And as for them that be false: (...), perverting the truth, and usurping
superiority too deface Gods word: it is meet that they should be taken for
such as they be in deed: and this has bin showed by that which I said at the
beginning: that is too wit, that whereas our Lord Jesus Christ has told us
that he will have us too here those that come in his name, as if he spoke in
his own person: he meant not thereby too make them idolles among men, too the
end that such as have charge to speak in his name, should be exalted too have
any tirannie: but he meant that his word should be received reverently and
without gaynsaying. And whereas S. Paul says here that he was received as
an Angel, or rather as Jesus Christ: it is as much to say as he came not in
his own name, but indeuered too preach Gods grace purely, and too make men too
follow Jesus Christ, and to frame themselves wholly unto him, that he might
have his due pre-eminence, that the Gospel might be received without
gaynsaying, and that it might bring forth such fruit as it ought too do: Romans
1. b. 16.
that is to wit, that it might be the power of God too the salvation of all
believers, as it is said in the beginning of the Epistle too the Romans.

Now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we may be moved
more and more to amendment, and that it may please him to bear with our
infirmities, till he have rid us quite and clean of all, and so renewed us
according too his own image, so as all may be pure and clean in us, and his
glory show it self there, and we more and more fight in such wise against our
own sinfulness, as it may be utterly emptied out of us, and he so fill us
with the grace of his holy spirit, as we may draw others thereunto, so as all
of us may with one common consent indeuer to serve to his glory, and give over
our selves wholly thereunto. And so let us all say, Almighty God heavenly
father, etc.

The. 28. Sermon, which is the fifth upon the fourth Chapter.
15 Where is then your blissednesse? for I bear you witness, that if it had
(...) possible, you vvoulde have plucked out your eyes, and given them unto me.

16 Am I then become your enemy because I tell you the truth?

17 They be ielous over you, [hovvbeit] not for [any] good. Nay rather they
meene to shet you out, too the end you should be fond of them.

18 It is good too be alvvayes earnest minded in good things, and not only
when I am present with you.

19 My little children of whom I travel in birth again till Christ be
fashioned in you.

20 I would I were with you now and could change my voice, for I stand in
doubt of you.


We need no teaching to seek the thing which we think to be good and
profitable for us: for every man is inclined to that by nature, yea and too
much given unto it. But the mischief is, that we know not the true profit from
the thing that is harmfull, but are oftentimes so blinded with our foolish
lusts, that every of us overthrows himself wilfully. Not that we forget the
thing which I said to be imprinted in our hearts: but for that we be carried
away by our unruly lusts, or else so bleared with the vanities of this world,
that we have no discretion at all to judge rightly. And therefore we ought to
flee unto God continually so much the more, that he may give us skill to
discern what is good for us, to the intent we may serve him, and have our
minds so wholly set upon him, as we may never be removed: specially for so much
as it oftentimes falls out, that such as are taken to be very wise to the
worldward, become like little children according to the alteration of their
desires, giving up the things which they had set much store by, and gadding
after some pelting trifle that comes in their sight, so as there is no stay
at all in them. Sometimes we shall see a chief run after three or four at
once, and if there come a thing, that he fought for he catches at that by and
by: and anon after if he spy an apple or a cherrie, or some other thing that
likes him, he leaves all the residue too run after that. Even so play we: no
doubt but we always think our selves wise enough, and we take scorn too be
taught at any man's hand, or too be warned what is good for us, for it
seems too us too be an offering of wrong too us: but yet experience shows
that we want both wit and reason. For what is the cause that men do so toss
and turmoyle themselves out of measure, and yet run astray all their life
long? As I said before, all of us with one common accord hold this principle,
that we desire too seek our own profit, there is another great nor small but
he is inclined unto that. But let us see wherevntoo men apply their minds:
there is not that man whose affections boil not within him, in so much that ye
shall see the greatest number (as ye would say) rack themselves, and their
minds never cease day nor night too run still upon the things that come
before them, whereby they hope for any profit. And when they have well
tormented themselves, a man shall scarsly find one among a thousand that has
his affections well ordered: in so much that it were much better for them too
be a sleep all the time of their life, than too take so much travel without
knowing why or wherefore. Now then seeing that the most part of us are proved
not to discern betwixt good and evil as were requisite and expedient, we
have need to submit our selves unto God, praying him too guide us by his holy
spirit. And specially when the sovereign felicity or welfare comes in
question, surely whereas we should be carried away and ravished in love with
it: we be haled another way, and do nothing but fiske too and fro, and there
is so great inconstancy and lightness in us, that the thing which we love
more dearly than our life too day, shall be as good as despyzed too morrow.
And that also is the cause why Saint Paul does in this text vpbrayde the
Galathians with their forgetting of their own happiness. Math. 6. c. 21.
For this saying of our Lord Jesus Christ's, that look where a man's treasure
is there is his heart also, is taken of the common order of nature. He terms
that thing our treasure, which we set most store by, and whereupon we do wholly
repose our selves: for there are many things which men do well like of, the
which nevertheless they can easly find in their hearts too forbear. Though a
man see a fair and costly thing, yet can he content himself quietly with his
own state still, if he have wherewith too maintain himself. But if we
esteem our life unhappy or unfortunate without the inioying of any welfare at
all, surely we shall be tossed with continual unquietness, till we have
obtained it: and that does common experience show well enough. Seeing then that
our hearts must needs be tied too the thing which we take too be requisite
too our chief felicity, let us now see how every man behaueth himself. Such
as are given to the flightfull goods of this world, or are so inflamed with
ambitiousnesse and desire of honor, that they seek nothing else but too
magnify themselves, and too be in some high degree and great estate, that
they might be had in estimation: will always labor for the same. Such as are
possessed with covetousness, will never leave gathering of goods, nor never
be satisfied with any thing. They endure hunger and thirste, heat and cold,
and dare another eat nor drink half their fill, and all too the intent to
heap up out of measure. Lo at what point they be. Again, such as covet to
be esteemed and exalted too the worldward, endure as great misery as if they
were in the hands of the hangman: nay, the hangman would not torment them so
cruelly as they do themselves: and yet they be so headstrong, as they cannot
by any means be turned from it. But when God is so gracious as to show us
where our welfare lies, that is to wit, in the kingdom of heaven: although
we be warned that our life is of no continuance, and that we slip away out of
hand: yet are we so ravished in love with our vanities, that we forsake the
inestimable joy whereunto God calls us, and set light by the heritage of
heaven, in comparison of these worldly things which are right naught. Therefore
let us consider, that S. Paul's present vpbrayding of the Galathians when he
asks them where their happiness is become, touches and concerns us now
adays. For he presupposes that the Galathians knew that God could not have
done them a greater good turn in this world, than to inlighten them with the
knowledge of his Gospel, whereby they had bin thoroughly persu^^d and resolved,
that the world has nothing but deceitfulness in it, for so much as it turns
us away from the heritage of heaven, according also as our Lord Jesus Christ
alleges the same similitude, Math. 13. f. 44.
that the Gospel and the treasures and riches contained therein are a precious
stone, and that if we should give over all the things which we esteem in this
world, and which we like best of, we should lose nothing by the bargain, nor
have any cause to repent us. But now are we dubble too blame, seeing we turn
away after we have known that God drew us from beneath to make us partakers of
his heavenly glory, and put that inestimable benefyte out of our remembrance
for the whisking of a fly overthwart our eyes as they say. For as much then as
it has pleased God to open our eyes, and too pluck us out of the mire wherein
we were plunged with the vnbleeuers and ignorant persons, not only in following
superstitions and idolatries as others did, but also in giving ourselves over
to our fleshly likings and wicked lusts: and seeing that God has made us to
perceive where our true joy lies, and given us such a taste of it as we ought
to rest wholly upon it: let us take good heed that we never change our
purpose, nor alter our mind hereafter. And if we do: let us consider how the
spirit of God does here condemn us of unthankfulness by the mouth of Saint
Paul, saying, Where is your happiness? For had we bin always let alone like
brute beasts without knowing wherein our welfare and joy consist, it had bin no
marvel though we had still kept on our common trace. But seeing that God has
showed us that we must seek all our welfare in our Lord Jesus Christ, and
that he is the full perfection in whom we must wholly rest: if we do afterward
fleet too and fro and be shaken now one way and now another: it is certain
that we can no more excuse ourselves by ignorance. Ye see then that the thing
which we have too bear in mind in this text, is that when we have once bin
taught the Gospel, we must set light by the things that we made too great
account of before, and which men covet without end or measure: that is to wit
by the allurements of Satan and of the world, and by all transitory and
flightfull things which have no substantialnesse in them and continually seek
our Lord Jesus Christ, till we come to the full enjoying of all the benefyt^
which he has brought us. And now herevppon S. Paul blames the Galathians
yet further, that he cannot be their enemy but for telling them the truth. For
it is too great a leawdnesse to fall out with our freende, only for showing
himself faithful toward us. What is the thing that we should chiefly
desire in a friend, but that he should deal roundly with us, and not bear two
faces in one hood, nor use any craft and untruth toward us? Every man can tell
that welynough, and it is as a natural lesson which we know without schooling:
and yet notwithstanding we be grieved and displeased with them that tell us the
truth, and by that means do work our weal: and therefore must it not needs
be that we are bewitched of Satan, if we step up against them and become their
enemies? Saint Paul then shows the cause of his fear that they should be
alienated from him, and blames the^ that they were become his enemies, for
none other cause than that he had dealt soundly and roundly with them. Now
although this vice be horrible, and all men condemn it: yet is it as common as
any other nowadayes in the world. For what else mainteineth friendship, but
lying, flattering, dissimulation, counterfetting, and such other like things?
In so much that if a man go roundly to work, he shall purchase himself hatred
and ill will on all sides. And the very cause of the greatest contentions and
debates that are nowadayes in the world, is that men stop their ears against
all truth and reason: for we would feign have all things buried that might
mislike us: Therefore this was not written for the Galathians only, but is to
be applied still at this day to the common instruction of all such, as cannot
abide that men should deal faithfully and truly with them. For let every of
is look upon himself and examine himself well, and he shall find that all
of us are atteinted with that vice, till God have purged us of it. So then let
us assure ourselves that if we grieve such as tell us the truth, in so doing
we despise God, and fall out with him rather than with the men. We will
protest the clean contrary: nevertheless we do but lie, when we cannot endure
that God should bewray the thing that we would have concealed, I meene, that he
should discover our faults, and rebuke them, and hold us in awe, and not bear
with any thing that is not lawful for us. Thus (...) see in effect what we
have to mark upon this text. Now heerevppon Saint Paul labors too win the
Galathians by great ge^tlenesse. My little Babes (says he) of whom I travel
in birth again, till our Lord Jesus Christ be fashyoned in you. Howbeit,
although that his words be somewhat sweet, yet does he not fail to sauce them
a little to the intent to quicken them up, by calling them little babes,
telling them that whereas they ought too have bin fashioned and borne long ago,
yea and to have bin growe^ to man's estate in Jesus Christ, he wist not what too
make of them. For you drive me so to my shifts (says he) that I cannot tell
what speech I may use toward you any more: and therefore seeing you be so
strange and untoward, and so fickle to be dealte with that I cannot tell how
to handle you, I must feign to transform my self into a new man. Lo how he
uses a manner of speech mingled with rigor and great freendlinesse. And he
is not contented too take upon him only the person of a father, whose love
notwithstanding is tender enough toward his children: but he likeneth
himself also too a mother that is toward her travel and full of throws,
who (notwithstanding all the peines that she feels) is more charie over the
child that is to come out of her womb, tha^ she is of her own bowels and
life. When Saint Paul used this similitude, it is certain that he wist not
how to show himself more affectioned toward them, to the intent to break,
or at leastwise to soften the hardness that was in them to whom he spoke. But
yet whatsoever come of it, he is flat with them in vpbrayding them with their
leawdnesse, in that they acknowledged not their mother that bare them and
nurrished them with the substance of her own blood, but for all the
gentleness that he used toward them, became as wild beasts that could not
be tamed: and that was an outrageouse unkindness. And so we see how Saint
Paul does continually follow the mean that I told you of to day: which is
that to the uttermost of his power, he laboreth too bring those back again
by louingnesse, which were gone out of the way. And to that end he tells
them, that he has a greater care of their welfare, than they would think. But
yet howsoever the case stand, he mingleth their oil with tart vinegar, which
quickened them up as need was, least they should fal^^^sleepe in their sins.
For it is no cockering of such as have offended God, and are as good as
poisoned or rather bewitched by Satan, so as they perceive not their own
filthiness: All such geere must be razed out. And therefore, hap what hap
will, he holds such an even hand, as they must needs perceive that he
procures their welfare, and that all his seeking is to bring them unto God.
This in effect is the thing that we have to mark upon this text. Howbeit we
have also too mark particularly, that when Saint Paul terms them little
babes, he vpbraydeth them closely for that they had profited no better. For to
what purpose is the Gospel daily preached unto us? 1. Pe. 1. d 23.
It is said to be the incorruptible seed whereby we be begotten again to be
the children of God. Now when we come into the world, we grow by nurrishment of
milk, and from time too time become stronger, so as at length we feed no
more upon milk, but use substantialler food, whereby we gather force and
strength more and more, till we come to man's state. Now then, what a thing were
it if after we have bin made new creatures by means of the Gospel, we will
needs hang still upon the dugge, and have so little prospered, that we must
still be lulled in arms, and be not able too swallowe a piece of bread, but
will needs be still muzzling at the teate? Does this proceed of the nature
of the Gospel? No surely: and therefore we must acknowledge the fault to be
in ourselves.

So then whe^eas Saint Paul calls the Galathians little babes, although he
do therein show an earnest love toward them: yet does he sting them also,
according also as we see how the Apostle in the Epistle to the Hebrews says:
Heb. 5. c. 12.
How now? You ought to be great Clearkes considering the long time that you
have gone to school: for this is not the first day that the Gospel has bin
preached unto you, and yet you be still at your apcie: and what a shame is
that? For God has done the office of a good schoolmaster toward you and
taught you sufficiently: and you on your part have played the trewands: and so
what will now become of you? For S. Paul had long time bin delivered of the
Galathians in Jesus Christ, and they ought to have bin grown strong in the
faith of the Gospel. But behold, they be still nouices and raw scholars, yea
and so brutish as they wot not whereunto to ^^icke, nor what to follow. That
is the first point. And now consequently he adds: that he traueleth of them
in birth new again. He had bin brought abed of them before: howbeit, that was
as ye would say before their time. Not that he had not given them all that was
requisite for their instruction: but for that they were not able to receive it,
because they were still too much given to their earthly lusts and likings. 1.
Cor. 2. d. 14.
Now we know that the sensual man comprehends not the secrets of God.
Therefore we must be discharged of our own nature, that we may be renewed in
God: and the thing which we call Regeneration, that is to say new birth or
second birth, does us to wit that the old man which is in us, must be
mortifyed and as it were changed. For as much then as the Galathians had not
given place to the doctrine of the Gospel: therefore Saint Paul says that
he must be feign to be with child with them again, yea even till Jesus
Christ be fashioned in you says he. This saying is added to sweeten that
which was somewhat sour of itself. For what a shame was it that they which had
received the earnest pennye of their salvation in baptim, and in the Lords
supper, (as there were many of them both men and women that had bin taught at
the age of twenty, thirty, fifty, or threescore years) after protestation
made before God that they were fully renewed in Jesus Christ, should need to be
as it were new molten, cast, and fashioned again? And in that respect Saint
Paul says, till Jesus Christ be fashioned in you. As if he should say, I
marvel that you should be still as little babes, and that I should be forced
(as ye would say) to receive you again into my womb and bowels, till the time
came that ye might be riper than you have hitherto bin: and yet am I afraid
also least the peine and travel that I have taken among you be lost and
misspent, and that you be not so well shaped and fashioned as were to be
desired. Thus ye see breefly how Saint Paul mitigateth the rigor that
might have bin too great, and have wounded the Galathians too sore, when he
said unto them, What? Ye be as it were borne before your time: I thought I
had conceived you, bred you, borne you, and brought you up in Jesus Christ, and
I see now there is no life in you, at leastwise no spiritual life, and that
all is slipped and vanished away. If Saint Paul had stayed there: surely
those wretched people had bin driven to confusion and utter despair. Therefore
to give them courage to return again, he says: Go too, truly ye have
profited very ill hitherto: but enter new again into the right way, and let
that which seems to be stark dead bring forth new fruit again, and let it
be perceived that your protesting too walk according to the Gospel
heretofore, has not bin vain. For like as if a tree be as good as dead, and
seem to be utterly withered, it will spring again if a man put new earth to
the root of it and cherish it: so will it fall out that a man which is quite
strayed away from the Gospel, shall not only be as it were eftsoons begotten
new again, if he be brought back again into the way: but also the thing
that he had received before shall do him good, as is to be seen wheresoever God
gives the grace too bring those back again intoo the right way which were
strayed from it. But surely that happens not too all men: and therefore let
us beware that we abuse not Gods goodness, as many of these skoffers do,
which turn away as though they had confederated themselves with Satan,
whereof we see examples in these folk that defyle and vnhalow themselves, and
deface Gods truth to the uttermost of their power. And if any man turn away
through inconstancy, it seems that all is marred, and some will say, what
shall a man win by teaching of them? behold, he is but a lost child: and so
they will conclude that there is not one drop of good knowledge in them. But if
God call them again, as there are many such examples to be seen: a man shall
find that the thing which was as good as choked and overwhelmed before,
sprouteth again, like as if dung were cast upon a well tilled ground, or as
if dust and such other things were strowed upon it, that which is underneath it
should lie hid for a time, but afterward it would shoot up again. This in
effect is the thing that Saint Paul meant to tell us here. But by the we way
we have to mark, that whereas he says that Jesus Christ shall be fashioned
in them new again it is meant condicionally that they return under his
obeisance. Surely this saying might seem somewhat harsh at the first sight:
for we be rather fashioned in Jesus Christ, than he in us. For proof whereof,
behold, Jesus Christ is our full and whole perfection. Now, too say that he is
nurrished in us as a little babe, or that he grows or is furthered: is not
seemly for his person. Nevertheless Saint Paul says so: howbeit, that is
but too show the union that is betwixt us and Jesus Christ our head. Although
then that Jesus Christ can neither increace nor diminish in himself: yet does
he take all our faults and infirmities upon him. I have told you already
that we are then borne in him, when we be called too the hope of salvation by
the doctrine of the Gospel: for we be all dead and damned in Adam. There is
but one mean of life, which is, to be made one with our Lord Jesus Christ,
who is the fountain that has all fullness in it, and whereoutof it behooves
us too draw. Then we are borne in Jesus Christ (as I said before:) so does he
suckle us with the doctrine of his Gospel, till we be able too receive
perfecter learning, and till our faith be so far forward, that we resemble
little babes no more, but increace still in profiting more and more, till we be
come to man's age, as Saint Paul says in the fourth to the Ephesians.
Furthermore to the end we may know that our Lord Jesus Christ intends not
to be separated from us, but that he and we be all one: he says that he
takes our faults upon him, and becomes as a little babe in us. How so? Can
Jesus Christ be weak? No, not in respect of himself: but for as much as we be
members of his body, he says he is little in us in respect of the little
knowledge of him which we have. And for as much as we proceed still further
and further: he says also that he grows and is increased in us. Lo here a
record of excellent goodness, yea of the infinite goodness of Gods son, in
that it pleases him so to abace himself, as not only too have compassion and
pity of our infirmities, too relieve them and remedy them: but also
transformeth himself, and is contented too say that he is as it were
imperfect, and as a little babe, and that he grows greater and greater
according too the continual increasing of our faith. Ephesians. 1. d. 23
And here ye see also why in another place Saint Paul calls the Church
the fullness of God and of his son our Lord Jesus Christ. But surely if we
imagine that God is not thoroughly full and perfect in himself, but that he
has need too borrow of us: it is rank trayterousnesse: for what are we able
to give unto him? When he shall have gathered us all before him, what can he
find in us but utter misery? For we be plunged, yea and utterly saped in it.
Yet notwithstanding he tells us by the mouth of Saint Paul, that we be his
accomplishment, and that in that respect he is after a sort imperfect. Not that
he could not be without us. for he has bin always everlastingly, before he
had created the world. And although there were another heaven nor earth, could
not God be satisfied with himself? Were he nor rich enough of his own
glory? Yes surely: but he will not be perfect nor fully satisfied til he have
us knit in one with him. Thus ye see what we have to mark upon this text. And
by this word Fashion we be warned, that it not enough for us to have some
slight knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ: but that he must be so lively shaped
in us to the full, as we may have such a print of his power, of all his
graces, and of all his benefytes graven in our hearts, as may never be blotted
out or defaced again. He said heretofore, that when the Gospel is preached
with such efficacy as belongs unto it, Jesus Christ is after a sort crucified
among us: in so much that we not only see him peinted lively before us, but it
is as much as if we saw him upon the Cross, with his blood streaming down, as
though he were presently offering up the everlasting sacrifise to God his
father, to wash away all our offenses and misdeedes. Now like as God shows us
that favor: so let us on our side beware that we let not the thing slip that
is set before us, as many folk do, who when they have gotten the understanding
of a two or three words of the Gospel, do fall to flourishing, and think
themselves to have too much, whereas notwithstanding they have but a confused
imagination. Therefore it is not to be wondered at, though they be utterly at
their wits ends in every temptation be it never so small, so as all that they
ween themselves to have learned, serves them to no purpose: for God does by
that means punish their negligence. Wherefore, in as much as God has
granted us the grace to know his son: let the foresaid representation be
printed in us as often as we come to any Sermon, and let us be renewed in
knowledge and remembrance: that when the Devil shall labor to darken, and
finally to deface the faith which we shall conceive, he may gain nothing at
our hands because we have the lively impression [of Christ's sacrifize] so
deeply graven in our hearts, as it may well be said that he is truly and
thoroughly fashioned in us. And herein it to is be seen, that the Papists have
utterly renounced our Lord Jesus Christ: For they cokes the world, saying that
it is enough too have a confused faith, and that men must not be too
inquisitiue, and that it is perlous for men to indeuer themselves to profit in
the Gospel. Behold their blasphemies. But here we see how S. Paul tells
the Galathians, that it is a great shame for them that Jesus Christ Christ
should be fashioned new again in them, saying that it is all one as if they
were doted, and had not received the doctrine as they ought too have done which
had bin preached among them. Therefore if we do our duty and be as good
scholars too Godwarde, as he is a good and faithful scholemaister toward us:
surely we shall not have an entangled faith of some confused imagination, 2
Cor. 3. d. 18.
but we shall behold the son of God as he is spoken of the Corinthians,
where it is said that the Gospel is the true looking glass wherein we
behold Jesus Christ as it were in the face. Not that we see him with our eyes,
for that is reserved to the last day, at what time we shall be like unto God.
As then his glory shall be fully discoured unto us: but as now we behold
our Lord Jesus Christ in the Gospel so far forth as is meet for us, and as
our weakness and rudeness will bear, that we may be transformed and
fashioned like unto him. And whereas S. Paul adds, that he would feign be
with the Galathians, to change his speech because he was sorry for them:
therein he bewrays ageine how gross and intolerable their fault is, sith
he woteth not at which end too begin with them, and that although he have bred
them in Jesus Christ, and fed them up with the doctrine of the Gospel, yet he
knows not how to rule them any more, whereas notwithstanding, a mother ought
to know the complexion and nature of her child. Needs then must those men
be utterly froward and leaudmynded, whose fathers and mothers are at their
wits end and wot not how to behave themselves: and when their children are
become either serpents full of poison, or Lions full of pride and
stubbornness, so as they be past teaching or handling: it must needs be that
they are become feendes. And yet does S Paul upbraid the Galathians with it.
Howbeit, in stead of blaming them, let us see if the like vice be not to be
found in us: namely that when God opens his mouth to teach us, he find us
so fickle-headed, that he must be feign to alter his speech at every turn. It
is true that he can welinough weeld our hearts when it shall please him. But we
treat not here of his secret power whereby he works in his chosen. We
treat here but only of our own nature, how beastly it is if it be considered
in it self, and of the preaching of the Gospel. Are not they that would preach
the doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ faithfully, stricken continually in
heaviness to see men so beastly as they show them selves to be? For our
tasting of the goodness of our God ought to tame us. Surely we ought to give
good ear to his doctrine: and if we could be drawn unto him by gentleness,
or if we would be warned with every little beckening of his finger, like the
child that seeks too please his father, who as soon as his father does but
speak the word, has his feet ready out of hand too run whither soever
his father sends him, and both his hands ready to do whatsoever he
commands him: he should not need to use long process with us. But when God
speaks to us, we be so dulwitted as we wot not what he meeneth: or else we
stop our ears, that cry he never so loud, it is to no purpose, for we abide
always at one point. Therefore the thing that S. Paul has spoken in this
text, serves not for any one people alone: but it is all one as if he blamed
the whole world in all ages for unthankfulness, saying that God is after a
sort grieved with us for being so crooked and froward, and for the great
number of lurking holes and hypocrisies that are in us: in so much that if he
use us gently, we become so much the more sturdie: and if he handle us
roughly, we kick against the spur. And in good soothe we see what his
gentleness and roughness avail us: that is to wit, so little, that our
lewdness must needs be ouergreat, seeing he can not win us by the one nor
by the other. Therefore let us bethink our selves thoroughly. Furthermore
forasmuch as God is willing to beget us by his word, to the end we should be
his children, and in the end obtain inheritance whereunto he has adopted us by
our Lord Jesus Christ, and which he has purchased for us by the death and
passion of him that is the true and only heir: as often as we come to Sermons,
or any of us read the holy Scripture, let us consider to what end it serves.
And moreover, if we find not such power and efficacy in Gods word when we
hear it preached or read: let us blame our own naughtiness or dullness for
it, assuring our selves that the world does still hold us back and hinder us
too much: and let us pray God that his word may not be unprofitable to us.
Besides this, when we be once reformed by it, so as we are become his children:
let us daily feed upon it, assuring our selves that we have need of it all
the time of our life, and that we be not yet come to the perfection whereunto
we must tend. Wherefore let that stir us up, and let us always be
earnestly minded to go still forward, till we stick fast too our Lord
Jesus Christ, and let us take good heed that we do not stop and shet up the
passage that he should have to us, 2. Cor. 6. c. 12.
to guide and govern us to our safety. And this is the very same thing which
we have seen S. Paul vpbrayde the Corinthians with, namely that he could not
come at them: and why? It was not long of me, says he. VVherof then? Even of
your own ouerstrayghtnesse and shrinking back: and because ye submit not your
selves to God, but rather draw from him, or else shrink back into your
lurking holes: I am feign to talk to you, now in one speech and now in
another. So then according to his vpbrayding of the Corinthians there, and of
the Galathians still here, let us beware that we be not so streightlaced as we
be of our own nature: but let us pray God to give us access to his word. And
seeing that all our lusts, our sinful vanities, and our froward affections
are as bars, gates, and such other things cast in the way, too the intent
that Gods word should not pass: let us fight against them, let it not only
enter in unto us as at a creuis, but let it find the gate wide open, and when
soever God speaks, let us give good ear, and open our hearts and minds, to
receive the doctrine rightly and roundly, whereby we should be cleansed, till we
be come to the fountain of all clennesse.

But now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our fau^^s, praying him too make us so to feel them, as we
may condemn our selves, not only with our mouths, but also with a true
meening heart, and fight valeantly against all our vices, forsaking our selves
more and more, and laboring to rid us quite and clean of them, and of all the
corruption and sinfulness that is in us, till he have drawn us fully to
himself, and that we be so transformed to the likeness of his image, as we
may enjoy his immortal glory, whereunto he now allureth us, and which we can
not possess as yet but in hope, until the latter day. That it may please him
to grant this grace, not only to us, but also to all people and nations of
the earth, bringing back all ignorante souls from the miserable bondage of
error and darkness, to the right way of salvation. etc.

The.xxix. Sermon, which is the sixth upon the fourth Chapter.
21 Tell me you that would be under the Law, here ye not the Law?

22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bond woman,
and the other by a free woman.

23 And he that was by the bond vvoma^ was borne after the flesh: but he that
was of the free woman was borne by promise.

24 Which things are spoken by an Allegory: for they be two Couenaunts. The
one from mount Sina which ingendreth unto bondage, which is Agar.

25 For Agar is mount Sina in Arabie, and represents that which is now
called Jerusalem, and is in bondage with her children.


EVery man can say that freedom is a thing so greatly to be desired, that ma^s
life is as it were half dead, or a continual pininig away without it. And in
very deed we shun bondage and subjection as much as is possible, and seek
freedom and liberty, according also as it is named an inestimable benefit in
the common Proverb. Now if it be so in respect of this earthly life: Much
more is it so when it stands upon the everlasting salvation of our souls.
But we see that many run into bondage, and tie the rope about their own
necks wilfully. They can well inoughe say that they desire freedom: but in
the mean while they show them selves too have as it were vowed them selves
unto slavery. And this is specially seen and tried to much when we come too
the enjoying of the freedom which is purchased us by our Lord Jesus Christ,
too the end that our souls should have rest. For although God set us free
from the bonds of Satan, and from tyranny of sin, by the Gospel, in
telling us that he adopteth us too be his children: yet do we scarsly see
any that accept that benefit when it is offered them, but all do plunge them
selves into the cursed captivity of sin, and had lever to be subject to
their own lusts, than too walk at liberty by yielding them selves to the
obeying of God. Not without cause therefore does S. Paul reprove here the
unthankfulness of such as long to be under the law, telling them that they
forsake the thing which they ought most chiefly to wish for, that is, to be
frank and free as the children of God. And here of he gives us as it were a
looking glass or lively picture, saying that even in the Law it self a man
may perceive how wretched and miserable man's state is, so long as he abides
under the Law. For Abraham's house was as a lively image of Gods Church. There
therefore we may see what the state of the Church is. Now it is said that
Abraham had two sons: the one named Ismaell; Genesis 16. a. 1.
and the other named Isaac. Ismael was borne of Agar which was Abraham's
handmayd, and had bin given him to wife. Howbeit there was a foul fault in
that he could not discharge the promise and bond that he had made to his
lawful wife Sara. Again, we see that the cause of this marriage between
Abraham and Agar, happened through the overmuch hastiness of Sara, because she
thought that God forslowed the performance of his promise so long, and she was
desirous to have issue. But she thought that that could not come to pass by
her own means, and therefore she made a very evil construction upon Gods word,
and it apereth that she was not so pacient and well stayed in her faith as was
requisite. To be short the marriage was to be condemned, and no better than
whordome, howbeeit that Abraham's intent was not so. For he was not led with
wicked lust. He might very well have desired to have had the seed whereof the
salvation of the world should spring: but see what our foolish intents do.
When we attempt one thing or other without having Gods word for our warrant,
we shall be carried and led into many faults through our own rashness. After
this manner is Ismaell borne of Agar the bondwoman, and yet is that no Lawful
marriage nor allowed of God. Isaac is borne of Sara long time after Ismaell: for
Ismaell might well have bin sixteen year old ere Isaac was borne. But Saint
Paul followyng the record of Moses, says that Isaac was borne by promise,
and Ismaell after the flesh. Not that Abraham begat not his son Isaac: but
that he did it by power from heaven, because his body was already withered and
as good as half dead, and he had not any more lustiness in him. He was a man
of a hundred years old, and his wife also pricked much about the same age, who
had bin barrein all the foretime of her life, and was full fourscore and ten
years old or thereabouts ere she might conceive and be with child, in so much
that eue^ she her self also thought it to be but a tale and a laughing matter,
when the message was brought him by the Angels. Ge. 18. b. 12.
Ye see then that Isaac was borne by promise. For in that case God wroughte by
miracle, too the end it might be known that our Lord Jesus should be sent
into the world, not after the common order of nature, but as proceeding of
Gods goodness and wonderful forepurpose. But howsoever the case stand, ye
see here in the house of Abraham (who is as it were a figure and image of the
Church) two women with their two children borne of either of them one. Now as
t^^ching Agar, S. Paul says that she represents mount Sinay where the Law
is given: and he calls it a mountain of Arabie, to show that it was not in
the holy land which God had appointed to be the inheritance of his people. Also
Sara represents Jerusalem: not the Jerusalem (says he, which is now
standing, for that was corrupted and gone away from the law and pure doctrine
of God: I say from the law, not after the manner that S. Paul takes it here
to engender unto bondage: but according to the covenant that God had made with
his people in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. For as much then as the
Jerusalem which was in S. Paul's time, had forsaken Jesus Christ, and by that
means disanulled Gods covenant: S. Paul says that it must be coupled with
Agar or mount Sinay. It is to no purpose (says he) that the Jews make their
brags under color of their Temple, Sacrifices and such other things, that they
be Gods chosen and peculiar people: for notwithstanding all that geere, yet
are they as good as banished and rooted out of the holy land, and have no more
but a vain title of the law. For let a man look upon the state of Jerusalem
as it is now to be seen, and it differs nothing at all from Sinay. But there
is a Jerusalem from above (says he*) that is to wit, the Church, which
breeds us before God, and she having the incorruptible seed of the Gospel,
bears children that are free and unbound, and she is the mother of all the
faithful, according as it is written, Esa. 54. a. 1.
Rejoice thou poor barein woman. And Esaias speaks not to any one woman: but
terms Gods Church so by a similitude, which Church should for a time be
greatly scattered. His saying then is, very well, thou shall be an ofcast, and
there shall be as it were a kind of divorce between God and thee: but in the
end he will multiply thee again, and thou shall have mo children than if
thou had flourished of all the while in prosperity: and that came to pass
when the Gospel was preached openly too the world. For then the Church had not
only the children of Abraham, or some one certain people: but through the
heavenly seed of the Gospel, she brought forth infinite children unto God,
of all Nations and Countries, far and wide, according to the power which God
uttered through the whole world. Lo here in effect the substance of the text
which I (...) rehearsed. But first of all we have to mark, that whereas S.
Paul says, that these things are spoken by an Allegory: he meant not too
impeache the natural sense of the holy Scripture, as we see how some have
done, who through their foolish curiosity of seeking fond speculations in
the holy Scripture, have turmoyled and disordered all things, esteeming the
literal sense to be nothing worth. This was the cause that all things were
falsified and perverted, and there has not bin a more diuelishe device than
these allegories, which have borne such sway in the world, and as yet still
delight many men so much, that they be as it were bewitched with them, because
they be very favorable and plausible. O noble exposition, say they. And why
so? Because that when as it touches neither heaven nor earth, the silly
people are ravished at it, and it is an easy matter too hang in suspense and
mamering at it. But Saint Paul mente not that the things which Moses
reports of Isaac and Ismaell, should only serve for such curious
speculations: but he shows that in that story we see in effect the state
of the Church, because that at that time there was no Church in the world
governed by God, but only the house of Abraham. There was as yet Salem where
Melchisedeck was king: How be it for as much as the same went still too
decay, God gathered a people in the person of Abraham, whereby he gave an
incling, that he would be called upon by those whom he had sholed out from
the rest of the world. Therefore we must not read this story of Moses
coldly without looking any further, that is too say, without consideration of
the things that happened in that house, wherein the state of the Church is
showed us. Mark that for one point. But now too come too the principal, let
us mark that whereas Saint Paul likeneth Agar Abraham's bond woman unto
mount Sinay, and unto the Law that was published there: he meeneth not the
Law with the whole contents and substance of it. For in the Law there are
promises of salvation, which we must hope for by our Lord Jesus Christ, as
Saint Paul declares in diverse places, and as we our selves have seen. Then
if we could take the Law in his right and lawful use, it is certain that
we should have there the^ corruptible seed of life, and God would be our
father, and we should be set free by him. The law in deed has engendered
unto bondage as in outward respect, as has bin declared heretofore. Although
the fathers of old time were Gods children and heirs of the kingdom of
heaven as well as we: yet were they under tutors and gouerners. For they were
as yet like little children, and the perfection of things was reserved to the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: and the Ceremonies were as brydles and
thongs, so that they which kept them had not the full freedom that God
grants us to enjoy now adays as it is purchaced for us by our Lord Jesus
Christ. Yet notwithstanding S. Paul speaking here of the Law that
ingendereth unto bondage, takes it for the false opinion which they had
against whom he disputes. For he will add anon, that all such as are so
engendered, shall in the end be banished and driven out of Gods house and
heritage. Now although the fathers were engendered in outward bondage, as is
said of them in the viij. to the Romans: yet were they free by the spirit of
faith, which over ruled the bondage, or else they had bin cut of from all hope
of salvation. To be short, S. Paul speaks here of the law, after the
interpretation wherewith it had bin corrupted by the hypocrites that buzied
their heads about pelting trifles, and would needs make meritorious deeds
of them, and in the mean while did cast men's consciences into so streyt
bonds, as was enough too choke them. But hereof enough has bin said
heretofore. Nevertheless we must call to mind how the law has bin
compared with the Gospel, because that such as will needs purchase themselves
righteousness by it, do bear themselves in hand that God is bound unto the^,
for their doing of their duty, and they think they do it thoroughly in deed.
Leuit. 18. a. 5.
When they here this promis, he that does these things shall live: by and by
they streyn themselves, and they believe that they shall bring the matter about
to perform all that ever God requires and commands. And when they have once
gotten the promis by the end, streytwayes they look for the wages too: and
they never think any more that their salvation is a free gift, but that they
have deserved and earned Gods promis, so that the eternal life is with the^
but a recompense of their deserts. Thus ye see what is meant by the Law when
S. Paul compares it with the Gospel. And as touching the Gospel he does us
to wit, that it is a doctrine whereby God shows himself to be our father, with
covenant that we should be set free from the condemnation of Satan and sin,
yea and from the curse of the law. For (as we have seen before) it is said
that all such as fulfill not the law in all points shall be accursed. Now the
case is so, that all of us are indau^gered. And by that means all the world is
swallowed up in despair, and there is no remedy, unless God draw wretched
sinners out of that condemnation, and acquit them of the sentence that was
pronounced against them. Now then we see after what manner S. Paul took the
name of the Law: namely that he meant not, that the doctrine which is contained
in Moses, does not make us rightly the children of God, or that it contains
not the promises which were for the everlasting salvation of mankind: but
only that before Jesus Christ came into the world, there was not yet any full
liberty or freedom as there is now adays, and moreover that the hipocrites
abused the law by their false interpretations. For they surmyzed that they
could make God amends, and thereby purchase favor at his hand. And therefore
S. Paul says that we shall always be in bondage till we be begotten again
by another kind of seed, that is to wit, by the Gospel. But let us mark
well these words, where it is said that Agar or Sinay represents the
Jerusalem which was at that time, that is too wit, the same City which had
erst bin Gods sanctuary, and should have bin the welspring of all heavenly
doctrine, Esai. 2. a 3.
according too Esaias and Micheas, which say, The law shall come from Sion, Mic.
4. a. 2.
and the word of God from Jerusalem. Howbeit for as much as the Jews were
corrupt, and had mingled their own inuentio^s and glozes with the pureness of
the true doctrine, yea and had forsaken Jesus Christ the fountain of life: S.
Paul says that that Jerusalem of theirs is like Agar the bondmayd, and like
the mountain Sinay which cannot engender but to condemnation: and that is a
thing well worthy to be marked: for it serves too show that God did never
so tie his grace to any one place, but that he punished the thanklesnesse of
the inhabiters, Psalm. 48. a. 3. and. 132. c. 13.
when they would not have the wit to make their benefit of the good things that
he had put into their hands. Behold, Jerusalem is called Gods holy city, his
royal palace, his house, and the plac^ of his abode: all these titles are given
it in the holy Scripture. Math. 4. a. 5. and. 27. f. 53.
And yet notwithstanding S. Paul says that she is become like Sinay a
barrein hill in a deserte and elendge place, and out of the bounds of the holy
land which God calls his resting place and the heritage of his faithful and
chozen. Seeing there was such a change in the City of Jerusalem, which had bin
chozen of God and honored with so many goodly and excellent titles: what shall
become of al such people as do now adays refuze the doctrine of the Gospel?
Although they were exalted to the like honor, yet could God well enough make
them to tumble into all reproach. We see what is said of all those Cities where
our Lord Jesus Christ had preached the Gospel: Math. 11. c. 21.
as of Capernaum and the rest. For they might have boasted of their having of
the message of salvation first before all others, and of Christ's being
conversant among them rahter than at Jerusalem. But he says, thou shall be
cast down to the bottom of hell: and that was because they were stubborn and
maliciously wilful, in disdeyning to receive the grace that was preached unto
them. Yea and we see what Jeremy says of Silo. Iere. 7. b. 12
Because the Jews boasted so much of their town of Jerusalem, under the
color of the Temple and the altar: Go your ways to Silo (says he): was not
the Ark placed there a long time? did not me^ resort thither from all coasts
to worship God? did they not offer sacrifizes there? And what see ye now? a
terrible toke^ of Gods vengeance, because they had not profited themselves by
the benefit that was offered to the^ first of all. Now therefore let us apply
this to our own instruction, that whenever God shall have bin so gracious to
us, as to make his abode among us, and as it were to plant his royal seege
with us too reign over us, we may walk in fear and warenesse, indeuering on
our side to obey him, and to shroud our selves soberly and advisedly under his
wings. For if we think to hold him bound unto us, and thervpo^ presume to be
wilful in our own co^ceyt, and vnhalow the gracious gifts which he had
dedicated to our salvation: surely such lewdness shall not abide unpunished. So
the^ we be warned by the example of Jerusalem, to yield our selves peasably to
the obeying of our God, and to suffer him to govern us, applying our selves to
him in all respects, without puffing up into vain presu^ptio^, when he shall
have bestowed any of his spiritual gifts upon us, but rather confessing that we
be so much the (...) beholde^ unto him, and thervpo^ taking occasion to humble
our selves. And here by the way we see what a fondness it is of the Papists,
too tie God unto Rome under color (as they say) that it is the Apostolic sea.
Let us put the case it were so, although we know not why, for all that they
allege of S. Peter is but tales and stark lies. It is very certain that S.
Paul was hild prisoner at Rome, and it may be gathered that he was even put
too death there. Behold, all the holiness of Rome is this, that the Gospel
was persecuted there, and that that Devilish dungeon has bin defiled with the
blood of the martirs, as it were to provoke gods wrath, and too confederate it
self too fight against the truth, and as much* as may be to abolish the name
and remembrance of our Lord Jesus Christ. Behold here all the worthiness of
Rome. But now admit that they had the records which the City of Jerusalem
had, whereof not withstanding they find not one syllable in the holy
Scripture. It is not said that God will reygne or have any dwelling in the
City of Rome, nor that it should be named the moother church, nor have any
other dignity or pre-eminence at all. In deed Saint Paul says that the
faith of the Romans, Romans 1. b. 8.
(and yet they were then but a handful of people,) was at that time known
euerywhere, even to their great renown. For ye must not think that those
which bare the swoorde there were the Christians: but they were a few folk
gatherd together in covert. Those does S. Paul praise and commend: but yet
does it not follow that the Church was over all the whole town of Rome,
notwithstanding, whatsoever it were, we see what happened too Jerusalem.
Saint Paul tells us that it differed not from Agar or Sinay, which is an
unholy and defiled place, so that the holiness thereof was utterly done away,
because it continued not in the pure doctrine of the Gospel. Therefore we may
conclude that such as have bin nearest unto God, and too whom he has
communicated himself most familiarly, shall be shaken off as strangers, if
they abide not in the pureness [of the truth] which is the inseperable band
whereby we be made one with our God. But surely we see that now adays, the
pure doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ is not only shaken off, trodden under
foot, despyzed, and skorned at Rome: but also cruelly persecuted with fire and
^^ord, and finally that there is no religion at all there. For that place is so
full of filth and lewdenesse, that if a man go thither, it is a wonder that
ever he should return with any fear of God or with any good seed in him.
We see then that it is as a dungeon of hell: and would God that they which
have bin there had rather broken their necks, than lifted up a foot to go
thither. For we see presently, that the country of France has bin infected
with all ungodliness by it, so that the most part of them are become no
better than hogs and dogs, having less religion in them than brute beasts.
But yet (as I have touched heretofore) we be warned hereby too walk in fear
and wariness, and too take good heed that we be not bereft and deprived of
the benefit which we have received, if we abuse it, least God pour out his
horrible wrath upon us, and we become as a mirror and pattern of reproach
after the manner of Jerusalem, which S. Paul does here set upon the scaffold,
not withstanding that it had bin so highly honored before. Furthermore let us
mark, that under the figure of Abraham, God does here show himself a father
too all his: and so ye see we be begotten of God, so as we have room in his
Church. But yet is it not enough for us too call upon God as our father, except
we be rightly begotten again by the incorruptible seed, which is unto us as a
pledge of everlasting life and salvation. If it be asked, how then is it
possible that we should be begotten of God, and yet notwithstanding be as it
were a bastardseede? The answer is, that we by our own vice and naughtiness
do mar Gods seed which is his word: for so is it named by S. Peter. 1.
Pet. 1. d. 23.
But it is certain that in respect that the word proceeds from God it
contains in it self nothing but all goodness. And again we see what
pureness shyneth there, how that all the treasures of Gods righteousness,
mercy and goodness are uttered there. Thus then you see what manner of thing
Gods word is, and what is the nature thereof. Nevertheless when we corrupt it
and falsify it by our own fancies, and make a minglemangle of it: we may still
be taken for Gods children, howbeit we shall be but as bastard children, as
shall be declared more at large (by Gods leave) after dinner. For then will S.
Paul declare, that although Ismaell were the eldest Son, yet was he in the
end driven out of the house wherein he had taken the chief room upon him,
howbeit that he was but a bastard, and also borne of a bondwoman. Then let us
mark that we must not only be begotten by Gods word into a pure faith, and
God by his holy spirit inlighten us that we may know his will according as he
witnesses it unto us. For if we change his word after our own fancy, and
disguyze it: truly it may be called Gods seed still, but yet is it not so in
deed, what soever we make of it, because it abides not in his own
soundness. And here ye see the cause why so many do now adays falsely name
themselves Christians: according as the Papists will well enough confess that
they believe in God, and that they be contented too hold themselves too the
holy Scripture. But yet for all that, it is apparent that they be utterly
perverted, and that as touching the Scripture, whereas they ought too receive
it with all reverence, they turn it too their own lyking, yea and make a
mockage and scoff of it, and (as I said erewhyles) they spewe out this
blasphemy against it, that it is a noze of wax, and that men may turn it
which way they list: and moreover it is apparent that they have turmoyled all
things by their own forgeries. For what else do men call Gods seruis in
popery, but the things that men have set down of their own brain. There
is no mention of ruling themselves by Gods commandment and ordinance. God
must be thrust out of his place, and men take upon them that which belongs
unto him, chalendging authority too bring folks consciences into bondage, and
to make what laws they think good. But that is to villainous and outrageous a
corruption. On the other side, whence do the Papists draw the Articles of
their faith? even out of their own decrees, for they recke not too draw any
resolution out of the holy Scripture. So then they pass not a whit what is in
the holy Scripture: but if any thing be agreed upon and received by common
opinion, that is as an Oracle from heaven with them. And we see also that when
they intend to prove any of their toys, the first reason that they make, is
that it is received, and that antiquity ought to prevail, as who would say
that there were any prescription in the matter: and thereupon they pull out
certain textes of the Scripture by the hears of the head, and these must also
help forward the matter. But [when all comes to all] it is but flat mockery,
and it is apparent that they wilfully corrupt Gods word. For there is such
gross and beastly ignorance in them, that very children might justly spitte in
their faces for it. So then the Papists are a fair looking glass too us at
this day, for the things that are contained here in S. Paul: that is to wit,
that many of them vaunt themselves to be Gods children, and householdmeynie of
his Church, and yet notwithstanding are but bastard slippes, and of a
corrupted seed, because that in stead of cleaving thoroughly to the pure
doctrine which were able too beget them again into the hope of the heavenly
life, they be so given to their own minglings, that there is not any more
soundness in them. But we need not to go any further too show that the
matter which S. Paul treats of here, is verified too much of the Popedom.
For where aboutes is our greatest strife now adays, but for freewill, for
merits, for satisfactions, and for such other things? The Papists say that we
are able by our own freewill, to purchase grace at Gods hand, not that we
need not too be aided and succored by his holy spirit, but because there is a
certain matching together (say they) between God and us, so as God works
one piece and we another. Thus do they make us Gods marrowes, and like as our
strength would be to weak if it were not succored on Gods behalf: so should
Gods grace (say they) be vnauaylable, if we made it not of force by our own
moving thereunto. And hereupon again they forge and build their merits: there
is none other talk among the^, but of purchacing the realm of paradise, by
making God beholden too them: and then step forth their merits and
satisfactions to ransom all the faults that they have committed. Thus ye see
in effect what the Papists prate and iangle. Thereupon they conclude, that it
is blasphemy too say that Gods Law is impossible, and that we be not able
too perform it: saying that there is no man but he may fully discharge
himself of it when he lists. It is an easy matter for them too prate after
that fashyon in the shadow: but they that say so, are naughty ruffians,
drunkardes, swearers, and folk given too all villainy and outrage. For men
know well enough what the holiness of the Moonkes, of the shauelings, and of
all the whole rabble of their rifraffe and Cankerwoormes is. But we on our side
say that we be b^^ne the bondslaues of sin, and are h^ld in so streyt
bands under the tyranny of Satan, that we cannot so much as think one good
thought of well doing, but go forward still unto al evil, like as if an Ass
should always bear his yoke or burden with him, and yet we sin not but
willingly: But how soever we fare, we be so saped in sin, that naturally we
cannot do any thing but offend God, and therefore that he must be feign to
enlarge us and set us at liberty by his holy spirit. Moreover we say, that
the law of God is impossible to be fulfilled, and that it shows us our duty
to the end to condemn us and to stop our mouths, and too make us come before
God as wretched offenders, too obtain grace at his hand for the sins which
we have committed, and to confound us with shame, to the end we should grant
our selves to be damned, and seek to be saved at Gods hand, through the grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ. Finally we say, that too justify our selves before
him, is a thing that passes all our ability, and that he supplieth our wants
because he sifteth us not with rigor, nor enters into account with us: and
that when we have offended him, there is none other satisfaction for it, than
the sacrifize that was offered by our Lord Jesus Christ, nor any other
clenzing, than to plundge our selves over head and ears in his blood. Thus ye
see how the doctrine which is contained in S. Paul, is to be put in practice
in respect of the disputatio^s of the Papists against us. For it is certain,
that for all their bragging and false prete^ding of the name of God, and for
all their saying that they be his children because they be begotten by the holy
scripture: they show that their mother is Agar or Sinay, and consequently that
they be bondmen borne, and do tie the rope about their own neck, because they
have no will to go unto God, too receive the freedom that he offers them,
but will rather usurp to themselves the thing that belongs to God only, and
will needs justify themselves by their own merits; and fulfill the law of
themselves. Therefore they be bondchildren, and continue slaves still, and in
the end must be driven quite out of the house. As for us, we shall see
hereafter what proof the doctrine has which we hold, and what it brings
with it: which is, that we have none other freedom than is given us by the
doctrine of the gospel, according also as our Lord Jesus Christ shows in the
viij. of S. John, that it is his pecul^^^ office to make us free, and that the
drawing of us out of damnation, is a special privilege given unto him by God
his father. Therefore when we come too our Lord Jesus Christ, and in him
seek, for all things that we want, knowing that by his means we be delivered
from the yoke of the law, which we are not able to bear, and which not only
made us too stoop, but also weyed us down to the bottom of hell: if is the
true seed that begets us again into full freedom too be Gods children,
not only to be bruted so in this world, but also to be auowed so at his
hand before his Angels, that in (...) we may come too the heritage that is
bought so dearly for us, and which we cannot attain to by our own power,
but by the means of him to whom it belongs who communicates it unto us
according as he offreth it us daily by his Gospel.

But now let us fall down before the Majesty of our good God with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us feel them better than we
have done, so as it may make us to grow and increase more and more in true
repentance, that our coming unto him may be in all lowlynesse without
hypocrisy, being ashamed of our wretchedness, and not seeking any other
remedy than in our Lord Jesus Christ: and that forasmuch as our good God
has adopted us and sealed the grace of his adoption in our hearts by his holy
spirit, we may stand steadfast in the pureness of his Gospel, without adding
any thing of our own, and without marring it by our own interpretations, and
that he so hold us in the obedience of faith by his holy spirit, that like
as he has begone too show himself bountiful toward us, so we also may go
continually forward to the said perfection; without swaruing aside at any time.
And so let us all say, Almighty God our heavenly father. etc.

The. 30. Sermon, which is the seventh upon the fourth Chapter.
26 But the Jerusalem which is from above is free, which is the mother of us
all.

27 For it is written, be glad thou barrein which bear no children, break
forth and cry thou that trauellest not: for the desolate has many mo children
than she that has a husband

28 And we my brethren, we be children of promise, after the manner of Isaac.

29 But like as then, he that was borne after the flesh persecuted him that
was borne after the spirit: even so is it now.

30 Nevertheless, what says the scripture? Cast out the bondvvoman and her
son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the
free woman.

31 So then brethren, we be not children of the bondvvoman, but of the free
woman.


WE have seen this morning that many do boast themselves to be faithful,
pretending falsely to be Gods children, and are so taken to the worldwarde, who
notwithstanding are but bastards, and God disclaymeth them, because they have
corrupted the good seed which is the pure doctrine, whereby we be begotten new
again to be made partakers of the free adoption whereto God calls us. The^ all
that we have to do, is not to be counted too be of the Church, except we be of
the pure and sound seed, that is to say, except we follow Gods word without
any corruption or mingling. And for this cause does S. Paul bring us back too
the heavenly Jerusalem, that we might know who is our mother. Truly to speak
properly, such as pervert the natural sense of the scripture are not the
children of God, and all their crying and calling upon him as their father, is
but stark lying and hypocrisy. Howbeit forasmuch as they be taken to be of
that degree: S. Paul discerns them out by their mother, too the end we might
know which are Gods true and lawful children and allowed of him. For the (...)
of the Church is oftentimes pretended at al adventure, and in these days the
Papists make a buckler of it to sheeld their errors withal. And because the
holy scripture is against them: they think it may serve them for a covert,
that they (as they wene) have the Church on their side. Yea but S. Paul
tells us that we must be wise to discern which is the true Church. For the
Jews had color enough to show that God had his abiding place in Jerusalem,
Psalm. 137 c. 14.
because he had chosen it out with assurance that he would rest there for
ever, as we have seen this morning. And yet notwithstanding the very same
Jerusalem became as a den of thieves, because our Lord Jesus Christ was
crucified there, and the Jews were for their unfaithfulness cut utterly off
from the house of God, because they had indeuered to the uttermost of their
power to abolish his truth. Though the name of Jerusalem had erst bin
honorable: yet was it then had in reproach and disdein both before the Angels
and before all the faithful. Even so at this day we ought to consider well
which is the Church, to the end that we be not children of a bastard seed,
and so God shake us off and banishe us out of his house, for prete^ding his
name so falsely through hypocrisy before men. In deed it is a very excellent
honor that God gives to his Church, in saying that she is the mother of all
the faithful, and it agrees with S. Paul's report in another place, 1. Tim.
3. d. 15.
where he says, that she is as it were the pillar that vpholdeth. Gods truth
in this world. Not that the truth has any need to be mainteyned by us, which
are inclined to all lightness and inconstancy, and which have nothing in us
by nature but untruth: for what stedinesse is there to be found in us, to say
that Gods truth should stay upon men? But because that of his infinite
goodness it is his will to have his word preached here beneath, and he has
committed the charge thereof to such as he calls thereto, Mat. 23. b. 9.
in respect where of the Church is called the mother of us all. For as our lord
Jesus Christ tells us) we have but one father, which is God, yea and he is
the father as well of our bodies as of our souls. Howbeit God is our
spiritual father without having any make, and yet notwithstanding he begets
us into the hope of eternal life, and that is by the means of his Church,
wherinto he has put the said incorruptible seed, Esaias. 59. d. 21.
according as he says by the Prophet Esaias: My word (says he) shall be in
thy mouth, and continue with thy children from time too time, and with all
those that shall come of thy race. Thus ye see how God intends to govern his
faithful ones, namely by his word, which he makes to be as a pledge and
inestimable treasure of salvation in his Church, to the end that we should be
begotten and nurrished with it. Therefore (as I have touched already) we had
need too be so much the more skilfuller in discerning the Church. For seeing
it is the mother of Gods children, the name of it ought not to be dishonored
and trampled under foot, nor yet defiled as it is seen to be nowadayes. There
is not a more common treachery, than to put forth the name of the Church to
deface and darke^ Gods truth. For whereat do the Papists ame nowadayes in
vaunting with full mouth and full throat that they be the Church, but to stop
Gods mouth, and to thrust his word under foot, that it might no more be
spoken of, and that in the mean while the things that men have forged after
their own lyking, should be received without any gainsaying, and sticked to and
obeyed? We see then that men which are but earthwormes and rottenness, are
put into the balance against God, and all under pretense of the Church. But
here Saint Paul warns us to seek the Church which has the pure doctrine
whereby we were adopted of God to be his children. Now I have told you
heretofore, that the whole matter lies in our being ingreffed into the body
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and also in our acknowledging that we be accursed
by nature, that all our works are but filthiness, that the Devil holds us
subject to his tyranny, and that there is none other help for us, but that
God should receive us to mercy and pity. Therefore let us go into Gods house
by the said gate, that is to wit, by acknowledging that there is none other
way for us to get in but by the only mere grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Thus ye see how the Church does breed us and bear us, verily even by the
foresaid incorruptible seed. Now that we may sore the better by this text,
we have two points too mark. The one is that we must not be like these
fantastical fellows, which think they may be faithful without readings or
preachings, bearing themselves in hand, that the holy Ghost ought to reveal
himself too them by dream, or I wot not ^owe else. And in good sooth they
despize all doctrine, and (to their seeming) all instruction is but as an Apcie
for young children. Let us beware that we let not our selves looce after that
fashion by the means of Satan and of his wiles. But if we covet to be counted
Gods children, and to have the true mark whereby we may be known before the
Angels: let us suffer our selves too be taught, and let us keep the order
of the Church with all reverence and lowliness. And so the greatest sort and
such as are exalted to any degree of honor, ought always to be thoroughly
persuaded in themselves, that the greatest dignity which is possible for them
to have, is to be children of the Church, yea through they were Kings and
Princes. For he that exempteth himself from that state, does utterly renounce
God, and cut himself quite off from all hope of salvation. Therefore mark it
for a special point, that so long as we be in this world, we must indeuer
too profit in Gods word, because that that is the place where all our
spiritual life lies: and that like as God has begotten us again by it, so
also we shall be fed by it too the end, as by the only food of our souls.
Then let us not be so proud and presumptuous as to despize all teaching, as
though we had no more need to be scholars. But let us from day to day receive
that which is told us, and by that means let us become true children of the
Church. Thus much for that point. The second point is that we must discern,
and not be as beasts that are driven over marises, and overthwart the wide
fields: but consider which is the Church, according as God has imprinted
certain signs of the Church, which signs will never deceive us. Therefore
when we have Gods word preached unto us purely without any mingling, so as
there is no corrupting of the Gospel, but we be led wholly unto God to seek
all our welfare in him, and keep the way which is showed unto us, which way is
our Lord Jesus Christ, so that we being rid of all pride and ouerweening,
do suffer our selves to be clad with the clothing that is offered us in our
Lord Jesus Christ, and repose al our glory there, I say when we have the
doctrine after that manner: then is it Gods house and Sanctuary, then is it the
true Church and our mother, and we may be well assured that God also auoweth
and accepts us as his children. T^ (say I) is a must sure and infallible
proof, at leastwise if we become not brute beasts wilfully, as we see many
do, who shet their eyes and stop their ears, and bear themselves in hand that
they be safe, if they can once pretend the name of the Church, to hide all
their abuses and trumperies, and the illusions of Satan with it. Wherefore let
us not be so beastly by our own wilfulness: but let us consider whither God
sends us to be truly regenerated by the seed of his word, and to be fed
with it as with our only food. And for the same cause also is this text of Esaias
aledged, God speaks not at randon to some multitude that might vaunt
themselves too be the Church, Esa. 54. a. 1.
but only to the flock that should be left, after that the Jews had bin
horribly run astray and scattered asunder, as we know to have happened unto
them. Surely at the first sight a man would have thought that God had utterly
banished and abolished his Church out of the world: and yet notwithstanding he
had gathered together a small number of them, and those are called the remnant
of the free election. For which cause the Prophet Esaias says, that such as are
redeemed and unfeignedly returned unto God, Esaias. 1. a. 9
to rule their life obediently after his word, are the children of the Church.
And here we have to note by the way, that the Church tryumpheth not in this
world, neither shines with so gay and stately pomp, that men might be
ravished at the only sight of it, so as they should submit themselves unto it:
but that it is most commonly forsaken, and as it were disfigured, and that is a
point well worthy to be marked. Mat. 10. b. 10.
For whereas the Papists brag that they have the Church on their side: how are
they able to do that? They must needs bring some evidence. But they allege
not aught save their riches, their authority, and the great pomp and bravery
that is among them: but those are not the things that God will have his Church
known by. For we know that our Lord Jesus Christ will reign here in the
thickest of his enemies, insomuch that the lesson which he taught his disciples
must always be verefied upon us, that is to wit, we shall be forsaken and
despyzed of the world, men shall bleare out their tongues at us, and we shall
be so troubled and vexed here, as we may not seek for any peace or rest
here. Now then, whenever any man talks too us of the Church, let us
bethink us well of the thing that Saint Paul tells us here. For he
likeneth the Church to a widow, which is all alone in her house and has
neither succor nor help. The world forsakes her, no man makes account of her,
she is as good as half dead and buried already. Nevertheless God says that
she shall be set aflote again, and that she shall have mo children than she
that is married and is in credit and reputation. This lesson must we (I say) put
in ure nowadayes when we see the poor Church so trodden under foot, and the
enemies thereof in such pride or rather madness, that they set up their
crests and triumph over us, as though we were no better than dust and smoke.
When we see such things, let us wayt patiently till God gather together those
whom he has chosen: and let it content us that he auoweth us for his children,
though the world disdeyn us, and shake us off after that sort. Ye see then
that we must not bring eyes full of vanity, to discern which is the Church,
as they do which will have nothing but pomp and great outward shows. But
contrariwise let us consider that god will so afflict his poor church, as
there shall not appear any beauty or shape in her too the worldwarde, but
rather utter desolation, yea (and as we commonly see) every man shall rise up
against her. But howsoever she fare, let it content us, that God gathers us
to him as his children: yea and let us mark, that when we be called by the
pure doctrine of the Gospel, we be made fellows with all the fathers whom God
chose under the Law, with all the holy Kings and Patriarchs, with all the
Prophets and Martyrs, and finally with all the faithful ones that have bin
since Abell to this day, or which shall be to the worlds end. No doubt but
the Papists will brag enough of their multitude: yea, but we see that the
Prophet laugheth all of them too scorn. And why? We must always discern
which are the [true] children. For what else we are all the Churches of the
Papists than Brothelhouses of Satan? All things are infected, nothing is there
but fylthynesse, Gods service is there utterly marred, and too be short, there
is no soundness at all in them. The Papists therefore for all that ever they
can pretend too make themselves Gods Church, are but misbegotten Bastardes,
as they that are tied too the Brotherlhouse with their mother that Sinagog of
hell.

Ye see then how the case stands and it is not I that does say it, but it is
the Prophet Esaias that speaks so, and Saint Paul who is a faithful
expounder of Gods meening, confirms the matter. Wherefore let us learn too
join with the true children of God, which have the infallible record of the
holy Ghost, and not follow the greater throng, but let all these wretches go,
which cast themselves wilfully into Satan's snares, and wander like brute
beasts without any discretion. But by the way we have to mark, that such as
are the children of the Church cease not to be our fathers, insomuch that
besides the common brotherhood that is betwixt them and us, there is this
moreover, that by their means we be begotten in the word of God, Gal. 6 d. 16
according as it is said that we be Abraham's children, and the true Israel
of God, as if we were descended of Jacobs race. Therefore we have those for
our fathers which are our brothers too: and all of us together are the children
of God and his Church. For whereas our Lord Jesus Christ is in very deed the
only son of God: he is to this end called our head, that we being knitte
together in him, and becoming members of his body, might be hilde and taken
for Gods children, becoming that thing by free adoption, which we be not by
nature. And Saint Paul tells us, that this befalls us by promise after the
example of Isaac, too express that we must not have any vain confidence in
our own deserts, or in any virtue that is in our persons, but be utterly
void of all pride, knowing that all the worthiness which we have, comes
of Gods mere grace and free gift. Thus ye see that the thing wherein we differ
from the bastard children which boast themselves falsely of Gods name, is that
whereas they be puffed up with selfelyking, and delight in their hypocrisy,
and are always prating of their free will, of their meritorious works, of
their satisfactions, and of their virtues as well cardinal as theological, as
they term them, and (to be short) have nothing in them but pride: We on our
side stick to the promise, that is to wit, that God having looked upon us
with mercy, has drawn us out of the dungeon of destruction wherein we were
and by his Gospel told us, and assured us that he will be our father, and
that an heritage taryeth for us, which is purchased for us, not by our selves,
or by any mortal creature, but by Jesus Christ, who being very God became
man, to the intent we might obtain the thing in him which is not to be found
in all the world. Ye see then in effect that the end whereunto S. Paul's
conclusion tends, is that if we mind to be well grounded in the doctrine of
the Gospel, and to be sure of a good stud and ankerholde of our salvation, we
must not intermedle any opinion of our own deseruings with it, nor surmise that
we be able to bring any thing of our selves, but simply receive that which God
offers us, and suffer Jesus Christ to be our savior wholly and not by
halues. That is the thing whereunto the word promise tends, as I have declared
more at large already. But the law had also his promises, howbeit with
condition, as I have declared. The promise that S. Paul speaks of presently,
is the thing that abolisheth all man's pride, and disgraceth the men them
selves, showing them that there is nothing in them but utter confusion, and
that all their welfare lies enclosed in our Lord Jesus Christ, so as we cannot
come by it, nor enjoy it but by means of the Gospel. Now the Gospel tells
us that we must hold all of God, and do him homage for our salvation, because
he gives it us, and it is not a wages due unto us, that he should by any
means be bound unto us. And heerevpon S. Paul says, that it is so even yet
still at this day, according as Moses declares under the figure which he did
set forth this morning. For in Abraham's house (says he) there was an elder
some called Ismaell, and he persecute ^. Isaac which was the lawful son. Now
then it behooves us to be so handled and dealt withal, that such as have nothing
but dissimulation and hypocrisy in them, which are but as bastardships, and
which are utterly corrupt and become strangers, may nevertheless crake and
boast their fill, and set up their bristles against us, as though we were
unworthy to kiss their feet. Such manner of men then must perke up in all
pride, and persecute us: but yet let us be constant says S. Paul, and let not
our faith be shaken down by such loftiness, nor by the wiles that are cast
in our way by those hypocrites and falsifiers, which have perverted Gods
doctrine: For in the end the fame will happen too them (says he) which is
reported of the house of Abraham, namely, drive out the son of the bond
woman, for he shall not be ^^ire All they then that vaunt them selves to be
faithful, and win needs be taken to be of Gods household, shall be cut off
as rotten members, and not have any part or piece of inheritance there. And it
is moreover a right excellent lesson, which conteyneth a very profitable
admonition, even to confirm the thing which I have touched already, which is,
that the pompes of this world must not bleare our eyes, to carry us away at a
gaze when we see great solemnities and gorgeous deckings. If a man should
believe no further than he sees, when the Pope were in his Pontificalibus, he
might be taken for a God, he has so many knicknacks glistering about him. And
no marvel though many be amazed at it, as though one had knocked them on the
head with a club, and become as good as brute beasts. For why? men are so
given to judge fleshly, that they be worse than little children in things that
concern Gods kingdom. But yet for all this, ^eholde, Saint Paul says, that
they which have the primacie, and are al in all, and are dreaded of every man,
and finally which bear the title of first begotten, are oftentimes but
Ismaelites, so as they be but bastards, allege they their eldership never so
much. But if S. Paul were alive at this day, that one text of his were
enough too make him too be burnte a hundred times. For let men write and
speak as much as they list, and they can not more lively decipher or bewray
that the Pope and al his clergy are a heap of Ismaelites and filthy
bastardes, which fight against God, and all his true and right begotten
children, according also as Moses has reported it. For what else allege the
Papists for them selves, save that it is not a day or twain ago, or a hundred
years ago that they have had possession: but that they have kept their
traditions and Ceremonies these eight or nine hundred years? But surely even
in this behalf also they lie, and are past shame. But put the case that the
world had not appayred these eight hundred years: yet notwithstanding, that
eldership of theirs which they allege, is not better nor of greater value than
was the eldership of Ismael. Again, unto their eldership they add also
multitude, saying, that we be but a handful of folk in comparison of them,
they have kings and Princes on their side, the whole world agrees with the^,
both great and small say as they say, and the largeness of their kingdom
stretches out far and wide throughout al Europe welneere, and into a piece of
Affrike. When they have all this for themselves, very well, it is even as the
eldership of Ismael. Nay, it were more meet for them to have begone at the
other end, that is to wit, at the holding fast of the pure doctrine of the Law
and the Gospel, without mingling any thing at all with it: for else it is a
general conclusion, that there is nothing in them but corruptnesse and
bastardie. But they will not enter into this discourse, that men might know
whither they be bacebegotten of Gods word or no: for it is seen too manifestly
already. And in good faith (as I have said already) under the name of the
Church, they have boldly taken upon them to disanull and falsify the whole
word of God. Sothe^ there is no bringing of the Papists to the true trial or
touchstone, that men might discern certainly whether they be Gods children or
no: but they stand proudly upon their eldership as Ismaell did: they allege
that they are an infinite number, and we but sprules as ye would say, and folk
despised to the worldwarde, which have neither estimation nor credit. Thus ye
see how Ismaell speaks now a days by the mouth of the Papists. Now we for
our part had need to be armed with patience: for it is a right hard
temptation, that they which are Gods deadly foes, should after a sort possess
the highest rooms in his house: and that we should be hidden under the^ like
corn under chafe upon a barn floor. This is a hard and irksome plight. And
surely we see many that give over the Gospel through infirmity. When the
poor simple souls here these so brave titles of Catholic Church, of
Apostolic sea, of Vicar of Christ, of Successor of S. Peter and S. Paul, of
Prelates, and of Bishops: I say when all this gay geere is flashte out before
the silly souls: they are amassed at it, and conclude by and by, then must we
needs stick to it. For they be ravished at the sight of these vizors that
serve to scare little children. But they that have any firmness in them, and
judge according to that which God shows them, are not at that point. And in
good sooth, when the Papists say that they be the representing Church, they say
truly: for in deed they make a godly representation [resemblaunce, or shewe]
that is too say, there is as it were a gaye gazing stock: but as the Proverb
says) all is not ^^de that glistereth. Therefore they must be searched to the
bottom, to see if there be truth in them or no. And so let us mark what is
told us here by S. Paul, that is to wit, that it was not once only that there
was an Ismaell in Gods Church to persecute Isaac: but that we see the like at
this day: and that the children of God shall be borne down and trampled
underfoot, by such as have no more but the bare title of Eldership, and under
that shadow beguyle the simple sort, cloking all their filthes and foulness
under the pretense of gay colors. But howsoever the world go, let us prepare
our selves to battle (says S. Paul) and let not our faith quayle at the sight
of the pride of the enemies of Gods truth, yea even of the household enemies
of it, which are not as Turks and heathen men, but keep a garrison in the
Church, and yet will needs be Prelates and more than great pillars of it. How
soever the world go (I say) let us not be abashed for it, since we be fenced
with the example of our father Isaac, to the intent we should hold out stoutly,
for as much as we be regenerated by the pure seed which God allows, whereby
we be made his lawful children, and heirs of his heavenly kingdom. But
here a man might think it strange that S. Paul should say that Isaac was
persecuted of his brother Ismaell. Genesis 21. a. 8
For Moses rehearses no more but that at the day when Isaac should be weaned,
and at the feast that was made at it, Ismaell laughed him to scorn. It is not
said that Ismaell laid any persecution upon Isaac, for aught that is recorded
by Moses: only it is said that he being then of some age, and thinking to have
a much higher degree tha^ Isaac, because he was already come to years of
discretion, did laugh at him, and mock him. Now if there were nothing more
tha^ simple mocking and laughter, it seems that S. Paul should not term it
persecution. We must mark that the persecutions of Gods children are not done,
only by sword, fire, racking, imprisonment, or other torments of the body: but
also in that they be wounded with the scornful reproaches which the unbelievers
and enemies of Gods truth do spue out against them. Psalm. 69. b. 10.
And if we do well practice the thing that is said in the Psalm, we shall not
think the manner of speech strange which S* Paul uses here. For where as it
is said, that the raylings which are cast forth against Gods maiest^^,
ought too rebounde back upon us: it is to show that we ought to be very
tender hearted or squeymish when we here Gods name set light, or his honor
diminished in any manner of wise. If any of us be touched in our good name or
honesty, we will be angry and make a quarrel of it: we see that for one
cross word, cholerike fellows do by and by draw their swords, and all is
under color that they must maynteyne their honor and honesty. If a man
speak evil of our Parents or kinsfolk, we will be in such heat and fumish
passions, as we can not be appeased. Then if God be misused, or his majesty
dishonored in men's mouths, aught we to suffer, and not to be moved to choler
and anger? Psalm. 69. b. 10.
Even for that cause also it is said, that the zeal of Gods house ought to
eat us up, so as we must not only be welminded and sorry for the defacing of
the majesty of our God, and for the corrupting of the doctrine of salvation,
and for the disordering of his Church: but these things must also bite us at
the heart. According hereunto it is said here that Ismaell persecuted Isaac.
If a man demand, what? had he neither torture, fire, nor sword to cut his
throat? No, none of all these: but he scoffed at the promise that had bin made
concerning Isaac. For it was said expressly, Ismaell shall live: but yet is he
not therefore heir of the promise, Isaac is he in whom they shall be blissed.
Ye see then that Jesus Christ, and consequently all hope of salvation was
closed up in the person of Isaac. Ge. 21. b. 12
When Ismaell did so disdain and scorn the souerein welfare and happiness,
that mockage of his wounded all the children of adoption, and all the
faithful, yea even with a deadly stripe. Now then we see what S. Paul
mente, and how we ought to put this doctrine in ure, which is, that we must
prepare our selves to inward battles, knowing that not only the Turks and
Paynims shall be adversaries of the Gospel, but also the hypocrites, who too
the uttermost of their power, do deface the doctrine of grace that is offered
them in our Lord Jesus Christ, to abolishe all the dignity and reverence
which we ought to give unto it in magnifying the mere bounteous goodness of
God, and in acknowledging that all our whole welfare lies there. Let us be
ready (I say) too abide such battles at the hands of our household enemies,
which boast them^^^ues too be Gods children, which are advanced even above
us, and which outface us with their eldership, as who should say, that under the
color of that, we ought too be utterly borne down and overwhelmed. But there
is yet more: that is to wit, that we must be touched too the quick, and sorry
at the heart to see Gods doctrine so corrupted. True it is that naturally we
shun the harms that come against us, as bodily persecutions and such other.
But yet for all that, we must not be so wedded to this world, as not to
prefer the heavenly heritage before all things that we esteem most worthy to
be desired. And therefore when soever Gods name is blasphemed, and when men
labor to abolishe the doctrine of life: let us in those cases set such greef
to our heart, as we can not bear with it, or at leastwise as if we were
persecuted in our bodies. For he that should cut our throat, yea and put us to
all the torments that were possible, as we see the enemies of the Gospel do,
whose rage against their poor brethren, can not now a days be stanched with
racking, burning, cutting out of their tungs, and such other like torments: all
this aught not to grieve us so much, as to see Gods name torn in pieces, and
scorned by the wicked. For the very same is such a cutting of our throtes, as
not only bereeueth us of this flightfull and transitory life, but also bears
us quite out of the kingdom of heaven. For when Gods doctrine is corrupted,
then is food turned into poison, life into death, and light into darkness. So
then let this text of S. Paul's warn and exhort us, not to be so given too
the earth and too the world, but that we may always have our minds and
understandings lifted up to the inestimable benefit that is offered us by the
Gospel, and fight more earnestly for that quarrel, than for our own life. For
truly a whole million of such lives as we have here beneath, can not be
comparable to the endless life that is promised us in our Lord Jesus Christ.
Thus ye see wherein it behooves us to exercise our selves, and we can not
exceed measure in being too angry, when we see wicked men blaspheme God after
that sort, and labor by their wiles and policies to overthrow and to
falsify the only doctrine whereby we live spiritually. Furthermore let us
mark also, how S. Paul adds in the end for a conclusion, that all they
which now a days ^ boast themselves so highly to be the Church, and specially
those that have the title of eldership, shall be driven out as bastard
children. Therefore let us not be beguyled with all the pompes that are among
those which fight against Gods pure truth, to maynteine them selves in their
tyranny by force, persecutions, braggings, and such other like things: but let
us tarry the end, which is, that they shall be cut off, for they be none
inheritors. Well may they dwell in the house, as it is said of Antichrist that
he shall sit in the Temple of God: but yet must they needs be swept out of it,
as filth and uncleanness. And although this be not so before men, but that it
is hidden from us for a time: yet let us wait till God show his truth more
full, and until our Lord Jesus Christ confound his enemies with the breath of
his mouth, and by the power of his word. Thus ye see how we ought to be
settled in invincible constancy. And although we be now despised and scorned,
yet let us not cease to hold out in the holy calling of our God, knowing that
we shall not be disappoynted, if we be grounded upon the doctrine of the
Gospel, and rest wholly thereupon till God discover the things that are now
hidden, and that we be thoroughly gathered unto him, and find that it was not
in vain that we were trained up in his pure word, giving over all the fancies
of men, and not seeking life elsewhere than in the seed whereby we were
begotten again, and in the food whereby we be sustained and nourished to
the end.

Now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God, with
acknowledgeme^t of our sins, praying him to make us feel them in such wise,
as it may lead us to true repentance, that we may mourn continually before
his majesty, and be so abashed in our selves, as yet notwithstanding we may
not doubt but that he accepts us for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and that we
shall always obtain sure forgiveness of our sins, if we seek it in true
faith without swaruing to the right hand or to the left, but only following the
path which he has showed us, as in deed we can never go amiss when we have
the day sun of righteousness shining upon us. That it may please him to
grant this grace, not only to us, but also to all people and nations of the
earth* etc.

The.xxxj. Sermon, which is the first upon the fifth Chapter.
STaude fast therefore in the liberty vvhervvith Christ has made us free, and
put not your selves again under the yoke of bondage.

2 Behold, I Paul do tell you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall
profit you nothing at all.

3 And again I protest to every man that is circumcised, that he is bound to
keep the whole law.


WE have seen heretofore, that to have a state of continuance in the Church,
we must be grounded upon our Lord Jesus Christ. For many do boast
themselves to be Gods children, who notwithstanding are not begotten of the
true seed, which makes the difference whereby God auoweth and acknowledges us
for his children. Therefore if we will be truly knit to our Lord Jesus Christ, we
must hold fast the doctrine of the Gospel, that he as our head and mediator
may join us to God his father. Therwithall I have declared that the cause why
S. Paul speaks so of bo^d and free seed, is for that they which seek their
righteousness in their own virtues, do alienate themselves from our lord
Jesus Christ, and from his grace. For by that means they bind themselves to an
impossibility, that is to say, to satisfy God in keeping his commandments.
But there is such weakness in us, as none of us is able to perform the least
point of the law: and therefore much less can we attain to the perfection that
is showed us here. And for that cause S. Paul concludes now* that we must
stand fast in the freedom which our Lord Jesus Christ has purchased for us.
It is certain that he treats here of the ceremonies of the law: but yet must
we always resort to the welhead and chief point. For if the matter concerned
no further than the keeping of a holyday, or the forbearing of some kind of
meat: it were not of so great weigh^, that such strife should be moved for
it in the Church. But Saint Paul pored not upon a matter so slight and of so
small importance. He had an eye to the doctrine: he considered that if me^
should be tide to do this thing or that thing of necessity: it were an
excluding of them from the hope of salvation. For if I must needs perform a
thing under peine of deadly sin: then if I fail, I am become a transgresser,
and there is no shift for me because God is my judge, and I must be feign to
come too account, and there is no means to redeem me. Now it is certain that
al of us are subject to the keeping of the law: but yet notwithstanding, there
is a remedy for it, which is to run unto our Lord Jesus Christ in all our
needs, who was made subject to the law to purchase us freedom, and bare our
curse to discharge us of it. Now if any necessity be laid upon us again, too
say that the doing of this or that is sin: then cannot our Lord Jesus Christ
stand us in any more stead as I said before: by reason whereof we must needs
be plunged in our own cursednesse, without any manner of relief. Therefore
it is not without cause that Saint Paul exhorts the Galathians to hold
their own, and not too suffer themselves to be brought into bondage. For by
that means he faith that they shall be bereft of inestimable benefyte, even so
far forth as they shall be fallen quite away from Gods grace or favor, and
utterly separated from our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom lies all our welfare
and happiness. Now, that we may the better conceive S. Paul's meening, and
also reap the fruit that is offered us in this text: Let us mark, that by
this word Liberty o^ freedom, it is meant that we may walk with full
confidence before God, and that he will always be favorable, so that although
we be guilty of many offenses, yet we shall be quit of them for our Lord
Jesus Christ's sake: and moreover that it is not in man's power to bridle us or
too hold us in bondage: but that it ought to suffice us to yield ourselves
obedient unto God, howbeit not after a slavish and constreyned fashion, but as
children yield themselves subject too their father, knowing well that their
father will not handle them roughly. Thus ye see what is meant by the word
liberty or freedom which S. Paul uses. Nevertheless to the end that this
shortness be not darksome: I will declare it more a^^^ge. So long as we be in
doubt whither God do love us or hate us, there will always be trouble and
unquietness in our consciences, and we shall be as it were locked up in
prison. So then there will be no freedom in our minds, till we know and be
thoroughly persuaded that God is at one with us, and that he receives us into
his favor and grace, though we be not worthy of it. But it is impossible for
us to have any certeintie of it, except we have our quittance always before
our eyes, which was made us in the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Why so? For as I said before, we be indetted unto God many wais, yea infinite
ways. For we be bound to keep the law, and we break it a hundred times a
day, yea even or ever we think of it. Again we offend even in gross faults.
But howsoever we deal, we cannot assure ourselves of Gods love, unless we
be discharged against him of the obligation of everlasting death wherein we
stand bound. Now we atteine that benefyte when we be persuaded by the Gospel,
that the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ was shed to wash away al our spots,
and that his death is a sufficient sacrifise too appease Gods wrath, and to
wipe out the remembrance of al our offenses and iniquities. Ye see then that
the way to set us free, is to know that God receives us to mercy for our Lord
Jesus Christ's sake, and that our faults and sins shall not hinder us to find
favor alwais in his sight, or to have familiar access unto him, as children
have unto their fathers. Secondly we must not be wavering too and fro, to make
conscience of every thing that me^ devise of their own heads: but walk
steadfastly according to gods word, knowing moreover that our co^scie^ces are
free, and that whither men command or forbid any thing, it is nothing to us, I
meene as in respect of the spiritual regiment of our souls: For we talk not
here of civil policy nor of the common life of men, but of our salvation. So
then, all things ought too be free unto us when they be not forbidden us by
Gods own mouth. Yet is it not enough that we have Gods word for our guide
without mingling any thing at all with it: but (as I have touched already) we
must therewithal know, that God accepts our affection when he sees us
willing to obey him, and that although there be much faultiness, and over many
infirmities in us, and that we come halting unto him, and (...) that all that
ever we do were trifling toys if he listed to examine them with rigor^: yet
nevertheless, he takes al in good worth. And why? For he bears with us as
a father with his children. That therefore is the freedom wherein we must stand,
except we will be separated from our lord Jesus Christ For (as I have said
already) if we believe not assuredly that God loves us, though we be
unworthy of it, and that his loving of us is because our sins are buried by
the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ: what will become of us? what
shall Jesus Christ boot us? Ageyn if we be in doubt and unquietness, not
knowing whether God accept our service or no, and therwithall be bound to the
keeping of this or that at men's appointment, the intangling of our selves in
so many debatyngs will never suffer us too have any rest. Neither is it without
cause that Saint Paul having exhorted the faithful to continue in the
freedom that was purchased them so dearly, adds, that Jesus Christ shall
not profit them at all, unless they know the thing that he has purchased for
them, and suffer not themselves to be in any wise bereft of it by men. Now we
see here, that the freedom which Saint Paul speaks of, is not to give us
leave to do what we our selves think good, as though he laid the reins of
the bridle upon our neck: and that will he also protest in place convenient.
Then intends he none other thing, than that we might serve God quietly
without greef of mind without constreint, and without any continual tormenting
of our selves with diversity of debatings and doubtful scruples as we see
the unbelievers do, namely such as have not their trust wholly settled upon our
Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore besides that which has bin said alredie, we have
to mark further, that the end of that freedom is, too be able too carry a
cheerful and quiet mind before God. For without that, we shall never have
the heart to obey him, but we shall always be in trouble, and not be able
too call upon him, which is the chief service that he demands and allows
of. We see the^ that this matter concerns the cheef point of our welfare,
if it be well understood. When we speak now a days of Christen liberty:
the Papists say we go about too abolishe all the ordinances and traditions
of the Church, and that we pass not what comes (...), so every man may live
as he lists, to eat flesh on all days alike without let, and to despise all
other such ordinances. But their saying so, is because they never knew, that it
is no obeying of God, unless it be done with an vnconstreyned will. For let
the Papists be thoroughly sifted all the pack of them, yea even the deuoutest
of them: and it is certain that they chafe upon the bitte, when they tire and
ouerlabour themselves most to serve God. For all that ever they do is but
unwillingly: and if they could pluck their heads out of the collar, they would
full feign do it. Furthermore when they have toyled after that fashion in their
fond devotions, they bear themselves in hand that God ought to like well of
it. And if a man tell them that they cannot do any thing that God should
accept, and furthermore that although their works were good, yet they deserve
not aught before him: ye shall see them spew out their poison (as they do) and
fall to blaspheming of God unless ye believe them that they be able to work
wonders by their own merits. Howsoever the case stand, they are never able to
know and to taste what it is to obey God. For why? they understand not what it
is too be quiet: namely that it is an vnconstreyned offering of their doings
unto God with a free heart, and an assuring of themselves that he accepts the
same, even because he handles them gently, and bears with them as with his
children. The Papists know not this, and therefore it is not too be wondered
at, though they think it strange that we should strive for that freedom, for
they wot not what it meeneth. But yet does not Saint Paul speak it without
cause: and by those words we see how precious that liberty is, and that it is
not a thing to be despised. For Jesus Christ did not jest in his death and
passion when he offered up himself unto God his father: but wrought a work
that in excellency and worthiness passes the creation of heaven and earth.
Now if Saint Paul bring in this liberty for an excellent fruit purchaced to
us by the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ: it must needs follow
that it is a high and precious thing. And to the intent we may conceive what
the nature and power of it is: we must learn too gather in ourselves unto God
when we be spoken to of it. As for example: if we be commanded or enjoined of
necessity too do such a thing or such a thing: very well, the doing thereof
too the worldward hinders not our freedom before God: for the things that
concern common policy may be bidden or forbidden, because that otherwise
they might turn too the hurt of the common weal, or else such things may be
expedient, and the^ must one of us serve another turn in common. Therefore
let us have a regard of the things that concern the policy, because it
behooves us to be knit and united together, and to have such an onement among
us, that every of us serve his neighbors turn, and none of us be addicted to
himself. But when the case concerns the spiritual liberty: then must every
of us draw home into himself, too consider the nature and property thereof.
Every of us (say I) must draw home himself as it were before God. For our
account is too be made to the heavenly judge, and therefore it behooves us too
enter into ourselves, to say thus: How may I present my self before Gods
judgment seat? If my life come to be tried by the law: woe worth me. For I am
guilty after so many sorts, yea even without number, that if I should suffer a
Million of deaths, it were too little for the offenses that I have committed.
Nevertheless God will be favorable to me, and take me to mercy for our Lord
Jesus Christ's sake, and when I resort to him, I may come with my head bolt
upright, as having my quits est and clear discharge, which was given me in the
sacrifise that he offered up for us, because that therein he has made full
satisfaction for me, and set me at full liberty. Mark this for one point,
that I must serve God, and it is good reason that I should dedicate my life
unto him. But at which end shall I begin? I cannot bring such perfection as is
requisite, no nor the hundredth part of it. Yet for all that, God bears with
me, and ceasseth not to take the things in good worth which are imperfect and
weak, yea and sinful too. And why does he so? Because he admits me as one
of his children for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake. After this manner (say I) must
we come before God, if we will conceive and understand the fruit of this
liberty or freedom that Saint Paul treats of. Now whereas he adds, that
we should not wrappe ourselves again in the yoke of bondage: thereby he
shows, that before we be come to the faith of the Gospel, and do know what
benefyte is brought us by the death and passion of the son of God, we be
all hild in streyt bonds like prisoners, and have not any freedom or liberty
at all. And in very deed, were it not that Jesus Christ makes intercession,
and is a mean between God his father and us: it is certain that our minds
should be in continual torment and unquietness. For there is none of us all
but he is convicted to be more than guilty, and therefore we should needs stand
at a stay as drowned in despair, till we were succored by our Lord Jesus
Christ and knew that God will be favorable to us, and thervpo^ could find peace
and assurance to call upon him, as knowing that Jesus Christ will be there
aforehand. On the otherside, if we know not that God has so received us into
his favor, as he is contented with our willingness to obey him, and with our
coming toward him, though it be with infirmity: we see yet another halter
that serves to hang us withal. But yet so is it with all unbelievers S. Paul
therefore does purposely warn us, that until such time as the Gospel have
taught us that God loves us, and of his own free goodness takes us as his
children, and moreover will not have us to be ouertroden by men's tyranny, and
specially that he delivers us from the bond and rigor of the Law: we are all
of us drowned in bondage, and that when Jesus Christ has once set us free, it
behooves us to maynteine well such a benefit. Now let us come to the reason
that he adds, Verily (says he) I Paul, yea even I do tell you, if you be
circumcised, Jesus Christ shall profit you nothing at all* It is a very sore
saying that circumcision should cut men off in such wise, as they should have
no part in the salvation that is purchaced for us by our Lord Jesus Christ. But
first of all we must mark, that when as S. Paul speaks here of
Circumcision, he looks not at the thing in it self, but unto the end of
it, because the deceyuers that had perverted the pureness of the Gospel among
the Galathians, made them believe that they ought too be circumcised, too the
end too keep the Law. Saint Paul stands upon that point, and says, that
if we do so constreyne and bynd our selves before God, or enter intoo such
covenant with him: Jesus Christ shall profit us nothing at all. And this is
well worth the noting. For when as we nowadayes do say, that is a hellishe
Tyranny for men to command the keeping of a thing under pein of deadly sin,
or to forbid a thing because them selves like not of it: (as the commandment
of keeping the Lent, or the shiruing of men's sins once a year:) if we strive
against such things, the Papists (as I said) cast forth their desperate
rage, without considering of the cause that moves and constreineth us to stand
upon that point and ground. For why? they look no further than to the outward
thing. But it behooves us to go further. For when the Papists command a thing
under pain of deadly sin: it is a bynding of us in such wise as we may not
have Gods favor but upon condition of doing our duty in that point. And he
that shall have so done his duty, he I say shall have as it were bound God
unto him, yea truly after the devilish opinion that reigns in popery, which
is that we must earne grace by our own deserts, and also that we must pacify
Gods wrath and wype out the rememberance of our sins and offenses by making
amends. VVherby it appears well, that if we can so discharge our selves,
then is Jesus Christ made vnauailable too us, and he shall profit us nothing at
all. For why? Jesus Christ cannot be our righteousness, except we seek the
forgiveness of our sins in the sacrifize of his death, and therwithal be well
assured that God is our father, to the end we may call upon him with quiet
consciences, because he has adopted us in our Lord Jesus Christ. It is true
that the deceyuers which had beguyled the Galathians, could well have found in
their heart that Jesus Christ should have bin acknowledged and called the
Savior of the world. And they did so mingle the law with the Gospel, as yet
notwithstanding Jesus Christ should have had his titles still. But they made a
coparcinerie, that me^ on their side should deserve, and that by that means
God should be appeased. As if they had said, that Jesus Christ supplied men's
wants: howbeit after such a sort, as the wretched consciences were always out
of quiet. The like dealing is at this day in the Papacy. And the Pope with all
the rabble of his Clergy, differ nothing at all from the cousiners ageynste
whom Saint Paul incountereth here, saving that those cousiners did put
forth their own inventions and would have had them too prevail under the
shadow and authority of Moses Law. They then ageinste whom Saint Paul
disputes, said, we must keep still Circumcision, we must needs be
circumcised still. And to what purpose? to the end we may discharge ourselves
toward God, and be accepted at his hand for doing of our duty. VVhereto
then shall Jesus Christ serve? He shall serve for to fill up a void room:
for he is not utterly unprofitable: but when men have so discharged and
cleared themselves, then if there be any want, Jesus Christ shall supply
that. After that manner did those Cousiners speak, which were Saint Paul's
adversary party. And what says the Pope? He says that in sted of the
Ceremonial law of Moses, we must keep his ordinances, and the things that
are decreed by Councelles, or by this man or that man: and that the same
byndeth us upon pain of deadly sin, so that if we offend God, we must
make him amends for it by our own satisfactions, and not by the things that
God has commanded. For the amends that we must make is not any of the
things appointed by Gods law: but an addition of an overplus of our own
device besides, and so are we discharged to Godwarde, and God must needs take
it a worth. We see then that the Pope holds the same devilish foundation
which those Cousiners labored too bring in. Howbeit that this is yet worse,
that whereas they enforced the law of Moses which ought too bear some sway:
the Pope brings in his own inventions, and the forgeries of his own brain.
But contrariwise Saint Paul says that Jesus Christ shall profit us nothing
at all: when we will needs indent with God after that fashion. And why? For it
is all one to pull Christ in pieces, and too give him but the one half of that
which belongs fully and wholly unto him alone. 1. Cor. 1 d. 30.
He is given us to be our righteousness, and he is called our peace, and what
betokens the word Righteousness? Ephesians. 2. c. 14
That God accepts us freely for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake. Now the^ if we
say that we win Gods favor by our own deserts, and that Jesus Christ is but a
supplyer of wa^ts: is it not a rending of him in pieces, and a dismembering of
him as much as in us lies? But that cannot be done nor suffered. Moreover, our
Lord Jesus Christ is given for our satisfaction or amendsmaking: for there is
none other means to set God and us at one, but by knowing that we be quite
and clean discharged, and freely quit of the bond of endless death. For if
we think to ransom our selves by our own deserts, and say that if there be
any want in us, Christ shall make it good as a small matter: it is a flat
mockery, and that is in no wise to be borne with. We see then that the cause
why S. Paul tells us that Jesus Christ shall profit us nothing, is that me^
should not beguile themselves in devising a new Jesus Christ, that should do
but half his duty: for we must receive him in such wise, as he is given us of
God his father. Now he is given us with condition that we should rid our selves
of all selftrust, and resort wholly unto him, and furthermore that it should
suffice us to have him too be our head, and thereupon serve God his father,
offering him all that we have, and assuring our selves that although the same
all be nothing, yet notwithstanding howsoever we fare, it fails not to be
taken in good part, because the adoption that is gone before, and grounded in
our Lord Jesus Christ, makes us and our works to be always accepted of God,
us (I say) that are nothing worth, and our works that are but pelting trash,
and yet notwithstanding God takes them in good worth, because he looks not
what we be, or what we do, nor upon the quality or quantity of our works:
but only looks at this, that we come unto him as members of his only son,
resting wholly upon the sacrifice whereby he has redeemed us. And therefore S.
Paul for a larger confirmation adds, that he protests and witnesses, that
he which is circumcised is a detter of the performance of the whole law. For
(says he) Jesus Christ is vnauailable, when folk will needs justify
themselves by that mean. We have a declaration clear and easy enough of
the things that Paul has said: and we must mark it well, because it is
hard too persuade me^ that Jesus Christ is utterly vnauaylable, when they go
about to make him vnauylable in any part. For although the Turks and other
Heathen folk never knew what Jesus Christ is: yet have they had an opinion
fully like the Papists, and a man shall find them to be both of one stamp.
For there were never yet any heathenme^ in the world, which have not bin of
opinion that they could not satisfy God: and yet they have gloried in their
own works, believing that their salvation or welfare proceeded of them.

The Heathen men then did always bear themselves in hand, that they were
able to purchase grace, and too deserve somewhat at Gods hand. And therevppon
they offered Sacryfices, knowing not that the same were a figure of Jesus
Christ, but yet howsoever the world went, they thought too make some
satisfaction or amends. Even so also did the Jews, when they had once marred
and corrupted the true meening of the Law. As much also do the Papists at
this day, fully resolving that God accepts their doings, and that he is in
a manner bound too them so too do. Let them then bargain with him too allow
of their doings, though they do amysse. For they be sure enough that they
can not make satisfaction too the full, nor in all points: but yet on the other
side they say, that they can do more than God has commanded and that that
shall serve for recompense and payment. Now forasmuch as it is so hard a
matter too persuade men, that Jesus Christ will not serve their turn by
halues: it stands us on hand to mark this Text so much the better, where
Saint Paul says, that whosoever is circumcysed is a detter of the performance
of the whole Law. When Saint Paul speaks after that sort of Circumcision,
we must mark that he talks not according to Gods first instituting of it:
for too what purpose did God give it unto Abraham? He gave it him as a seal
of the righteousness of faith, To. 4. b. 11.
and so does he himself say in the fourth too the Romans. Therefore the
Circumcising of Abraham, was not too make him a detter of the performance of
the whole Law: but contrariwise, too assure him of the forgiveness of his
sins, and that God accepted him for one of his children, for our Lord Jesus
Christ's sake. Ye see then that Circumcision did set our father Abraham at
full liberty. Why then did he take it? Because God gave it him as a record
and Sacrament of his free goodness. But contrariwise, those against whom
Saint Paul reasons, took Circumcision as a meritorious work, and thought
thereby to deserve at Gods hand: they entered intoo a kind of bargayning with
him, as if they should say, very well, I am beholding to you for such a
thing, and I have done this or that in recompense of it. Therefore whenever we
fall to indenting after that sort with God: we become detters of the
performance of the whole Law. As if he should say, ye must not bargain in
this case: men must not bear themselves in hand that they can partly bind
God, so as he should of right be in their debt, and bound of necessity to
take them into his Paradise for doing this or that for him. No no (says Saint
Paul) we must go more substancially too work, we must not fall to
bargayning with God, to say that he binds us to perform the whole Law, and
that we bind him to give us everlasting life. If we come to that point, we
be detters of the whole Law. To be short, Saint Paul stryueth here against
the diuelishe error that reigns in the Popedom. They term it a parting
righteousness, that is too say, a righteousness that comes partly of gods
grace, and partly of meritorious works. And why so? For it is well known that
there was never yet man in this world, that performed Gods Law, and that does
experience show too much. Forasmuch then as the Papists (as shameless as
they be) do know well enough (as I said) that it is too manifest a thing,
that men are not able to keep all the Law: they say, we mainteyne not that we
be fully rightuous in all points, but we say that Jesus Christ is partly our
righteousness and redemer, and we our selves do partly deserve well by our
own works. Fie, fie, says Saint Paul, whosoever falls too indenting
after that fashion, too say that he will earne aught at Gods hand, or make
him any recompense, so as he will play the hyreling with him, and make him as
it were his detter, as if he would say, I have done this, and therefore thou
shall pay me that: he makes himself a detter of the whole, and they be but
fond imaginations wherewith men deceive themselves, thinking that God must be
feign to take what they will give him, and to release them all the rest. As for
example, if a man be bound too pay a hundredth Crowns, and must needs pay
and deliver them, and yet notwithstanding imagines that his creditor ought to
content himself if he bring him but four florens, and say unto him here
sir, take this upon further reckening, and afterward bring him half a dozen
or half a score mo, and (to be short) do with much ado make up the third or
fourth part of the principal, and believes (...) he is by that means quite
and clean discharged: is it not (think you) to lewd an unthankfulness? For
behold, his friend opened his purse to help him in his need, and spared not
himself to succor him: and yet for all that he will be discharged for
bringing I wot not what, and for saying, here sir, take this in full payment,
whereas all that he brings is not a quarter of the whole sum. Men see well
that this were but a mockery: what then shall become of such as will needs
enter into account with God to deserve at his hand? For God auoweth that
whosoever performs not all the things that are contained in the law, shall be
cursed, and S. Paul has alleged the same text. Whereto the^ does god bind us
in his law? To perform it to the full. And who is able to do that? There is no
man that is able to fulfill any one point of it with such perfection, but that
there shall always be somewhat amiss. And now what do these hypocrites which
think themselves to have some worthiness in their own works? They bring this
and that, and will needs be rightuous in part. But God accepts no such
dealing, for he will not unsay this diffinitiue sentence which he has uttered
with his own mouth, Deu. 27. d. 26.
Cursed be he that fulfilleth not all. Thus ye see whereupon S. Paul stands
here, when he says that whosoever is circumcized, is a detter of the whole
law. As if he had said, Let not men beguile themselves any more, for God
walks not two ways at once, he has told us in his Law, that if we
discharge not our selves fully toward him, we shall be cursed. But there is
not any man that discharges himself, therefore ye see we be all accursed.
Wherefore there is none other remedy but to resort [wholly] to our Lord
Jesus Christ. For if we think too make Jesus Christ avaylable in part, and
therewithal too hold still somewhat of our own doing: it is a deceyte: for
we must needs confess that there is nothing but cursednesse in us, till our
Lord Jesus Christ have released us, and that we had need too seek our
wantes in him, in such wise, as we may acknowledge all our own works to be
nothing worth, no nor any better than filth before God, till he receive us
for his children, that we may walk in freedom of conscience, knowing that
our sins are forgiven us by virtue of the satisfaction that is purchased for
us, so as God imputes not our sins and misdoings (...) to us, because he
looks upon us in the person of his only son. Thus ye see how Saint
Paul proves that which he had said before: that is too wit, that Jesus
Christ shall not profit any of all those which are circumcyzed. For why? If
they seek the hope of their salvation in their own works, they must
discharge themselves thoroughly and wholly toward God, and not pelt him out
with gobbets and morsels as they say, but fulfill the whole Law without
myssing any one jot of it. And who is able to bring that to pass? For take me
the holiest and perfectest man that ever could be found, and he cannot do
the hundredth part of that which is commanded him. Ye see then that men are
disappoynted of the hope of salvation, if they come not void and altogyther
emptye of all their own merits, and give themselves in such wise too our
Lord Jesus Christ: as they acknowledge that they cannot be justified by him
and by his grace, except they have first renounced all that ever may hold them
back in the trust of any other thing. And furthermore, whereas Saint Paul
speaks here of being circumcyzed: he meeneth the error which the
deceyuers did set forth, in thinking to bind God to them, and to fulfill the
whole Law. As if it should be said nowadayes, that all such as keep the
Popes ordinances, do overthrow the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ. Not
that a man is damned for not eating of flesh upon Frydayes, or in Lent time:
but if he forbear the eating of flesh for superstitions sake, and think to
merit by so doing: it is certain that he renounceth our Lord Jesus Christ.
For Christ is given us to be our Advocate, so as we be reconcyled too God his
father by his means, and he has so set us free, as he will not have us too
be oppressed any more with the traditions of men. But they which keep the
Popes traditions, bearing themselves in hand that it is deadly sin too taste
flesh upon any such day, and that in forbearing it they deserve too well at
Gods hand, and that they be good satisfactions, yea and that Jesus Christ is
well honored by doing of this or that: I say if they acknowledge that, they
do also believe that the gate of Paradise should be shet against them if it
were not opened them by that confession, and they think it to be the mean to
make their atonement with God.

Now in making themselves too believe that, it is certain that they make
themselves detters as I said before, and forsake the grace that was purchased by
our Lord Jesus Christ. Now we see how we must profit our selves by this
doctrine: namely first of all we must understand that God has told us by his
Gospel, that [wee shall be welcome] as often as we come too him, conditionally
notwythstanding that we be not ouercombred by wavering too and fro like
windeshaken Reeds, but be able too call upon him freely, and with open
mouth, as upon our father which has adopted us to be his children. Secondly
we must understand that the mean too be in his favor, is too have him too
forgive us our sins. And why? Because Jesus Christ has made satisfaction for
them, and utterly discharged us of them. Thirdely, we must understand that
this is not done to the intent too lay the bridle looce in our neck, that we
might fall a scoterloping, and play the wild beasts, so as God should not
tame us: but rather too the intent we should repair unto him with a good
courage, to obey him freely. For if we were not sure that he takes us for his
children, and bears with us so gently, that the things which are nothing
worth are taken in good worth at his hand, for the fatherly love which he
bears us: surely we shall do nothing but gnashe our teeth when we intend
too serve God. But if we be persuaded that God casts such a favor toward
us, that although we be full of infirmities, and cannot do any thing that may
deserve too be well lyked at his hand, yet he accepts us for our Lord
Jesus Christ's sake: must it not needs give us courage as though our sail
were set up, and we had the wind on our stern. Therefore it is certain that
our hearts must needs run swiftly as a ship that has the full wind
upon her sails, when we know that we are in Gods favor, and that he
accepts our works, and intends not too bind us too any bondage, but is
contented too take us for his children, and accepts our willingness too
obey his. Now then, when we be once sure of that: we may serve our God with the
better courage, and because we be grounded upon his grace, it will cheer us
in such wise, as we shall offer him the sacrifice of praise and ^^rayer,
assuring our selves that he will here us, and therevppon yield him thanks
for that so great and inestimable benefyte, which he communicates unto us
every day.

Now let us fall down before the Majesty of our good God, with
acknowlegement of our faults, praying him to vouchsafe to make us so to feel
them, as it may humble us truly, and make us yield our selves wholly to our
Lord Jesus Christ, and that when we be once come unto him, we may persist in
the faith of his Gospel, without swaruing aside in any wise, and that he may
so sustein us in our infirmities, as we notwithstanding may be touched with
true repentance, too sigh and groan before him, till he have taken us out of
this mortal body, wherein we be hilde in prison under the bondage of sin.
And so let us all say, Almighty God our heavenly father. etc.

The. 32. Sermon, which is the second upon the fifth Chapter.
4 Christ is become unprofitable to you, to all of you that are justified by
the Law, and you be fallen from grace.

5 For we in spirit do wait by faith for the hope of Righteousness.

6 For neither Circumcision nor uncircumcision is any thing worth in Jesus
Christ, but faith that works by love.


WE have seen heretofore, that such as will make a partnership between their
own works and Gods grace, do foully ouershoot themselves: for as soon as we
come to reckening, God must needs judge us with rygour. Then if we go about
too get his favor, and to purchase our salvation by our own works: we must
perform Law to the vttermoste without any missing. But now let us see if
ever man discharged him (...) so perfectly. Surely we come very far short of
it. Therefore we must come empty unto God, that he may receive us too mercy,
and impute unto us the obedience of our Lord Jesus Christ, auowing it in
such wise as we lay aside all our own deseruings, and bring not any thing of
the Law with us, save only a single and pure confession, that we be damned
and forlorn till God pity us, and burying all our faults and transgressions
do cloth and apparel us again with the righteousness of our Lord Jesus
Christ his son. And for that cause does Saint Paul conclude here, that such
as will justify themselves by the law, are fallen from grace, and Jesus Christ
shall profit them not thing at all. If is not for naught that he speaks
after that manner. For the false packers that had partly corrupted the doctrine
of the Gospel in the Church of the Galathians, meant too mingle the one with
the other: that is to wit, that Jesus Christ is given us to supply our wantes,
and yet notwithstanding that we cease not to be rightuous in part, by
indeuering to do well. For they did not utterly renounce our Lord Jesus Christ,
neither said they that all the promises wherein God tells us that he will of
his goodness forgive the faithful their sins, are deceyt and mockery: but
their intent was that men should labor to justify themselves, that is to say,
to purchase favor at Gods hand by their own works. And forasmuch as we be
far from perfection: they meant that Jesus Christ should supply it as a second
remedy: that was their surmize. Likewise nowadayes in Popery, they will not
with open mouth utter this blasphemy that Jesus Christ serves us to none
other purpose, but too teach us the will of God his father: they will afoorde
to say that he has redeemed us and purchased the ground of deserving for us,
for he has opened us the gate of Paradise too enter in at, and also that his
death and passion do daily profit us, too reconcile us unto God daily when
we have offended him. But howsoever the world go, they will have us too
deserve or earne the kingdom of heaven in parts, and to redeem our sins by
diverse means, and thereof sprang all their satisfactions, and finally that if
a man cannot perform all during his life, the rest shall be fulfilled in
Purgatory. Thus ye see how Jesus Christ has but half a place with them in
receiving us unto God, and (...) in the mean while they shoulder him in such
wise, that freewill, merits, works of supererogation or overplus as they
term them, and such like things run away at leastwise with the one half of
our salvation. But S. Paul tells us that God likes no such partnership.
For either we must bring such a full performance of the Law as God may be
contented with: or else yield our selves guilty. If there be never so little a
fault, all the residue deserves nothing at all. For (as I have declared) God
promises not salvation too such as do him half seruis, or too such as serve
him after a sort: but to such as keep his Law throughout. He that does all
the things shall live: Leuit. 18. a. 5. and. Deuteronomy. 27. d. 26.
and contrariwise he that performs not all shall be cursed. But it is so
that no man does the things that are required and commanded in the Law. For
what good zele or will soever we have too serve God, there is always much
feebleness in us, and we go too him halting and make many false steps, yea
and oftentimes we happen to step aside and too go astray: and so are we all
shet out from the promis of salvation as in respect of our own works, and the
curse wayteth for us, which we cannot escape. For who is so far ouerseene, as
to take upon him that he has performed the whole Law? Then if all of us be
found guilty of offense against God: we be as good as utterly undone, till our
Lord Jesus Christ reach us his hand. Therefore it follows that we must
forget the righteousness of the law, and lay it under foot, so as it may be
utterly abolished, and thereupon that we go naked too our Lord Jesus Christ
for remedy, confessing our own poverty, and not being ashamed too be
defaced with all reproach before God, that we may be clothed again with his
glory. Thus ye see in effect what we have too gather upon this text, where S.
Paul says that Jesus Christ is made unprofitable, if men hope to justify
themselves by the Law. For it has bin too common an error in all ages, that
at the first setting forth and first brunt, men will needs pay God all that is
due too him, and in the end seek startingholes when they see no power nor
ability in them too do it. Well say they, though we cannot do all, yet
will we do somewhat. But in this case it is not for us to follow our own
imaginacions: for God will judge us according too his own word. Therefore
let us not reckon without our host, as the Proverb says, by making our selves
believe that God will accept what we think good: but let us understand that
Jesus Christ cannot boot us at all, except we seek the fullness of our
salvation in him. For it is not said in the Scripture, that the father has
given us him as a help to obtain our salvation: but that he is given us to be
our righteousness and life. It follows then that in our own selves there is
nothing but wickedness and endless death, til we have recovered the thing in
Jesus Christ, which we lost and were utterly bereft of in Adam. And these two
things are joined here together: namely that Jesus Christ profits us not at
all, and that we be fallen from grace, according as in very truth, all the
grace or favor that we must find at Gods hand, is communicated to us by the
means of our Lord Jesus Christ. And it is a very notable point. For every man
will well enough grant that we must resort unto God, because he is the
welspring of all welfare. But in the mean while the most part of men wander in
their own windlasses, and in stead of coming unto God, do go from him, as it
is too be seen in the Papacy, where wretched hipocrites and the ignorant
sort say that their gadding after their Saints and puppets, and their
mar^yring of themselves in their foolish devotions, is to get Gods favor. But
in the mean while Jesus Christ is let alone, and no man makes account of him,
but they rather hie the^ to some stock or stone which they call their Lady,
than to the Son of God. And whereof comes this? Even because they know not
how God has given us his grace, nor after what manner he will have us too seek
it, nor what way and order it behooves us to hold. Therefore when we be once
thoroughly resolved that God is our father, and also know perfectly that what
soever we have need of he will have us to draw it from out of our Lord Jesus
Christ, who is as a spring that was under the earth, and afterward is opened
and flows abroad, that every man may take his fill of it: then (say I) do we
know that Gods grace cannot be drayned dry, but yet does it not come at us,
but by the means of our Lord Jesus Christ. Too be short, let us mark that
all that ever belongs too our salvation is so put intoo the person of Gods
only son: that he alone must suffize us, and we go straight unto him, and
take all our contentation there. And as I said before, let us keep our selves
from this imagination of thinking to purchase any thing by our deserts, for it
separateth us utterly from our Lord Jesus Christ. Now hereupon S. Paul
adds, that we wayt for the hope of righteousness by faith in the spirit.
It serves to confirm that which he has said heretofore, concerning the
diversity that is between us and the fathers that lived under the Law. For
how was Abraham received intoo favor, but through faith? Yet notwithstanding
he differed from us in one thing. For in as much as Jesus Christ was not yet
discovered: Ceremonies were given him, and many mo were added at the publishing
of the Law, according too the need which the people had too be so led and
guyded. Too be short, the faithful of all ages have ever sought their whole
rightuousenesse in the grace of God. Nevertheless they were helped by the
Ceremonies and shadows, because the Gospel was not yet so reveled unto them
as it is unto us, another was Jesus Christ (who is the very pledge of
righteousness) made yet so manifest. But now let us come too that which
Saint Paul says. He sets here the spirit now adays among the
Christians, to exclude all figures and shadows, as if he should say that it
ought too suffize us that the Son of God is appeered too us for our
righteousness, and therefore we must let go the Ceremonies, because the
shadow were needelesse now adays. And not in this Text alone does Saint
Paul match the word spirit against the shadows of the Law. Truly when God
in old time did ordeyne Circumcision, Sacrifices, and such other things, it
was not too set folk at a gaze here bylowe: for all things that are contained
in the Law are in very deed spiritual. There was a pattern of them showed
too Moses on the Mountain. Exodus 25. d. 40.


So then it is certain that the fathers had a spiritual belief as well as
we, so as they knew they were not washed and made clean by three or four
drops of water: nor reconcyled too God by the sacrifizing of a Calfe or of
some other brute beast: but that our Lord Jesus Christ was their only
washyng and clenzing, and that he by the Sacrifyze of his death had
discharged them quyte, or at leastwyse should, because the thing was not yet
done, but the Fathers looked aloof at the thing which was not yet disclozed.
And moreover it is (...) without cause, that the said word [Spirit] is set
down here, to show that the fathers could not embrace the grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ, but by the means which our Lord had ordained for the time.
Therefore when any man had done amiss, he came with a sacrifice, to
acknowledge himself worthy of death before God: not too seek his atonement
in a Calfe, or in a Sheep, or in any such other thing: for that was too be
had in Jesus Christ: but yet was it of necessity that the figure of him
should go before. As much is to be said of the washings and of the residue of
those things. Col. 2. c. 17.
In these days we have the body (says S. Paul) and therefore the shadows
are not requisite any more. If a man were present before mine eyes: would I
seek too know him by his shadow? That were to darksome a dealing: and if I
might behold him in the face, what a doltishnesse were it for me too turn
away from him, and to go seek some tracinges too know him by? Even so is it
now adays with such as turn back again to the old figures. They turn their
backs upon Jesus Christ, knowing not that the rending asunder of the veyle of
the Temple at his death, betokened that all the ancient figures were
abolished, and that we at this day may enter intoo the heavenly Sanctuary,
from the which we were as good as strangers before. To be short, S. Paul
meant here too declare, that his condemning of the Ceremonies of the Law, is
not to condemn the fathers that used them, nor God that was the author of
them, but to show that we in these days have the truth and substance of
them: and consequently that the things which were shadowed heretofore, are no
more so, and therefore that we must content our selves with Jesus Christ, who
has brought all perfection with him. Thus much concerning the Ceremonies of
the Law. Now whereas S. Paul says that we wait for the hope of
righteousness in spirit: he uses a kind of speech that may seem strange:
for what is meant by waiting for the hope of righteousness? Let us mark, that
here S. Paul intended to draw us away from all things that are to be seen
in this world. For because we be too much inclyned and subject too sticking
fast here by low, when we have any thing for our senses too rest upon, so
as we cannot lift up our minds aloft, and because that men are too fleshly:
they ever covet too have al^ ^^ings open before their eyes. But God purposes to
try our obedience, by referring us too his pure and single word. And we do
then honor him aright, when we shet our eyes at all these outward things, and
hold our selves satisfied with Gods will which he has showed too us,
thinking our selves to want nothing when we have that. For this word wayt
betokens that we perceive not by eyesight the thing that we wayt for,
(according as it is said in the eight too the Romans,) and so much the more,
because the word Hope is added to it. Therefore it is as much as if S. Paul
had said: Verily my friends, if a man would go about to know the
righteousness of Christians, (that is too wit that they be Gods children, that
they be heirs of the heavenly life, and that God accepts them as if they
were Angels without spot or blemish) I say if a man would know this after a
worldly manner: he should deceive himself. For we see that the faithful are
despized folk, men vouchsafe not too look upon them but a skew, they bear a
low sail to the worldward, and (to be short) there is another pomp nor
outward show in the righteousness that we obtain by our Lord Jesus Christ.
For we seek not estimation when we say, that before God we cannot rest upon
any thing but his mere mercy, and that all our deseruings hang upon his mere
grace, and that we must go out of our selves to have Jesus Christ as the full
perfection of all goodness and welfare. When we speak after that fashion:
it is not to vaunt our selves, but too confess our selves to be full of all
reproach, so as all our worthiness is but dung and filth, and all our works
uncleanness, and that we should be lothely in Gods sight like wretched
Lazermen that are full of sores and botches, if we were not so washed and
clenzed by the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, that God did like well of us by
his means. Now then the righteousness which ought too reign among the
faithful, is not a thing full of pomp, nor a thing that is greatly gazed at
and commended [of the world]: no, but it is utter wretchedness. And therefore
S. Paul says here, that when the world laugheth at our simplicity, because
they see us hope after that fashion in our Lord Jesus Christ, and every of us
humbly abace himself even to the dungeon of hell, too the end we may be
lifted up by the grace of God too the kingdom of heau^^: although the
worldlings do mock and skorne us for it, yet must we hold on steadfastly,
assuring our selves that we shall not be disappoynted. For we know with whom
we have left our gage in keeping, namely even with him that has promised too
call us too salvation. Therefore let us walk on in the said faith, and
embrace Jesus Christ, and when we have him, let us set light by all the rest.
Let us not do him the dishonor and wrong, too shrink away from him into a
corner, and too make him serve our turn but in part: but let us acknowledge
that we be justified thoroughly and in all points by his means. Now hereupon a
man might yet make a question, and say: What I pray you, were the Ceremonies
commanded in the Law without cause why? Truly Saint Paul has answered
this matter sufficiently already. Howbeit for as much as men are slow in
resolving of matters that concern the holding fast of Gods pure truth:
therefore he shows new again, that there is difference between us and
those that lived before the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Also he had a
consideration too stop the mouths of many raylers: for if a man preach Gods
mere mercy in Jesus Christ: by and by some Mastife curres or other fall too
barking, and cast forth store of slanders, as is to be seen yet still at
this day. For if we condemn the Devilish selftrust wherewith men beguyle
themselves, in weening too obtain salvation by their own deserts: o how so
say they? that were a condemning of all good works. And after that manner do
the hypocrites now adays slander the doctrine of the Gospel which we bear
abroad, as though we meant to give leave and license too do evil, that there
might be no more difference betwixt vice and virtue. Again if we tell them
that their Ceremonies are but pelting baggage, and that the more they take
pride in them, the more abominable they be before God: o, how should that be
say they? Behold, these fellows would abolish all religion: and what a thing
were that? Shall God be no more served and honored? such is the speech and
talk that is used now adays by those curredogges, which cannot abide that our
Lord Jesus Christ should be the only foundation whereon to settle the trust of
our salvation, nor also abide that we should be governed by the pure and
alonly word of God. And for that cau^^ S. Paul says here, that in Jesus
Christ there is another Circumcizion nor vncircumcizion, but faith that works
through charity. In saying that there is another Circumcizion nor
vncircumcizio^ in Jesus Christ: he meeneth that Gods commanding of the
Ceremonies was but for a time, and that we must always have an eye wheretoo he
tended, namely that he meant to mainteyne the people in hope, because Jesus
Christ was not yet appeered too the world. For if they had not had washings,
and Sacrifizes and such other like things: they would have bin dismayed, and
the frayltie of man is such, that they would have quite quayled a hundred
thousand times. And therefore although they saw not yet fully how they should be
saved: yet notwithstanding they had therein as it were lively pictures and
lookingglasses, where they might behold the grace of god. Thus ye see how the
shadows and figures served but for a time. So then S. Paul declares, 1. Pet.
2. d. 19.
that he will not in any point diminish the authority of God who had stablished
that Law among the Jews, nor also say that all those things were frutelesse
and vnauaylable: but that we, (now after that our Lord Jesus Christ is
manifested,) are come to the fullness of time, and therefore that we must
have no more veyles to keep us from beholding him face to face, according as
he is set forth to us in the Gospel. For whenever the Gospel is preached
unto us, it is all one as if we saw Gods son crucified presently before us,
or as if we saw his blood streaming down, for so much as we be besprinkled
with it by the power of the holy Ghost, as says S. Peter in his first
Epistle. So then seeing that our lord Jesus Christ has by his death and passion
opened us the way whereby we may come to God his father: it is not for us to
buzie our selves any more about the things that were appointed for the time of
his abse^ce. It is true that he dwells not now adays in the world: but yet
have we his Gospel, which is the acco^plishme^t of al things that are needful
to our salvation: and therefore it is as good as if he were crucified among us,
Gal. 3. a. 1.
as S. Paul has said already. Now that we have the understanding of these
words in Jesus Christ, that is to wit, that the Gospel is preached: let us
come to this addition of his, that there is another circumcizion nor
vncircumcizion: that is too say, that those things must henceforth cease, and
men must rest only upon charity. And wherefore does S. Paul add the word
charity. Too show that Christenfolke will not be idle, and that they have
enough too occupy themselves about, though they keep not the figures of the
Law. For albeit that it was Gods meening to lead the people unto Jesus
Christ, in ordeyning the Sacrifizes, circumcizion, and all the residue: yet
notwithstanding men being of themselves corrupt, marred all. And truly the
Jews were of opinion, that they bound God too them in offering up sacrifize:
but it was clean contrary. For he that offered sacrifize, did there pass a
recognissance to bind himself solemnly to cursednesse, as if he should say, I
am worthy of death, in token whereof a poor beast is here killed and has
his throat cut: and is it the beast that has deserved it? no, it is I. Ye see
then that a man might there behold his own sinfulness, like as also it
behooved him to seek his salvation else where than in himself. Lo I pray you how
the figures ought to have brought folk too such a lowliness, that all men
from the greatest too the least should have condemned themselves, and thereupon
embracing the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, have rested themselves wholly
upon that. But now adays in the Popedom there is a like deceytfulnesse
vs^ed, in so much that men do falsify all that God has ordained. As how?
Look upon Baptism, look upon the Lords Supper, which were instituted to the
end that we should come and protest before God, that we hold all things of
him. What is there in Baptism? It is showed us there, that we must die in
our selves. And why so? even because there is nothing but frowardness and
cursednesse in us, so as we be the children of wrath, and utter strangers
unto God. Ye see then in Baptism a man is utterly rid of all his trust in
himself. In the Supper we come to seek our life in Jesus Christ: and so are
we stark dead both the ways. Yet for all this, the Papists ween these
things too be meritorious works. And that is the cause why they by the
Hellish abomination of their mischievous Mass, have falsified yea and utterly
defaced all things that our Lord Jesus Christ had appointed. For such a work
even as it is done by man, or the very working of the deed, that is too say,
the very doing of it as it comes and proceeds of man, must (say they) of
necessity be meritorious. But therein we see a manifest falsehood. Howbeit S.
Paul meant to go yet further, in ^^buking the hypocrisy of such as are so
much given too these outward things: the like whereof is still at this day in
the papacy. It is true that these miserable wretches take great peynes too
serve God: they trotte up and down without end or measure: but what do they?
They martyr themselves in vain things, and such as God never required, but
utterly mislyketh: and yet in the mean while, there is nothing but hypocrisy
in all their dooyngs. For what does the deuoutest person among them, but only
make much babbling and mumbling? He must here Mattins in the night, and two or
three Masses in a day: He must gad on pilgrimage, and fast the Lent and
Saints euens: He must keep all the apes toys that have bin appointed at the
devise of men. And what are all these things? Surely if men put their trust in
them, they be diuelishe devises: but although there were none other harm in
the^ saving that every man follows his own imaginacions: yet are they but
gewgawes and Apes toys before God. And why? For he loves obedience better
than all sacrifices. But if we will obey God: we must serve him after a
spiritual manner, and not with these chyldishe playing toys. Now let us come
too that which S. Paul says, Circumcision (says he) is nothing: but faith
that woorketh by charity. Hereby he betokens that although Ceremonies be
laid aside, we have enough too occupy our selves with, in dooyng the things
that God commands: that is to wit, that all the perfection and holiness, of
the faithful consists in charity. That is the fulfilling of the Law, that
is the end and shooteanker wherevntoo God brings us. Therefore if we have
charity, let us not think that we be unoccupied. But now a days if a man
rebuke the superstitions of Popery, and skorne them, saying, Go too, ye have
much baggage amongst you: when ye come at Church ye besprinckle your selves
with holiwater, ye kneel down before a puppet, ye skud from alter to alter,
ye do this and that, and to be short there is an endless hotchpotch of al
manner of gewgawes among you: and poor souls as ye be, think ye that these
things will go for payment? No, for God will not allow any of them. They reply
unto it agein and say, why not? Shall God be no more served? What shall we
do for him? Verily it seems to them that unless they go to Mass, and be
shriuen, and pay some ransom, and do one thing or other, there is nothing at
all done. And in deed we see how they leave the principal undone. For even
they that are the deuoutest of them, will not stick at all, some too keep
whores, some to blaspheme God, and some too rob and spoil other men, in so
much that if they which pretend greatest holiness can find occasion too pill
and poll their neybours, they will byte the^ to the bones. Their cruelty shall
be so excessive, that they shall be brute beasts rather than men. Thereunto
they be full of suttletie and wiliness. It is nothing with them too forswear
themselves, if they may beguile any man by it. For they nuzell themselves in
all kind of leawdnesse, bearing themselves in hand that God must serve them
for a cloak when they fall once too making of fair countenances, that it may
be said they be devout or holy folk. Math. 21. b. 13.
Ye see then that this hypocrisy is as a den of thieves, as our Lord Jesus
Christ himself terms it. And it is an ordinary matter for men to forget the
chief principal, when they give themselves to Ceremonies, according also as
our Lord Jesus vpbraydeth them, Mat. 15 a. 3.
saying: for your own traditions sakes you have abolished the law of God my
father. Psa. 50. c. 13.
And for the same cause it is said in the fifth Psalm. Think thou that I
will drink the blood of brute beasts? If I be hungry (says God) think
thou that all is not mine? This is the thing that I would have thee to offer
unto me, namely the sacrifice of praise.

Now we see Paul's meaning. He mocketh the hypocrites which think that all is
mard if there be not store of gawdes, and gewgawes when men should go unto
God, and that they may not go to him as it were with banner displayed.
According whereunto we see how they pranke up things with pomp, of lamps,
perfumes, and tapers, gay disguised cotes, puppets, and such other things.
When they have this geere once, to their own seeming they be so well cloked,
that God knows no more what they do, and that their vices are well sheltred
under such shadow: and yet for all that, they do but spite him openly. Now S.
Paul laugheth that opinion too scorn, saying, that although we have none of
al those pomps, there is enough besides wherewith (...) God to keep us
occupied, and that is charity. But to be short, S. Paul meant to tell us
here, that Gods service is spiritual. For when we love our neybours, it is a
token that we love God. I mean when we love them according to Gods ordinance.
For it is no love too love a man for our own profits sake, but to love even
our enemies, so as we be patient to bear the wrongs that are done us, so as we
streine ourselves to do good too such as have need of our help, and so as none
of us be given to himself nor to his own peculiar profit, but that we indeuer
as members of one body to help each other as much as is possible. If we be
once at that point, then does our life sufficiently answer for us, and witness
that we love God. But we cannot love him before we know him. Therefore is
charity an infallible sign and token that we be willing to serve God, not in
paying him with chafe in sted of corn, but by loving our neybor truly and
unfeignedly. And so let the Papists brag as much as they list of their gewgawes
and gay shows wherewith they think to cousin God, as it were to make a
mockingstocke of him: yet shall the thing that is uttered here by S. Paul's
mouth stand always sure, that is too with, that such things are naughtworth
before God. And why? For if Circumcision were abolished when the time and term
of it was expyred: what shall become of the things that have bin foolishly and
malapertly forged in the shoppes of men's own fancies, which took upon them
that which belonged not too them, nor was by any means lawful for them to
do? Ye see then what we have too bear in mind. But before we go any
further, we must assoyle a doubt which the Papists cast here. For to their
seeming it makes wholly on their side when S. Paul says, that faith which
woorketh by charity is the thing that makes all the faithful perfect. And
thereupon they conclude, that only faith does not purchase us grace, but
faith and charity matched together. Put the case it were so: whereto would it
serve them? For whereupon do they ground their merits, but upon childishe
toys? as who should say they would appease God with a Rattle: but S. Paul's
meaning is far otherwise. For although he have hitherto showed the true way
how too be in Gods favor: yet notwithstanding he minds not too ground our
righteousness or our hope (...) ^aluation upon charity.

What then? It is enough for him too show that God can find means ynow to
keep the faithful occupied, although they have no Ceremonies, wherewith the
hypocrites beguile themselves, in making that their principal. To be short,
we see that S. Paul is so far off from favoring the Papists any thing at
all, that he fights directly against them Now under the color of that which
is spoken here, they have imagined that faith is but a single knowledge that
there is a God, and that his only son Jesus Christ is come into the world for
the redeeming and saving of mankind, notwythstanding that the same knowledge
be without any affection, more than if a man should tell us some story, and
we should believe it and hold it for a certeintie. After that manner do the
Papists speak of faith, and say that when faith is all alone, it has not yet
her full shape before God: but when it is joined with a hearty good will and love
of God, then is it full fashioned say they. But when the scripture speaks to
us of faith, it means the knowledge that is given us by the holy Ghost: not
which flittereth in our own brain, but which is sealed in our hearts, in such
wise as God must needs have wrought wonderfully in us, before we can have bin
enlightened and fashioned in faith: for there is nothing but darkness in our
minds. The light must come from above. Agein we be utterly inclyned to
distrust* and therefore the holy Ghost must be feign too set this seal upon us,
that we be thoroughly saved by the means of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Furthermore it is not enough too know generally that Christ is our Redeemer:
but faith imports that every of us must acknowledge him too be his Redeemer.
And is that possible too be unless our Lord Jesus do dwell in us and reygne
in us, and that we be inflamed with the love of him too give ourselves wholly
unto him? The Papists therefore never wist what faith means, notwithstanding
that they chatter of it not altogether so well as Pyes in a Cage, which do yet
understand some words here and there: but they show so shameful a
beastliness, as they may be gazingstockes of Gods horrible vengeance, in that
they have so forgotten the whole Phrase of the holy Ghost, and have no more
skill of the holy scripture, than a Paynim or a Turk that has bin always in
^^^athennesse, and never herd of God the father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Lo
in what taking the Papists are. Now then let us mark well, that S. Paul has
not here imagined a shapelesse or unfashioned faith as they do: nor meant too
set down charity as the cause of our righteousness: but only intended to
show that we have enough to serve God with, without snarling of our selves in a
sort of pelting trifles. Howbeit, that we may fare the better by this text,
(for we must now come too an end, and the time will not suffer us too
proceed any further) if the Papists now adays do make their bragges that
they have a more apparent service of God than we, and a service that has a
gayer gloss: let us on our side be well advised that we despise euerywhit of
it. For why? God will not be served after me^^ lykings. Mark that for one
point. Besides this, the things which the Papists call Gods service, are
pelting trifles imagined and forged in their own brain, so that it is all
rejected, notwithstanding that men do greatly delight in them and like well of
them. And therefore let us have an eye too serve God as he commands. VVherin
will he have us to be occupied? Not in needelesse things: but he will have a
true trial of us, which deceyueth not. And what shall that be? To walk
uprightly and faithfully with our neyghbors, every of us to help where need
is according to his ability: that no man be given wholly to himself: that we
be trusty: that we deal soundly and faithfully: that we live peasably: and
that if we see any man destitute of succor and too stand in need of our
help, we in that case do as it were offer a sacrifice unto God, knowing
that he calls us too it, to show what love we bear toward him. For if we
love not our neybours which are as it were visible grounds too work kyndnesse
upon, how shall we love God (says S. John in his Epistle) whom we see not,
1. John. 4. d. 20.
and which is absent from us and has no need of any thing? Therefore if we
will serve God well: let us learn too yield him such obedience as he lyketh
of: that is too say, let us walk in such faythfulnesse, and freendlinesse as
none of us beguyle, fleece, or ouerreach his neighbor: and moreover that we
not only absteyne from all wrongful or wicked dealing: Math. 23. c. 23.
but also that all such as are called Christians, do well bethink them of our
Lord Jesus Christ's saying, which is, Cursed be you that have your several
devotions alone by your selves, and occupy your heads about small trifles,
making conscience of every thing, and yet in the mean while leave the
principal points of the law undone, that is too wit, faithfulness, Justice,
righteousness, and mercy. As if he should say, Is it not a strange thing
that me^ should so mock with God, making a countenance to honor him, as
though they took him but for a babe? God will have me^ to walk faithfully and
uprightly, he will have every man to pity and to succor the needy, he will have
no man to do his brother wrong: and behold, they on the contrary part will
needs buzie themselves about Mooneshine in the water, and things of no value.
They will be full of cruelty craft and maliciousness: and yet think to
pacify God with things of nothing. Therefore let us learn to serve God with
charity, that is to say, let us learn to give ourselves to the things that he
calls us to, and to hold ourselves as it were at a stay too the rule which he
gives us by his word. Furthermore when we walk uprightly after that fashion,
we must not for men's sakes forget God. For (as I said before) that is the thing
wherein he tries our charity: and by that means we show the reverence and
love that we bear toward him. And therefore we cease not to call upon God
when we love our neyghbors, another intend we to displease God under color of
doing them service, but he is always our mark on whom we have our eyes
fastened. Nevertheless, too conclude, like as we indeuer to live as God
commands by his word, and pass not for the gawdies, gewgawes, and
Ceremonies of the hypocrites, but walk rightly in pureness of life, and in all
faithfulness and upright dealing (as I said erst) knowing nevertheless that
when we have done all, it serves not to justify us or too purchase us favor
in his sight, and that although we be sure that he takes in good worth the
willingness which we have to honor him, yet his so doing is but because he
accepts us in our Lord Jesus Christ, (as I have declared heretofore) and
because we repose the trust of our salvation in him. Even so also shall we walk
in charity and labor to discharge our duty, knowing that by reason of our
feebleness we be not able to come near that which God points us to, but yet
that we be in the way thitherward, and that he must be feign too take us to
mercy, whereupon we doubt not but that all our works do like him well, when they
be so dedicated too him by the blud of our Lord Jesus Christ: for he is the
true priest that offers up our oblations and makes the^ acceptable to God,
and he must be feign to step in, to make our works pleasant to God his father,
specially seeing that eue^ our prayers and the very praises which we yield unto
him should be but filthiness, if they were not purified by our Lord Jesus
Christ, Heb. 13. c. 15.
according also as the Apostle says, that it is he by who^ we offer up unto
God the Calves of our lips, that is to say, the sacrifices of praise whereby
he is glorified.

But now let us fall down before the Majesty of our good God with
acknowledgment of our faults, praying him to make us perceive the^ more and
more, and that we may be so touched with the^, as it may bring us to true
repentance, and that we may seek all our wants in our Lord Jesus Christ, and
that there may be such humility in us, that being utterly brought down, and
having put away al false presumptuousnesse wherewith we may be deceived, we
may not tend to any other end than to be received through the mere mercy of
our God, so as we may come to the everlasting inheritance, and in the mean
while indeuer to walk in such wise in his commandments, as it may please him
to bear with our frailty, till he have quite and clean rid us of it. And
so let us all say Almighty God heavenly father. etc.

The.xxxiij. Sermon, which is the third upon the fifth Chapter.
7 Ye ran well, who has let you that ye should not obey the truth?

8 That counsel came not of him that called you.

9 A little Leven sovvreth a whole lump of dovve.

10 I have hope of you through the Lord, that ye vvil be none otherwise
minded. But he that troubles you shall bear his judgment whatsoever he be.


We know that God has set down such a rule for us too live by, that if we
give ear too his word, we shall not be subject to walking at rouers, but sure
to hold the right way. And that is a thing wherein the faithful differ from
the faithless. For all such as submit themselves to Gods word, are not in any
doubt or disputation with themselves, whither their doyngs are allowable or no:
for who has power too judge of that matter but only God? But he has given
his sentence already. So then forasmuch as man's life is lykened too a race:
let us learn too follow whither soever God calls us, and then shall we not
stray as wretched wanderers that do greatly ouertrauell and tire themselves
without any profit. And for that cause also does Saint Paul in this text set
down a dubble race, the one good which has a right direction, and the other
wandering and uncertain. Now it is not enough for men too take great peynes:
but they must also ^ame at a certain end. Moreover we see herewithall a true
difference between the race that is to be counted good, and the race that does
but ouerlabor men in vain. For S. Paul lays them forth certainly and
infallibly, saying that all such as obey the truth do run well. Lo here a
saying of great weyghte. For therevppon we may gather, that when men be
given too their own fancies, or walk only by guess, or receive all that is
told them without discretion or skill: they may run swiftlye enough, but
they shall come never the nearer unto God. When they have spent all their
life in traueling, they shall find themselves further off than they were at the
first. And therefore let us learn to begin at this point, that is to wit, to
give ear unto God who does us the grace and honor too teach us, assuring
our selves that there is none other truth but that which proceeds of him, and
that when me^ follow the devises of their own brain, it shall be but untruth
and leasing. Ye see then that the way for us too fare the better by this
saying of S. Paul's, is first of all too consider, that all the devotions
which men do frame of their own heads, are but mere illusions of Satan, and
that all such as do what they like best themselves, may run fast enough,
howbeit they shall be never the further forward in the right way, but rather
the further back. Then is nothing too be taken and allowed for a good course
or race, but only the obedience which we yield unto Gods truth. Were this
thoroughly well known to the world now a days, there would not be so much
trouble and contention as is seen. For what is the cause that we draw not
all by one line, and that every of us reaches not out his hand to his
neighbor? It is for that most men cannot be persuaded to obey God. Therefore
the true course of the faithful is well showed to us by the Prophet Esaias when
he says, Esa. 2. a. 3.
that every man shall take his fellow by the hand, and say, Go we, let us go up
too the Lords hill, and he will teach us his ways. Now were we fully
resolved of this point, so as we were altogether willing and desirous to
submit our selves to God: it is certain that we should all of us run
together, and the foremost should help forward the hindermost, and the weaker
sort should not envy such as were their guides, yea and that would give them
courage to go on. But although we see the world full of stubbornness, and every
man given to his own liking, yet must we profit our selves by this doctrine:
that is too wit, by imprisoning our senses, that we take not a licentious
liberty too do what we list, but that we obey the truth, assuring our
selves that the foundation whereupon it behooves us too build, is the said
faithful obedience which we yield unto Gods word. And whereas S. Paul
uses this word Truth, it is specially to beat down all foolish
presumptuousnesse and ouerweening, because men bear them selves in hand that
they be wise enough to order their own life. And out of this overboldness
sprang also the Seagulfe of all superstitions. For if men knew them selves too
be such as they be in deed, that is to wit, to be poor, blind, and
ignorant: it is certain that they would with all humbleness hearken unto
God, and then should not there be so many partakings and sects as there be.
But what? As I said before, men will needs be ouerwyse. Now S. Paul, too
pull down all loftiness, and to rid us of all pride and presumption, says
that there is no truth to be found but in the doctrine that comes (...)
God, and that how sure so ever we ween our selves to be, there is nothing
but mere folly in us, except God govern us, and Gods word reign wholly over
us. Further let us understand, that to yield our selves techable is a far
greater virtue without all comparison, than to enter into disputation, and to
be inquisitiue of things that belong not to us, nor are lawful for us. It is
true that faith is not a dotage or sottishness to receive and believe without
gaynsaying, whatsoever shall be told us: but yet when God speaks, it
behooves us too yield him so much honor, as to keep our mouths shut, and to
open our ears to herke^ advisedly to that which he tells us, and to frame
our selves simply to the same. Ye see then that the good race wherein we can
not go amiss, nor be carried aside one way nor other, is to follow the way
that god shows us by his word. Otherwise (as I said) we shall but roue,
according also as S. Paul uses the self same similitude, in taunting all the
things that the ignorant and unbelievers do to serve God withal. For although
they take never so much pain, yet they do but loose their labor. But by the
way let us mark also how he blames the Galathians for turning aside in the
midst of their race, saying that their fault is so much the less to be
excused, in that they had begone well, and not hild out likewise to the end.
True it is that even the ignorantest in the world shall not fail to be
condemned if they follow not Gods word: but howsoever they fare, we offend much
more grossly, when God has once bin so gracious unto us as to call us unto him,
and to show us his will. Then if we turn head, and forsake our holy calling
from heaven after we have bin taught in Gods schole, and entered into the way:
surely our fault is double, and we deserve much sorer punishment. This is it
that S. Paul meant in this text by saying, how now? You ran well. Surely this
forwardness of faith is a great virtue, namely when we be ready to answer
God as soon as he speaks the word to us: but yet is it nothing worth without
holding out. Then if we be so fickle and inconstant, that when we have gone
forward a step or twain, we be ready to run back again, or else to start
out on the one side or on the other: such unthankfulness is much more
shameful, than if we had never harkened to God at all: for we can not (...)
^ore sheelde our selves by ignorance, as they do which are bred and brought up
in error and misknowledge, who will say, if we knew which is the truth, we
would not do so as we should need to be pulled by the ear: but we be in
doubt, and we wot not on which side to turn us. Then if they which have
begone to follow God, yea and have had some certain and infallible
instruction by his word, do afterward starte aside, or go back again: do
they not show that they do it not of ignorance, but of wilfulness and
stubbornness, as though they mente of set purpose to spyte God? Now it behooves
us to mark well this thing, specially for so much as God is so gracious unto
us, as too show us which is the way of salvation, which thing he does not
too the rest of the world. For we see many blind wretches, that run and
trotte up and down, and wot not what they do: but yet they show some desire
of serving God. If a man ask them whether they think they do well, or no,
they answer, yea: howbeeit it is but a weening, they be not sure of it. But
we on our side have the warrant of the holy Ghost, which ought too be
sealed in our hearts, that the doctrine which is preached unto us is not
devised by men, but that God is the very author of it. The holy Scripture is
sufficiently proved: we know, without adding of any thing, that God is our
guide, so that now a days there is not so very a dullarde or idiote, but he
is justly too be condemned, if he receive not the doctrine that is preached
and set forth, and may upon his own knowledge judge that he does
manifestly make wylfull war against God. Seeing that our Lord has done
us the prerogative too call us too him, and does still daily allure us and
incorage us to come forward, till we be come to our races end: if we be
weery to hear him, and every of us would feign take his own scope, to follow
whatsoever his own lust likes: what excuse or shift can we hope to have,
that we should not be condemned with the Galathians, for falling to our own
byasse after we have run well, and bin well forward on our way? Yea and we
must also mark this saying which S. Paul interlaceth, Who has let you,
says he? He might have said simply as he said in the beginning of the
Epistle* that they were quyte gone away, yea and utterly revolted as Apostates
or backslyders. But he uses the word Let, too show that it is not enough for
us not to turn quite and clean away from God, but that if we do but stop
or linger that we go not right forth on still, nor continue always
steadfastly in coming nearer and nearer unto God: it is already a very
dangerous matter. So then let us be ware of Satan's wyles, and not only be
afraid of utter reuolting from the obedience of our God, but also bear well
in mind, that when the Devil shall once have cooled us, and made us too slake
our pace, so as we fall to loytering in our gooing: he shall have gained over
much at our hands. Thus ye see in effect what we have to gather upon this text.
Now to condemn the unthankfulness of the Galathians the better, he adds,
that that counsel came not of him that called them. In the first chapter he
had said, I marvel that ye be so soon carried away from Jesus Christ which
called you to the grace of his Gospel. For it is good reason that God should
be heard when he opens his holy mouth to teach us. What are we? VVretched
worms of the earth, and rottenness: and yet notwithstanding our Lord makes
his voice to ring from heaven, to assure us that if he inlighten and guide us,
we can not do amiss, and therefore that we must depend wholly upon him, and
rest upon his truth. But if we give ear to this and that, and when God
speaks we be soaring in the air, and hearken to one that whistleth, and to
another that sings: Is it not too shameful an unthankfulness? If a
Scholemaster see his scholars prattling together while he speaks to them, or
buylding of Castles in Spain, so as they hear not what he says: the rod
must be feign too walk among them, and good right it should so. Verily a man
can not abide that his mate or companion should muse upon other matters when
he is talking with him, but he will take it in scorn and derision. But
behold, God calls us, and yet if there come any deceyuer to whisper us in
the ear, we hearken too him and follow his counsel: which is a token that
there was never any knowledge in us too discern the majesty of our God, and
too yield him the reverence that he deserves. We know that the chief honor
that he requires (...), is to have our wits and minds bent to understand
what he commands and appoynteth. For that cause therefore S. Paul says,
that the said counsel came not of God, who had called the Galathians. Now it
is certain that he had called them long before that time: Nevertheless he
thinks it not enough to have told us once for all how we should walk: but
also he holds on still, according also as we have need too have the
remembrance of that doctrine to be renewed daily. Then seeing it is so that God
is always at hand with us, yea (as the Prophet Esaias says, Esa. 65. a. 2
both early and late, that is to say, seeing he has a continual care to
bring us to him self, and to draw us nearer and nearer: it is certain that
our fault is so much the haynouser if we have one of our ears in the field,
and the other in the town, as the Proverb says, and that we be not wholly
given too him and to his word. To be short, we see here that the true
perfection of Gods children, is too offer up themselves wholly unto him, and to
suffer themselves to be governed after a peaceable manner with all
teachablenesse, so as none of the^ say, this is mine opinion, this is my
fancy, this have I learned of men: but always prefer the obedience of faith
before all things. For there is none other lamp to guide us aright, than Gods
word. Mark that for one point. Now after that S. Paul has spoken so: he
adds, that a little Leven marreth a whole lump of Dowe. This serves to
confirm the matter which I touched not long since: which is, that it is not
enough for us, not to make any full reuolting from God, and to forsake him
utterly, and to renounce al his word: but that we must also continue pure and
sound, and be as it were untrussed to put ourselves more and more forward, and
although Satan devise and practice too cast blocks and bars in our ways to
stop us, yet must we not cease to go on forth still. And this is to be
marked the better, because the devil shewe^h not his horns at the first (as
they say) to withdraw us away from God, but transformeth him self into an
Angel of light, and creeps upon us by bypathes and mines under the ground.
And by that means are we beguyled. For to our seeming, this or that is no
great matter, by means whereof we ouerleape it lightly, and strike sail as
they say. But we be utterly amazed when the Devil hold (...) us masked in
his nets. Too be short, S. Paul meant too say here, that when men have
learned the Gospel, it is not enough for them to profess the receiving of the
doctrine that is contained there: but they must also have a pure, sound, and
substantial faith, and not swerve aside too the right hand nor to the left,
nor be corrupted with any error, nor admit any mingling, but hold fast the
pure truth which God shows us. This is the sum of the matter which we have
to gather upon this text. But if ever this warning were necessary, it is
necessary at this day. For Satan straynes him self too the uttermost, too
entangle, yea and too embrace Gods word, too the end that men might no more
discern between white and black, but that al Religions whatsoever men list
to have, might be taken for good. And such as use that cunning do serve the
devil, and have no more fear of God nor Religion, than dogs have. Now a
days they that be the best vpholders of the Pope, perceiving well that their
abuses have bin so gross and out of all square, as it is impossible to
maynteyne them, say, very well, yet must ye not seek such a reformation, as
to break of the Eele by the wast as they say: men must be contented with some
good mean. And all this is but too cover their filthiness, as if a man that
would pluck up a venomous weed, should but nippe off some leaves of it, and
say, Lo, now it is as good as cut up. Yea but the root is still behind
together with the residue of it, which is able to do harm inoughe, and that
is all one as if it had not bin touched at all. Nevertheless the world now a
days is full of such vermin and corruption: for we see that these sticklers
and neuters which row between two streams, would feign disguize our Lord
Jesus Christ after such a sort, as he should be Jack out of office, and be no
more known, and that the doctrine of the Gospel might be mingled like a
hotchpotch. And so much the more does it stand us in hand to mark well the
thing that is told us here by the holy Ghost, namely that a little Leven
soureth a whole batch of Dowe. Sometime this similitude is applied to men: for
one scabbed sheep is inoughe too infect a whole flock, as they say. But
Saint Paul speaks now of doctrine, as if he should say, that we must
hold our own, and not suff^^ any thing to be added to Gods pure word, 2.
Co. 11. a. 3
according as we have seen in the second to the Corinthians, how he said that
such as give ear to Satan's illusions, are like a woman that hearkeneth to a
baude, whose coming is to beguile and abuse her. Now as soon as we be so
corrupted in our faith: by and by we be alienated from our Lord Jesus Christ,
and we break the promise of marriage which is made betwixt him and us, as soon
as we swerve aside from the simplicity of the Gospel. And like as in that
place he uses the word simplicity of set purpose: so in this place he says,
that if we mingle never so little leven with the dow, by and by it is all made
sour. What must we do then? Whereas it pleased God to show the Jews by
his law the true mean to walk in such wise as they should not be harried
here and there: in the Gospel he has taught us yet with much greater
perfection, because that there he has made an end of all prophesies. Then
seeing it is so: let us now frame our selves thereafter. And although Satan
whisper us on either side, let us not be as reeds that are shaken with every
wind, but let us be so rooted in our Lord Jesus Christ, as he may make us to
endure al winds and wethers by the power of faith, and all assaults that can
be put unto us. To be short, if we will be taken for Disciples of our
Lord Jesus Christ: let us not hearken too any other master or teacher than
him: for we can not do him greater wrong than to add any thing to that which
he brings us. For it is said that it is he whom the father has set over us
with full pre-eminence, and which is the good shepherd, Job. 10. a. 4
and that they which are of his flock, will hear his voice, and eschew the
voice of strangers. Howsoever the world go, we must stand whist at that stay,
and without resistance follow whither soever God calls us, and suffer our
selves to be so turned and returned by, as we may desire nothing but too submit
our selves to his word as I have declared before. And therefore although that
now and then men find fair clokings to vernish the minglings withal which
they put forth: yet let us hold us to that which is said here, namely that a
little Leven is enough too mar a whole batche of dowe: according as we shall
see many, who too make us swerve aside, will allege, what? It is no
renouncing of Jesus Christ, so we hold the grounds of the Gospel, that we
be justified by the free goodness of God, and that we can call upon him in
the name of him that has promised too be our mediator. When we have done
amiss we flee too the only and everlasting sacrifice of our Lord Jesus
Christ; and if there be any small spots or wemmes beside, they must be
borne with and winked at. And specially such as would win by their pride,
will say, yea mary Sir, and what else seek we but concord? For we be
contented that every man should walk in the doctrine of the Gospel: but yet
is not that a matter of so great importance, that it should be so greatly
stood upon. Therefore when the Devil goes about to beguyle us with such
baytes, let us always set this buckler against him, that a little Leven
sowreth a whole lump of Dowe. And in very deed even experience (which is
termed the mistress of fools) has well showed in our time how true this
Saint Paul's saying is. For we see now a days that where the Gospel has
bin preached purely, there are so many diverse opinions as it is horrible too
think, so as it seems daily that all should go too ruin, and Gods truth
is as it were torn in pieces. And whereof comes this, but of men's laziness
in that they would maynteyne them selves in rest, and have their commodities
and ease at will, too take their pleasure euerywhere, and so have consented too
such as came too disguyse the pureness of the Gospel? God therefore has
yielded them their deserved hyre. For as much then as we see such examples,
let us be so much the warer, and let us so walk in the pureness of the
Gospel, as we may refuse all mingling, and utterly abhor it. Now heerevpon
Saint Paul adds further, that he trusts of the Galathians, that they
will not be otherwise minded. We have seen how the rebukes that he did set
down hitherto heretofore, were rough and sharp. Now when men exceed
measure, it is always dangerous for discoraging of men, and for casting them
into a melancholy. For this cause S. Paul moderateth him self, and seeks
still too be at one again with the Galathians. And in good sooth that is the
order which all men ought to keep, that are desirous too build up Gods
Church. It is true that men's vices ought not to be spared, and specially if
there appear any hinderance of the pure doctrine, or too the overthrowing of
faith: then must we have a fiery zele too fight manfully, and to maynteyne
the quarrel of our God. Yet notwithstanding we must labor to the vttermoste of
our power to bring those back that are gone astray, and to keep still those
that are yet in good way, though they be weak and go not forward with such
strength and courage as were requisite and to be wished. Ye see then what the
duty of those is which have the charge to bear abroad Gods word committed
unto them: that is to wit, that in reproving such as were gone astray, their
using of severity and rigor should be such, as yet nevertheless they should
show some good hope, to the intent that their hearers be not utterly over
grieved, and thereupon fall intoo wilfulness, and shake off all good doctrine.
But every of us must apply this too his own use. For what causes us now and
then to gnash our teeth when God rebukes us, and to be forepossessed with such
stubbornness that we rebel against him? It is because we be past hope, and
thereupon play double or quit as they say. Therefore our Lord laboreth too
bring us back when he sees us so forlorn, or rather in the way of perdition,
and he would still feign win us too himself again, howbeeit that in the mean
while we know not the end and intent that he ameth at. By reason whereof we
shet the gate against him, so as he can not by any means compass us. So much
the more then ought we to mind well the thing that is showed us here by
Saint Paul which is that if our sores be rubbed, although it grieve us and
sting us too be sharply rebuked: yet we must not cease too abide it
patiently, because God meeneth not too throw us headlong intoo the bottomless
pit, but rather calls us home too himself. And now according herevntoo, let
us mark that there is none other remedy for all our vices, than too yield our
selves too that which God tells us. For Saint Paul presupposes that which
was true: namely that he had preached the doctrine of the Gospel purely, and
that he had not intruded himself too put forth his own dreams and dotages,
but had purely discharged his duty and the commission that was given unto
him. He says now that the Galathians will think all that too be so. And so
he shows us generally, that if we have bin ouerseer and the Devil have
troubled our minds, and the deceyuers also have thrust us out of the way:
there is none other help but to hold our peace and to answer Amen unto our
God, and too suffer our selves too be guyded by his word, ceassing not too
yield him true obedience though he come not down from heaven in visible
shape, nor send any of his Angels that bear the badges of his Majesty, but
speak too us by frail men, that are not of any great estimation. Lo here in
effect what we have too bear in mind. Now heerevpon Saint Paul turns
aside the sorest matters unto the Cousiners that had sown their darnell in
the Church of the Galathians. He that has disquieted you (says he) shall
bear his judgment, whatsoever he be. Hereby he declares that if there be
any whom Satan has so sore poisoned, that they wilfully provoke Gods wrath
upon their heads: we must not be shaken down nor moved therewith. This
warning is very necessary. For though we be hard and slow too believe the
things that God tells us: yet notwithstanding on the contrary part, when we
spy any error, we be ready too run after it, and so ye see a froward
inclination, which is common welneere euerywhere, and a vice more than
ordinary. Furthermore to our seeming we be well at ease, if we can get any
covert, too suffer Satan too beguyle us though he seek nothing but our
destruction. Therefore it behooves us so much the more too mark well how it is
said here, that such as trouble the Church shall bear their own judgment.
For thereby S. Paul does us to understand, that there are many despyzers of
God, which make no conscience to pervert all things: so they may win themselves
estimation with the world, and purchase themselves credit, all is one with
them, for they pass for nothing but to exalt themselves. Such manner of men do
trouble the church a thousand ways. There are others who through vain glory
and too seem skillful and sharpwitted, forge new doctrines. That is one other
kind of Cousiners. And there are othersome so malicious and spiteful, as they
can not brook any peace and concord, Genesis 16. c. 12.
according as it is said that the hand of Ismaell should be against all men,
and all men's hands against him. Then there are a sort that seek nothing but
dissension and variance. Seeing then that we perceive that the Diuel^ has so
many bolsterers to turn us from the right way: had not every of us need to
look well to himself, least he be shaken down: and too continue always
steadfast in the thing which we know too be of our God, whatsoever this man
or that man do babble or prate? Ye see then that the thing which Saint
Paul meant, is that we should not one of us look at another, like sheep
which leap one after another intoo a river or a pit when one is leapt in before
them, or like Cranes and other birds that fly all on a row one after
another, no we may not do so: but we must always be constant without
swaruing aside from the word of God. Mark that for one point. But above all
things Saint Paul tells us, that we must not be dazeled at men's gay
shows, when they pervert Gods pure truth under color of their own skill:
but that when we see them too have no regard of any thing, nor religion, no
fear of God, no awe, yea and that sometimes they be worse than paste shame,
so that if they once come so far foreward as too get the Law in their own
hands, they pass for noman, but do after a sort spit even in Gods face: I
say when we see them become such Monsters, we must wayt that God should
execute his justice upon them, and show how much store he sets by the souls
which he has bought so deerly. And that is the cause why he adds purposely
whosoever he be. For here he intended too deface all the gay titles whereof
men vaunt themselves, in setting up their bristles against God. Like as at this
day, whereas the Pope turns Gods truth vpside down, and through Devilish
pride mingleth and mangleth all things: yet notwithstanding he ceasseth not too
call himself the Servant of Gods Servants, the Successor of Jesus Christ, and
the Vicar of Saint Peter. The Bishops also suppose themselves too have a very
lawful title to suppress all knowledge of the truth, in naming themselves
Prelates. But Saint Paul tells us here, that when men are so disguyzed,
they be but Idolles for all that, and God is unchangeable and alters another
his nature nor his mind. Then since it is so: although men were exalted too the
third heaven, yet ought we too take them for stark Diuelles, if they go about
to mingle aught at al of their own deuizing, with the pure simplicity of Gods
word. To be short, we see here all worth^^esse of man beaten down when the
obedience of faith comes in presence. True it is that in civil caces there
has always bin superiority: but yet must God not withstanding govern still
by his word, and his seruis must be ruled thereby, that our faith may be
wholly conformable thereunto: and though all the world should set it self
against it, and heap up never so huge and high mountains of most excellent
titles even up too the clouds, all must be hild but as smoke, yea and as filth
and dung. Thus ye see in effect what Saint Paul meant to say. Yet does he it
not too excuse the Galathians of their vnaduized ouershooting of themselves,
but too give them courage to return unto God. There are many too be seen now
adays which think themselves to be escaped out of Gods hands, and too be
quite discharged, when they can say that their Prelates and Shepeherdes have
taught them so. But S. Paul admits no such excuce, but says that the way
for them to escape the damnation that is prepared for the deceyuers, is to
return to Gods pure truth, and not to refuze to be brought back again,
though they have swarued from it for a time. And herewithall also for a
conclusion, he does us to understand how dear our salvation is to God, and how
great store he sets by it. For whereof comes that which S. Paul says
here, namely that all such as trouble the Church shall give a reckening of
it, and be overwhelmed at Gods hand: but of that we be his heritage, and he
takes all his pleasure in us, as in them whom he has chozen and adopted, and
for that we be as it were his accomplishment, as S. Paul terms us? Seeing it
is so: let us learn to trust in God, seeing he has so fatherly care of our
salvation. And so let us learn to put from us all false doctrine constantly
and with such stoutnesse as we ought to do. For we see that God is chafed and
moved too anger, telling us that he will never pardon those that have so
troubled his. For as much then as we see that God powers out his indignation
upon them that have troubled his Church: let us have a zele answereable
thereunto, and let us abhor all false doctrines. And when we see men
desirous of nothing but too sow some troubles: let us take them as our mortal
enemies, let us make war valiantly against them, and let us fight too the
uttermost for the truth of our God, assuring our selves that that is the thing
wherein lies all our happiness.

Thus ye see in effect what we have to gather upon this streyne. And so for
as much as God has once called us too him, and ceasseth not to prick us
forward daily by exhortations: let us hold us under his obedience. And although
we see many troubles, dissentions, and debates in the world: yet let us always
stick steadfastly to the truth which cannot deceive us. And for as much as we
may be soon seduced and deceived: let us pray God too give us wisdom and
discretion: and also let us give diligent ear to his word, as which is able
to strengthen us against all Satan's illusio^s, and let us no more be led too
dance after other men's pypes, as S. Paul warns us in the end of this
Epistle. Seeing then that we have the mean which God has stablished too hold
us always too be of his house and Church: let us stand steadfast therein. And
if we happen too be turned aside through the foolishness and vnaduizednesse
of our flesh: let us by and by harken to the warnings that are given us here,
let us mourn for our faults, and when we have mourned, let us serve our God,
knowing that he is ever ready too receive us. And although we see never so
great a number of despyzers and worldlings which cease not to corrupt and
pervert the doctrine of the Gospel, yea and too be utterly sotted in their
corruptions: although (I say) that we see such stumblingblockes: yet let us
take good heed, that under the color thereof we be not turned away unto
wickedness, and so be wrapped in the same damnation with them for following of
their steps: but let us go forward to the salvation that is set before us, and
whereunto God provoke us daily to come.

Now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God with acknowledgme^t
of our faults, praying him to make us feel the^ more and more, and therwithall
to bear with our infirmities till he have rid us quite and clean of the^, and
clothed us again with the pureness of his righteousness, which ought too
grow in us until it be fully perfect. And so let us all say, Almighty God our
heavenly father etc.

The. 34. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the fifth Chapter.
11 My brethren, if I preach still the circumcizion, why suffer I yet
persecution? [For] then is the stumblingblocke of the cross put away.

12 I would too God that they which trouble you were cut of.

13 For you, my brethren, were called unto liberty: only make not your
liberty an occasion too the flesh, but serve ye one another through love.

14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, which is this, Thou shall
love thy neighbor as thy self.


IT is seen that men are so given to their own profit in all their doings,
that always they bow crookedly and ouerthwartly without respect of equity and
uprightness. For men's covetousness, and the respect which they have either to
their profit or too their ease, does so blind their eyes, as they can discern
nothing. Specially when Gods word is to be carried abroad, then if a man
forget not himself, and shet not his eyes against the things that may turn him
away in this world from walking purely before God: surely he shall never hold
on his course, but be still starting out, now on the one side and now on the
other. By means whereof Gods doctrine is oftentimes corrupted, because that
they which ought too bear it abroad, are inclyned either too hatred or favor,
and are afraid of purchacing themselves some displeasure, or of provoking some
anger against them. Therefore it is impossible too serve God purely in our
state of calling, unless we be fully resolved, yea even with an invincible
constancy, not to be grieved if we be driven to suffer for the doctrine which
we bear abroad: but to fight lustily under the standard of our Capteyne Jesus
Christ, knowing that we cannot come to the glory of his resurrection, but by
suffering aforehand with him after his example. The faithful must be feign to
fashion themselves unto that. But the case of such as should teach and have the
office of preaching Gods word, is more particular: for it is certain that the
Devil is always practizing too put us out of heart, and he shall find
furtherers enough in this world, according as there are full many that cannot
abide that Gods word should be preached purely and incorruptly. They will not
say with open mouth, that Gods name ought to be buried: but yet would they
feign deuyze a fashion of doctrine too their own lyking. Now therefore it
behooves us too look simply too that which God commands, and to harden our
selves thoroughly to it: according also as we se how Jeremy was willed to
fight, Ierem. 1. d. 18. 19.
and God promized too give him a forehead of brass, to push against those that
should come to assail him. And for that cause does S. Paul say now, that if
he listed to preach circu^cizion, and to make such a minglema^gle as the
deceivers went about to do: he could rid his hands of al vexation, and make
every man to clap their hands at him, or at leastwise he could bring too pass
that no man should persecute him and trouble him. For the Jews would easly hue
granted that Jesus Christ should have bin preached, so they might have hild
still the state of Eldership, and the Ceremonies have bin used still, and the
Gentiles have bin as little untimely borne things to come in array in their
train behind the^. Ye see then what the Jews desire was. Saint Paul could
have pleased them well in so doing, but that he minded too serve God faithfully
and substantially. But on the contrary part S. Paul shows, that they which
labored too overthrow the doctrine that he had preached, sought more the
favor and friendship of men, than too discharge their duty. Now then we see
what is meant by this sentence where he says, My brethren, if I preached
Circumcizion still, that is too say, if I would agree too make a minglemangle,
that Jesus Christ might be disguyzed, and every man have what he would ask:
no man would be any more offended with me, I should be welcome euerywhere, and
I should have credit by it. But now, is it likely that I will be at defiance
with all the world, of purpose too be tormented? You see then at a word,
that I seek not mine own profit. For what moves these goodly doctors to
make such a minglemangle as ye see, but that they would feign pleasure every
man, and are loath that any man should trouble ^^em in any wise? Seeing that
their seeking is for ease and commodity: you ought of good right to suspect
them. Now then we see here, on the one side the thing that I touched not long
since: namely that all such as are called of God to the preaching of his word,
ought to be fully determined upon this, that although the whole world should
step up against them, yet they would not bow, but abide all assaults, being
well assured that God will maynteyne them at their need, and always give them
victory, so they follow their vocation in pure singleness. For we cannot
do God any greater wrong and outrage, than too submit our selves too men's
likings, by turning away from his word, either to the right hand or to the
left. Another is it for us to leave any piece of our duty undone, but we must
steadfastly maynteyne the truth of God which is unchangeable, and ought not in
any wise to be altered, though men be never so variable and unconstant. And
this is to be marked well, because that although men have some good
willingness that God should be known, and that his truth should be preached
accordingly: yet the most part will commonly bow, when they see the slanders
that are rayzed of the^, and here men's grudgings and repinings against them,
specially when sometimes there shall be so great broils, that all is like to
go to wrecke. For if we maynteyne Gods quarrel as we ought too do, by and by
the slaunderers will give it out that we be wilful. Like as at this day the
Papists do charge us, first of all with great rashness, that we, (who be but a
ha^dfull in comparison of themselves which are so houge a multitude, yea and
me^ of so great experience, which have seen so much, and are had in so great
estimation and reputation,) will take upon us to control all the states of the
world: and secondly that we be to precyze, yea and to malapert, in that we
will have all men's heads under our girdle, and do seek nothing else but to
ouermayster all men, and to make every man to stoop to our lure. Lo how we
be wrongfully slaundered. Nevertheless we must rather swallow up this
slander, than forbear the doing of any piece of our duty. For why? in this
behalf it is not for us to make any composition as it were between man and
man. For if two parties be at variance for some sum of Money, or for some
Land, an vmper may so qualify the matter on either side, as peace shall soon
be made betwixt them. But if we grant Gods enemies their own asking,
specially to the prejudice of him that will have his own right thoroughly
maynteyned (as good reason is that it should be:) what a thing is that? So
much the more then behooves it us too mark well this lesson, where Saint Paul
tells us, that to serve God we must not shun, neither trouble, nor vexation,
nor repinings, nor reproaches, nor any thing else, insomuch that if it stand
upon the hazarding of our life, we must go through with it. And though there be
great frailty in us: yet let us consider that God calls us unto him, and
that he is able to remedy al our weakness, and to give us sufficient strength
to hold out to the uttermost. Howsoever the case stand, seeing he imployeth
us in his service, (us I say which are nothing of our selves:) we must not
dishonor him so much, as to make him subject to men's lusts. Thus ye see what
we have to consider in the first place. Furthermore we be warned
therewithal, to suspectall such as seek their own advantage and profit,
and all such as disguise themselves, rowing between two streams, and
falsifying Gods pure truth at every turn, too please men withal. For as I
have told you already, we must prepare our selves to many battles, if we
mind to serve God simply. And we must call to mind this sentence where Saint
Paul said, Gal. 1. b. 10
that if his mind were too please men, he must of necessity forsake the
service of our Lord Jesus Christ his master. For as I have told you before,
the devil will not cease to make war upon us on all sides: and again, men
are naturally disposed thereunto: every man coueteth to be soothed and
vphilde, and to have all his vices cloked. To be short, there is none but he
desires too be foded and mainteyned in his rechlesnesse. And therefore if we
will be friends with men too frame our selves unto their wills and desires:
Jesus Christ can have no more maystership over us, and we shall not only
become unprofitable for him, but also utter peruerters of all. Now therefore
when we see that these which pretend great zealousnesse of christian
religion, do seek their own profit: let us hardily conclude, that they
deserve not to have any authority. Of which sort are they which nowadayes
keep a barking to mainteyne popish abuses, and cease not to slander (...)
doctrine of the Gospel, but labor to bring it in discredit with the blind
and ignorant, and yet notwithstanding what is it that the most part of them do
seek? Some to maintain themselves in their estate, with their red hattes,
horned cappes, and crosses: Others run after them like hounds in a chase,
and these poor storuelings plie them apace that they may have their wages.
Besides this, all that ever is done of these pelting hypocrites, and of all the
whole stinging and stinking rabble of shauelings, (what pretense so ever they
make) tends too none other end, but to have their dishes always full, so that
all their fighting is but for their belly. Also there are a great number of
Neuters, which are contented to have the Gospel preached by halues, but to go
too it with so great rygour and severity, o (say they) it is no reason at all,
for the world cannot away with it. And why should not men pass much for
Ceremonies (say they?) Although they sprung of superstitions and abuses, yet
should we not go too work so roughly: for that were too importunate dealing.
All they then which cannot abide too have the filthy dregs and corruptions
of Popery cut off to the quick, do certainly ame at none other mark, than
too eschew persecution, and too shrink away from it. And would God that
examples of it were not too ryfe. But nowadayes ye shall see an infinite number
of such as would be ashamed to withstand the Gospel in all respects, consent
well enough with us to say, In deed it is true, but yet many things had need
to be borne withal, and we had need to go to it with gentleness and
modesty. And what moves them to this? What foundation have they? See I pray
you what they allege. O (say they) we see fires kindled every where: and
what a thing were it too move yet further troubles that should make them
greater? It should seem that we be bent of set purpose to provoke those that
are already enemies to the Gospel, and have the sword in their hand, and
are able to rende all up by the root: were it not better too bear with things
awhile, till God had given some rest too his Church? It is certain therefore
that such folk as desire too make truce with those that fight openly against
our Lord Jesus Christ, are full of treason. And so see ye the second warning
that is to be marked upon this text. Furthermore when (...) S. Paul says,
that the stumbling block of the Cross shall be done away he meeneth that the
world shall no more be so provoked to refuse the doctrine of the Gospel: for
when we preach Jesus Christ crucified simply without any mixture, that does he
purposely name the preaching of the Cross. Now the world would always feign
have solemnities, and first of all we see that many men's ears itche, and
they desire nothing but that men should flourish in Rhetorike and painted
speech, and such other like things. Again we see that many are ashamed of the
simplicity of the Gospel, because that if the great and small should be
coupled together, it might seem that it tends too the pulling down of all
highness. And should men be spoiled and robbed after that manner of all
their glory [thinke they?] Many therefore are ashamed of that. Now for this
cause Saint Paul says, Go too, it is the preaching of a Gibet or Gallows.
It is true: for to the intent to open unto us the Kingdom of heaven, the son
of God was feign to suffer our curse, and to endure that death which is so
slanderous before men, yea and to be cursed of Gods own mouth according to
the saying of the Law, Cursed is he that hangs on tree. Deuteronomy. 51. d. 23.
Then was our Lord Jesus Christ feign to come to that point, that he might be
our borrow. To be short, he was as good as overwhelmed. And we see how the
Prophet Esaias says of him, Esa. 53. a. 2.
that he was disfigured like a poor Lazerman, so as men vouchsafed not to
look upon him, or to count him in the number of men. Psa. 22. b. 7
Also we see how the.xxij. Psalm says, I am a worm and not a man, Luc. 23.
c. 39
I am a mockingstocke even to the rascallest sort: insomuch that the thief did
scorn him and scoff at him. Well then, at the first sight this doctrine
seems unworthy to be received. 1. Co. 1. c. 21.
But we must bethink us what Saint Paul says in another text: that is to
wit, that the world knew not God in true wisdom, and therefore he was feign to
use another fashion of teaching, which is by foolishness. For were we
thoroughly wise, as we would be taken too be: we have as good an
instruction as can be, in beholding the skies and the earth. We see there a
mirror wherein god shows us his infinite goodness, power, righteousness,
mercy and wisdom. And so we see there the great treasures of Gods wisdom,
which ought (...) ravish our wits to wonder at it. But who fares the better
by it? Nay contrariwise we see men cobble up Gods benefits and fill their
panches with them, without any thinking upon him at all, and not only that,
but also to kick against him that has pampered them. And when they ween too
do God service, they pluck away the honor that belongs to him, and set up
Idols after their own fancy. Seeing then that the world has not known God in
true wisdom, and by the order of nature: God was feign to try another way,
as he did. For if we judge after our natural wit, it is a kind of stark folly
to say, that the son of God, the head of the Angels, the Lord of glory,
the welspring of life, the person to whom all majesty belongs, was not
only made a mortal man, and clothed with our state: but also utterly abased,
Phil. 2. a. 7.
(as Saint Paul says in the second too the Philippians) yea and became
subject too our curse, and bare the name of sin, which is more. When a man
speaks to us in such phraze of speech, it must needs seem strange to us as
it is in deed. But we must submit our selves with all lowliness, and consider
that forasmuch as we have not profited by the things that god has showed us
from the beginning both in heaven and earth, we must be feign to come to this
other schole. Thus much concerning this streyne where Saint Paul says, then
is the stumblingblocke of the Cross put away. But to be short, we must gather
upon this Text, that if there be any absurdity in the Gospel according to our
understanding, the same must not make it out of taste with us, but we must
consider that God intends to try our obedience, by sending us to the death
of of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that there we see as it were the gulf of
hell, seeing that the son of God is there to bear our condemnation, and is
become our surety there to pay all our dettes. Again let us consider further,
that from death there was a goodly passage unto glory, which appeared in his
resurrection. For the Son of God having suffered through infirmity, (that is
to say, according to the ordinance of God his father, and according to his own
good will also, whereby he consented to submit himself to such bondage) and
having suffered in such wise that he overcame death by the power of his holy
spirit: he obtained such a victory, as all knees must now bow before him,
and he has a name above all names, and men must know that all the Majesty
of God appeared and shone forth in his person. Thus ye see that we need not
to be ashamed of the Gospel. And above all things let us hold fast that
which Saint Paul in the first to the Romans calls the power of God to the
salvation of all believers. To. 1. b. 16.
Then as for the worldlings and such as are swollen with pride and ouerweening
like Toades, let them despize the Gospel as much as they list, and let them
perish in their own cursednesse: and in the mean while let us with all
humbleness of faith embrace the son of God, who offers himself to us of
purpose, to lift us up to the glory of the kingdom of heaven. But here is yet
more: namely that Saint Paul matcheth Stumbling, and the preaching of the
Gospel together as things inseparable. It is true that we must eschew all
stumblingblockes as much as is possible: Mat. 18. a. 7.
for woe be to him by whom stumblingblockes come. But yet must Jesus Christ
reign, and have his full scope, though all the whole world should stumble at
him. The word Stumblingblocke, imports a stop, hinderance, or let, as if
there were a rough and stony way that had some thorns and bushes, or some
other comberances in it, the same were a means too make men stumble. Now it
were to be wished that Jesus Christ might go on freely, and that all the world
would receive him, and that nothing might stop the preaching of the Gospel
from the one end of the world to the other. I say we ought to wish it as
much as in us is. Howbeeit let us learn that God intends to try the
obedientnesse of our faith, by giving Satan the bridle who casts many
stumblingblockes and cumberances in our ways. Esa. 8. c. 14
Too be short, our Lord Jesus Christ is not without cause called a stone to
stumble at, and a stop for all men too dashe against, and by that means too
break their necks. Luc. 2 e. 34
And in the end (as it is said in Saint Luke) they must be crushed by that
stone, for it is to hard for their stubbornness. And this is very much for
our behoof. For we see many men so nice, that if men agree not to the Gospel
out of hand, they think themselves quite and clean discharged and set free
before God, from mainteining the quarrel or case any longer. If all Kings and
Princes had caused it to be proclaimed by the sound of a trumpet, that there
should (...) no more fighting against Gods truth: every man would make
countenance too be of the same mind. But nowadayes ye shall see great
cruelty, tyranny, spytefulnesse, manacing, and such other like things. Again
ye shall see that the most part of the enemies are as greedy woolues that
desire to devour all, and seek to shed innocent blood, to the intent that they
may have their goods. Othersome have a frentike zeal, insomuch that they
would feign have the name of God clean wyped out, and the doctrine of the
Gospel utterly quenched. When men see this: o (say they) I will not meddle
with it. What? Shall I bring all the world in my top? Is it not manifest
that they which have tasted this doctrine are but a handful of men, and that
all others are enemies too them, or else they do reject them or laugh them to
scorn, or at leastwyse bear a poisoned and malicious heart against them? Ye
see then, that very few are so strong, as too bear out the stumblingblockes
of the Gospel, when they see as it were logges cast in their way, and that
Jesus Christ is hyndered by Satan, and by the practices of his underlings. O
(say they) we must needs back again. Yea and what a number are too be
seen at this day, which will say that this doctrine brings store of
stumblingblockes? Again, see I pray you what diversity of opinions it has
(say they.) Behold such a one speaks thus, and such a one thus. Furthermore
when the wicked sort which set their tongues to sale like harlots in a
Brothelhouse, and cast out blasphemies against God and his word, find any
cloak either too despize or too reject the Gospel: by and by many wretched
folk have their tongues fyled to say, Alas, we see that this doctrine brings
great stumblingblockes with it. Yea and Jesus Christ should not be that
which the holy Scripture reports him too be, if the Gospel caused not many
stumblings. But yet must we not be dismayed at them: we must rather
overcome them. Thus ye see what we have too gather upon this streyne, where
Saint Paul says that we shall never hold out in the faith of the Gospel,
except we be armed with such constancio, as not to turn out of the way, let
Satan do what he can. Verily (as I said before) we must (as much as we can)
eschew all stumblingblocks, and go on forward, and put the^ ^side. We have
seen heretofore how every of us ought to behave himself, insomuch that the
Prophet Esaias speaking of the preaching of the Gospel, Esaias. 40. 3. 4.
says that the way must be made level, and that the thing which was rough
and crooked before, must now be made smooth and streyt. Well then, we must do
what we can that it may be so. Howbeeit forasmuch as God will have us to be
humbled, and that there must needs be stumblingblocks and comberances, and it
cannot be but that Jesus Christ must reign in the mids of his enemies: let us
go forward and defy all Satan's practizes, and not mislike of the Gospel for
it, though we see never so many stumblings and stumblingblockes abroad in the
world. Now S. Paul having said so, adds, I would to God that al they which
trouble you were cut off. It may seem at the first blush, that S. Paul is
moved here with to much choler, when he wishes that all those which sow their
darnell and errors abroad to pervert Gods pure doctrine should be
dispatched, that the devil might possess the^, and that they might never find
mercy at Gods hand. For so does the word Cut off betoken. But we must mark,
that the zele which we ought to have of Gods glory, forgets all worldly
respects, when they be put into the balance together. Howbeeit before we go any
further, let us first note that in this word Cut off, S. Paul has spoken by a
similitude. For those rascals that had corrupted and falsified the doctrine of
the Gospel, strove for Circumcizion. Well then (says he) pare off and cut
off as much as ye list, and yet all your seeking is but to have other me^
busied about such pelting trifles as well as your selves. But as for me, I would
that all such deceyuers were quite and clean cut off, and that God would sink
them or root the^ out, and so cast the^ off and damn the^, as they might not
have any hope of salvation. Now let us come to that which I have touched. I
told you shortly, that when men make war against God, we must become such
deadly enemies unto them, as we must utterly put out of mind all kindred and
friendship, and all that else is: for otherwise we do not our duty in any wise
unto our God, who, seeing he bears the name of our father, and does us the
honor to take us for his children, ought at the least to have his glory
esteemed of us above all things. But we must pass on yet further. For what
is the Majesty of God? Again, how precious ought (...) truth too be unto
us?

Moreover, seeing that he does so join his glory with our welfare, as we
cannot procure the one without the other: yea and that we can neither profit
him nor disprofite him, though we were never so zealous to mainteyne his
quarrel, for he has no need of us, neither needs he to borow our helping
hand, but yet he makes us his deputies or agents, too none other end but that
every of us should seek his own profit, howbeeit not of this world, nor
in these corruptible things, but in the everlasting salvation of our souls:
seeing (I say) that God imployeth us after such sort, and we notwithstanding
be still retchlesse and cold: is this treachery of ours excusable? Nay we
must come to that which is said in the Psalm, Psalm. 69. b. 10.
The zeal of thine house has eaten me up, and the raylings of them that
rayled on thee, I have taken to my self. Certes, this was fully accomplished
in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ, as in the head of the Church. And
Saint Paul shows that we must be fashioned like unto him as our pattern,
so that whenever we see Gods honor defaced by men, every of us must set
himself manfully against it. Thus ye see breefly that the rule which we must
gather here, is that we must prefer Gods honor before all things, yea even
before a whole million of lives if we had them. Then is it not for us to spare
men, when they streyne themselves to the uttermost of their power to trample
Gods name under foot, to turmoyl the doctrine of salvation, to bring to pass
that we might no more know what religion to stick unto, and to drive away
all peace utterly out of the Church. Therefore if we see men apply their
indeuers that way, is it not reason that we should be their adversaries? To.
12. d. 18
Truly if it be possible, we must procure freendship and agreement with all
men, yea on our own behalf, and so far forth as lies in us, says Saint
Paul to the Romans. But when we see these naughtipackes advance themselves
against God, and thrust forth their horns too dosse at him: it is good reason
that every of us should step forward, and show in deed that we be no more
our own men, but that for as much as our Lord Jesus Christ has bought and
paid for us so dearly, he ought of right to be Lord both of our life, and
of our death. Ye see then why Saint Paul makes here so sharp a wish,
na^^ly that they which had troubled the Galathians might be utterly alienated
from God, and drowned in the gulf of damnation. Now if it be objected that
this wish is against the rule of charity: the answer is easy enough. For we
be bound to love our enemies, yea though they persecute and vex us: and
although they seek nothing but our destruction, yet must we procure their
welfare and salvation to the uttermost of our power, and we must have pity and
compassion of them to see the^ so given over unto Satan. Thus ye see what
charity imports. But yet for all this, God must be above all, as I have
declared already. Therefore Charity is between man and man. When any man
shall have done me wrong, I must forget it. Though he bear me malice, yet must
I procure his welfare. But when it comes to the maynteyning of Gods quarrel,
there me^ must be esteemed less than nothing as I have said already. Yet
notwithstanding we do clean contrary. For what else is the common practice,
than to stoop and stryke sail when God is misdeltwith? And yet in the mean
while every man will follow his own right to the uttermost. As for example:
There is a man that has committed a very heinous crime, he deserves to be
punished: and if he be not corrected there is an evil gap opened to bring in
corruption. There is some man of authority, and (to go no further) they that
ought to show the way of salvation, they that preach the word of God, even
they I say are seen to live wickedly, they be ribauds and lewd folk that
serve to no purpose but to make confusion and debate. And yet for all this,
they must not be cut off, they must not be handled roughly will some say. A
drunkard, a whoremonger, a varlet shall be maynteyned. To be short, there shall
be nothing but contempt of God, and the Gospel shall be unregarded every
where, and yet must all of it be suffered under color that there must some
cleme^cie be used: yea mary, and in the mean while Gods honor must be left
at randon. But if ye do never so little touch these men that are so gentle,
or at leastwise pretend to be so: by and by they fall out into deadly
defiance, saying: why not? such a man has done me such a wrong. They
fight it out to the uttermost. Well then, they endure all things that can be
at the har^ of Satan's underlings, 2. Cor 11. c. 20.
yea even too be buffeted and boxed about the ears by them with shame enough,
as Saint Paul says in the second to the Corinthians: and yet in the mean
while they can not abide that God should be avenged of the dishonor that is
done unto him. Now then we see that S. Paul's zele was well ruled, and if
any man had done him wrong in his own person, we know he would have been
pacient in that behalf. But now that he sees Gods Gospel coming to such an
afterdeele: he can not abide that: but sets him self against it, wishing
that such men were damned. Yea verily: for he had no regard of him self, but
(as I said before) preferred Gods honor before all the whole world. Thus ye
see how we may be safe from straying: namely if we look simply unto God, and
give not heed to our own affections, but be governed by the spirit of
uprightness and discretion, so as God make us too discern how far forth
we must fight, and how far forth we must resist. Then if we once have such
discretion, and be governed by the holy Ghost, Gal. 1 b. 8.
we may with S. Paul, with David, and with the residue of the holy Prophets
defy men, when they go about to turn us away from the pureness of the known
doctrine: yea and we might curse the very Angels if need were, according as
Saint Paul has said heretofore, where he defied the Angels of heaven, if
they should set them selves against the doctrine of the Gospel that he had
preached. Not that the Angels do ever set them selves against it: but that if
it were possible for them to do so. As if he should say, put the case that an
Angel should go about to overthrow your faith: yet should ye rather send him
to hell, and hold him for a feende, and curse him, than be turned aside from
the right way by him. Ye see then that we must in all respects rest wholly
upon God: and moreover let us be afraid of that saying, as though we heard it
thunder from heaven against all such as trouble the Church. For though it
be but Paul that has spoken it, yet did the holy Ghost guide and govern his
tung. For as much then as he was the instrument of God to utter the said
sentence: it is as much as if vnrepealable judgment were already given
against all such as go about to break the union of faith, and the agreement
of brotherhood that ought to be among all Gods children, and to sow errors
and heresies to falsify the pure truth. Furthermore God shows how dearly
he loves us, (as has bin declared this morning) wherein he gives us a
warrant of the fatherly care which he has of our salvation, in that he takes
such vengeance on all such as would disappoynt the same. And finally he
says, Brethren, ye be called too freedom: only make it not an occasion of
fleshlynesse, but serve ye one another in love, because it is the true
fulfilling of the Law, and the very squire also whereby we must rule all our
works. Here Saint Paul shows, first that his striving is not too bring too
pass that men might live at their own ease, and every body sport as they list
themselves: but that we might be free before God. And that is well worth the
marking. For as soon as this word freedom or liberty is spoken of, every of
us is so inclined to his fleshly lusts, that by and by we think with our
selves, very well, then may I do what I list, I am no more restrained, I need
not any more to think my self so much bound, nor to make so great scruple of
conscience as I have done. Thus ye see how that under the pretense of
liberty, every of us makes him self thrall to his own affections. For it is
a policy of the Devils, to deceive and beguyle us in the things that seem to
be good, yea and to turn them to the clean contrary. For (as I have
declared heretofore) it is certain that al such as covet to live after their
own liking, become wretched bondslaues, and are hild in strayter bondage than
such as are set in the stocks or manacles. And why? Let us consider a little
what tyranny there is in our lusts and passions. If a man follow his own
lusts, surely he must needs shake off al shame, and forget himself, and become
a very beast. Lo here the goodly liberty that all men seek commonly by
nature. But I have told you that the liberty whereunto S. Paul exhorts us,
is another manner of thing. It is not that we should run a^ rouers, and have
no bridle to hold us in awe: but that we should consider what God requires
of us, and be ruled by his holy word, and none of us become so lordly as to
say, this or that must be done. For when men take upon them to rule us by laws
and ordinances of their own making, it is certain that they do but (as ye
would say) make infinite cor^^s to strangle poor souls withal. S. Paul
then shows that the liberty which he preached, and for the mayntenance
whereof he stood so stoutly against the deceivers, is not that men should
ouershote themselves and take leave to do what they list, but that they might
freely serve god, and be no more racked and tormented with unquietness, as we
see poor ignorant souls to be, who being hild fast in superstition, are
evermore in doubt and grudge of conscience, making questions of every thing,
and never being resolved of any one point. Of which sort also are the Papists,
who have an infinite number of doubts among them. And no marvel at all: for
they know not too what master they must yield their account. Every of them
talks according to the disposition of his own brain: [one sayes] to my
seeming such a thing would be good: [another sayes] Lo this my devotion tells
me: [and the third says] it were good yet that this or that were done more.
Now when they be once entered into such a maze, at length they fall to doubting
whether they may kembe their heads or no, and make a scrupulousness with
which finger they should feed themselves, and of every thing else. To be
short, there is neither end nor measure of their fondness. Call. 2. d. 21.
When S. Paul intends to show what it is to be wrapped in men's traditions:
he says that when they have once forbidden too eat flesh, anon after they
forbid to taste it: and when they have forbidden to taste it, soon after they
forbid to touch it. Ye see then that the way for us to maynteyne the liberty
that is purchased for us by the death and passion of our lord Jesus Christ, is
first too know in what wise God will be served and honored, to the end we
be not tossed with so many scruples of conscience for want of discerning what
is good or evil, but determine fully and certainly with our selves, to follow
Gods word, assuring our selves also, that in so doing we can not do amiss.
And secondly to serve one another turn, that none of us be so addicted to
his own self as to ouermate his fellows, but be so gentle and kindharted as
every of us have an eye wherein he may advantage or succor his neybour:
absteyning from all offense giving so as it be not said, I care not for such a
one or for such a one, I pass not whether he sink or swim: but that (for as
much as our Lord Jesus Christ has linked us ^^gither too be members of his
Church) we hold fast the said doctrine, that is too wit, first that God
be honored and served among us as he commands, and secondly that we agree
in such wise together, as we labor through meekness to match our selves
one with another, and to serve one another turn, notwithstanding that we be
free still to Godwarde as in respect of our consciences.

And now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God with
acknowledgement of our sins, praying him to make us so too feel them, as it
may humble us before him, and draw us too true repentance, and we go forward
therein more and more, groaning continually under the burden of our sin, till
we be quite cleansed and utterly ridded of it: And that it may please the same
good God to bear with us, and not to handle us so rigorously as he could do,
but to guide us in such wise by his holy spirit, as he may both forgive and
forget our sins, till we be fully cleansed from them. That it may please him
to grant this grace, not only to us, but also to all people and Nations of the
earth. etc.

The. 35. Sermon, which is the fifth upon the fifth Chapter.
14 For all the Law is fulfilled in one word, which is this, Thou shall
love thy neighbor as thy self.

15 If ye bite and devour one another, bevvare that ye be not consumed one of
another.

16 But I say unto you, walk after the spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the
lusts of the flesh.

17 Surely the flesh lusts contrary too the spirit, and the spirit
contrary to the flesh. For these things are one against another, so as ye can
not do all things as ye would.

18 But and if ye be led by the spirit, then are ye not under the Law.


WE see that Moses intending to bring the law into a sum, to the end we
might know what was taught us and told us: says that God will be loved of
us, as good reason it is that we should first stick unto him and be knit unto
him, and afterward that there should be such a bond of friendship among our
selves, as we might be knit together as members of one body. And our Lord
Jesus Christ also says that that is the thing whereby his disciples may be
known: Ioh. 13. d. 35
showing therein that he brought not up any doctrine contrary to that which god
had always given to the people of old time. And for that cause S. Paul says
now, that the fulfilling of the law consists in this word, that we love our
neighbors. Not that God ought in the mean while to be forgotten (as I have
told you heretofore) for it is good reason that he should be set foremost,
and be preferred before all his creatures, in so much that for his sake we
ought to forget even our father and mother, our wife and children, and all that
ever is in this world. Nevertheless, to love God, and to love our neighbors in
their degree, are not things contrary. For when every man walks in charity,
thereby he shows the love that he bears to his God, according also as I
have declared. And that is the cause why I stand no longer upon these points.
To be short, if we be given to our selves, it is a token that we know not
what it is to carry Gods yoke: for that is the thing whereunto our own nature
drives us. Now (as we shall see anon) men are wholly inclined to all evil, and
therwithal they give the bridle to all their lusts, they make war against God,
and al their whole life is nothing else but a rebellion, which shows that the
devil does so possess al our affections that God can not way with us, til we
have beaten down all that is of our own nature. Now then we know that he which
loves his neighbors, seeks not his own, nor is given to himself. That
therefore is a true and certain proof that we be desirous to obey God, and to
rule our life according to his word. Also our Lord Jesus Christ begins at
the same point when he intends to show briefly what his doctrine is: It is
(says he) a learning to renounce or forsake ourselves. For so long as we
follow our own trace, we must needs go full contrary to Gods will. So then it
is not without cause that S. Paul says in this text, that the whole law
consists in this point, that we love our neighbors. But it behooves us to
mark, that by this word neibour, God meeneth not our kinsfolk and friends, at
whose hands we hope for some profit or advantage, or which have deserved some
recompense at our hands: but he will have us to have an eye to the common
aliance which he has set among us. Therefore we be al formed after his image,
and we bear his mark. Besides this, we be al of one nature, and that ought to
hold us in true unity and brotherhod. But many make the^ selves unworthy of
it: for some be full of wiliness and malice like foxes: some are full of pride
like lions: some are like ravening wolves, that seek nothing but to devour al:
and othersome are full of shrewd turns and harmefulnesse [like Apes.] All these
(as much as in the^ is) do cut themselves off from the array and company of
neighbors: but in this case we may observe Gods order. And although men on their
side deserve not to be counted and taken for neighbors: yet notwithstanding in
bearing them love, we show it is good reason that God should ouerwey our own
naughtiness. We see then that such as are our enemies and labor to devour
us, do notwithstanding not cease to be our neibors, in respect of the order
that God has set And for the same cause also our Lord Jesus Christ tells us,
Matthew. 5. g. 46.
that it is no charity to recompense him that has done us a good turn or
service, nor to love those whom we like off, or at whose hands we look for
some profit. For the heathen do as much as that comes too, but they do it not
to obey God and his law, and when we have regard of our own profit, it is
rather a loving of our selves tha^ any point of charity. For the marks that
chatitie shoots at are God and the communion or fellowship that ought to be
among us, as I have said before. Now then we see it is a true proof that we be
desirous to love God, when we indeuer to do good even too them that are
unworthy of it. Moreover the adding of this saying, as our selves, is not to
the intent that every man should first love him self, and then afterward love
his neybour next. But our Lord meant too rippe up the sore th^^ hinders us
too live in charity: which is (as I have told you already) that if men were
not so given to selfeloue as they be, there would be good love and agreement
among all men: but forasmuch as we be so much given to love ourselves, and the
excess of that affection blinds us in such wise, that it bereeueth us of all
reason, equity, and uprightness: therefore God says that we must love our
neighbors as ourselves. For were not that said expressly: we would talk much
of loving our neighbors, and say they ought to be loved: but all would be but
dissimulation, after the manner of these hypocrites, which protest that they
would their enemies no harm, but rather that they wish them good, and could
find in their hearts to procure the^ good. But let us come to the trial that
God sets down here, and let every man look into himself, and then let him
judge whether he love him self to much or no, or whether the love that he
bears toward his neybours, be not ouerfaynt and cold. To be short, here God
meant to remedy the hypocrisy wherewith we be too much blinded. Also he meant to
waken men, that they might learn to leave their flattering of themselves when
it is said, it is not enough for you to love one an other, but ye must love
your neighbors as your selves. And thereby we see how far we be wide from the
perfection of the Law, and that it stands us in hand to fight against our
own nature that we may obey God. What is then the true exercise of
Christians? It is to acknowledge and bewail their own sinfulness and
infirmity in discharging their duty toward God, and thereupon to labor and
indeuer to win of them selves from day to day, so as their lusts may not
ouermaster them, but rather that God may have such superiority, that in stead
of loving our selves, we may labor to employ our selves in doing good
whersoeuer he calls us. Furthermore S. Paul having showed the perfection of
the law, and the mark that we must ame at to rule our life according to Gods
word, adds that if men do bite and snatche one at another like Dogs and
Cattes, they must needs be consumed in the end. And this is too shame them
the more, which are so fleshed in their quarellings and brawlings, and do so
close their eyes against all reason, that they care not what come of it so they
may satisfy their lust of revenging. And what shall ye ^^^ne by it says
Saint Paul? Naturally ye covet too preserve your selves: for that is common
too us even with the beasts. Ye see that the beast which has another reason
nor understanding, does notwithstanding labor to preserve himself, and
shunneth harm. Much more reason is it that men which discern between good
and bad, should have the same indeuer of mainteyning themselves, and of
continuing safe and sound. But now let us see what follows upon hatred,
quareling, brawling, strife, railing, and such other like things. It follows
that we must be all consumed in the end. Needs then must the devil have
utterly bereft them of all reason, which rage and rushe forth after that
fashion in their excessyue hatred, and cannot by any means be moderated. Too
be short, S. Paul shows that although there were no Law of God too make us
afraid too offend him: yet if we were well advised or had any drop of
discretion in us: we should have some stay of ourselves, so as we should not
quarrel and brawle one with another as we do. But we run wilfully and as
it were of set purpose into our destruction: and that is against nature. Ye
see then how devilish men become when they be once chafed, insomuch that they
seek their own decay. And why do we hate our enemies? It is because we will
needs give bridle to our affections. But mark our excuce: O (say we) they
meant me harm, they procured it, and they have done it. Very wel-what for
that? What shall thou win by making two devils of one (as the proverb says)?
or by seeking too make the fire too burn hotter which is kindled enough and to
much already? It will but dubble his rage and make him feercer than he was
before. Seeing it is so: why will thou go about to end the matter with the
destruction of you both? Howbeit, if we should do it in none other respect
than that, it were not enough: for therein we should be too fleshly. For if I
abstain from all hatred, because I should receive harm by it, I do still
seek mine own profit. But God will have us to shet our eyes continually in
respect of our owneselues, and to shake of all ill will, and to tread all
strife under foot. And why? To the end that he himself may have all
maysterhod over us. And although men give us cause too hate them for their
naughtiness: yet notwithstanding forasmuch a God has knit us together, let us
abide in that unity. Therefore the honor that we must yield unto God, is to
renounce ourselves, to the end we may love them that hate us. And as I have
told you already, this warning is not superfluous. For Saint Paul's intent
is too shame such as are so fiery at the first dashe, that reason can neither
appease them nor stay them. Therefore when men be so hot, and fling themselves
at al adventure: things must be alleged agreeable to their nature, to make
them ashamed, that they may be drawn too the obedience of God. S. Paul then
meant here to bring us by little and little to the ouercomming of all our
affections, which are to far out of square, too the end that whenever we
be provoked to hate any man, or to be revenged of him, we may consider thus
with our selves: what will be the end of it, but that we shall one of us
consume another like dogs and cattes? And when we have considered that, we
must proceed yet further: which is, that although our hatred might aduau^tage
us never so much, although we might always have the upper hand of our enemies,
and although we could bring all our practizes and attempts to effect: I say
although we might have advantage by gyuing head to our passions: yet were it
but a provoking of Gods wrath, seeing we could not yield so far unto him, as
to love those that are unworthy. Since the case stands so, let us be afraid
and submit ourselves with all humility. And forasmuch as it is a hard thing,
let us fight so much the more manfully, till God have gotten the maysterie, and
we renounced our selves as I said, forsaking all our own nature, too the
end that we may keep the sacred unity which he did set among us, when it
pleased him that we should be one flesh. Now hereupon Saint Paul adds,
that if we mind to restreine the lusts of our flesh from reigning in us: we
must walk in the spirit. Furthermore the battle is right hard: so that we
do not what we would do: but although God have reformed us and touched us to
the quick, so as we would feign please him in all points: yet notwithstanding
we shall not yet atteyne too perfection, because our own nature will always
lead us unto evil. But before we go any further, we must mark that by the
word Flesh, Saint Paul means all that is in man, and (...) what ever we
bring with us by our birth. According also as our Lord Jesus Christ declares
sufficiently in the third of John. John. 3. a. 6
That which is borne of flesh (says he) is flesh. By the word Spirit he
means not the Soul of man, but the grace which God gives us when he
brings us back to his obedience, and corrects our vices and all that is
contrary to his word. And the terming of men by the name of Flesh in the holy
scripture. is in way of contempt. But yet in this text it is a mark of vice
and corruption. Sometimes when the Scripture speaks of flesh, it says:
Psalm. 78. d. 39.
very well, what else are men but flesh? that is too say, but rottenness?
Ageine, all flesh is grass. And ageine, what are the Egyptians? Esai. 40. b.
6.
They be flesh and not spirit. Ye see then that under this word flesh, men
are taught their own frayltie, and done to understand that they be but earth
and dust, Esai. 31. a. 3
worms, and woormes meat. And this serves first of all to humble them. But
when flesh is matched against Spirit, then are not men taken in their first
state as they were created of God: but it serves too show that they be
corrupted and full of infection and wickedness, so as there is no taste at all
in them to discern aright, but they are utterly perverted in all their lusts.
Ye see then that whereas our Lord Jesus Christ says we be flesh even from
our birth: his meaning is that we be blind wretches, which have no wit at all
too come unto God: and that although he have put an understanding in us to
discern good and evil: yet notwithstanding we be grown brutish, and cannot
come to him, and all the reason that we have, serves but to make us
inexcusable: and finally that we covet nothing but utter evil, and that look
how many affections we have, so many are the enemies that fight against all
ryghtuousnesse. Lo how the holy Ghost blazeth our arms, whereas most men
brag of their own free will and of their virtues: it is said that there is
nothing in us but stark corruption, and that the same is as an enmity against
God, and separateth us from his righteousness. True it is, that our Soul or
mind is oftentimes called by the name of Spirit: for the word Spirit or
Ghost betokens an invisible substance, which cannot be seen nor felt as can
a body. The Angels are Spirits, and so are the Devils also. Howbeit these
are corrupted spirits and alienated from God, so as there is nothing but utter
wickedness i^ ^^em. So then our souls also are Spirits, but yet they be
spirits infected with sin, which thing happened too them when we were changed
and abaced and Gods image defaced in us by the fall of Adam. Now then there had
need to be some renewment thereof: and that renewment is called spirit, which is
when God reformeth us and makes us new creatures by his holy spirit. The first
point whereof is, that we be enlightened so as we conceive the things that were
hidden from us by nature: for faith is the special gift of God, because it is
impossible for man to conceive the things that are for his soul health,
unless God have wrought in him. Ye see then that faith is a gift of the
spirit (as we shall see hereafter in due time and place) insomuch that as we
have not one good motion to come unto God, and to frame ourselves to his will,
except he govern us: so also forasmuch as he has adopted us, he gives us his
holy spirit, which is the true mark that shows us to be Gods children. Too
be short, look whatsoever God puts intoo his chosen and faithful ones too
correct their wicked and sinful nature: the same is comprehended under the
word Spirit. Now S. Paul says that we must walk after the spirit, and then
we shall not fulfill the lusts of our flesh. Hereby he gives warning too
such as delight too much in their own vices and take leave to do naughtily
under pretense that they be not able too withstand it. Here he wakeneth them
up, and tells them that they be without excuse: and that although they be
given unto naughtiness, yet they ought too seek the remedy of it. And what
is that? Truly we shall not find it in ourselves, but God will supply in
that behalf, by giving us grace to fight in such wise against all our lusts
and wicked affections, as his holy spirit shall reign in us, and get the
upper hand of them. God will not deceive us in making us such promise: and
therefore let us hye us to him as diseased folk to a Physician. To be short,
S. Paul has an eye to the excuse that men would bring, and are wont too bring
in this case. O (say they) we be fleshly, and charity is an Angelical
perfection: and how then can we keep it, seeing we be given to all evil, and
our own sinfulness caryeth us away? If sin reigned not in us, then it might
be said that we ought to be united unto God: but our frayltie is to great.
Thus ye see what excuce many folk allege, thinking to be quit by it. But S.
Paul says: It is true that there is nothing but a gulf of all naughtiness
in us, and that as long as men slumber after that fashion in their own
affections, they must needs serve the devil, and become every day more
beasts than other: but seek the remedy. God calls you to him by his
Gospel, he offers you his holy spirit. So then, condemn the evil, that ye
may be sorry for it, and God will so work in you as he will get the upper hand
of all your affections. Ye see then what S. Paul meant in this text.
Nevertheless therwithall he meant too give an overthwart blow to those against
whom he disputes. For I have told you heretofore, that the deceyuers which
had troubled the Church of that Country, were given to many pelting tryfles
which were utterly needelesse, in so much as they grounded all holiness upon
the Ceremonies of the Law. Now, it is true that Gods inioyning of the
Ceremonies for a time was not in vain: for they were figures till the coming
of our Lord Jesus Christ. But now that he is come, they be unprofitable
things, and things that hinder us from walking as we should do. For the
Ceremonies and shadows were helps to bring the ancient fathers too our Lord
Jesus Christ. But if we should hold them still now adays, they would make us
to turn our back to Jesus Christ: so that it is not without cause that S.
Paul has showed heretofore, that the keeping of such things is no more of any
value: and he will speak yet more of it hereafter. Now then forasmuch as he had
to dispute against such as did set forth the Ceremonies, he says unto them,
walk after the spirit. As if he should say, consider which is the true service
of God: it consists not in Lamps, nor in Incense, nor in Circumcision, nor
in the observing of days, nor in forbearing too eat any certain kind of
meats. These are not the things whereon God will have his to rest: but [he will
have them to rest] upon his spiritual service. Therefore walk ye in the
spirit, and then shall yet not fulfill the lusts of the flesh. Howbeit, as I
have told you before, this is not all. But yet by the way S. Paul does after
an indirect manner glaunce at this, that the deceyuers against whom he strove,
were graueled in those small and light ^^ings, which are but as introductions
of this world, and as traynementes of young children. For as much therefore as
they were utterly entangled in the^: he tells the Galathians that they must
walk in the spirit. Furthermore (as I have declared already) here he sets
down the true mean too knit us together in love. For it is impossible for us
too come unto God and too forget all enmity, till we have fought manfully
[ageinst our own affections] And the remedy thereof (as I said) is in God.
Therefore we must pray him to increase the grace of his holy spirit more and
more in us, and then we shall find that the flesh, how furious so ever it
be, how great bubbles and boylings so ever it cast up, yea and though it seem
like a wyld beast that cannot be tamed: I say we shall find that it shall not
be stronger than Gods spirit, and the grace that shall be given us from above,
which shall be able too bring us back, and too hold us under the yoke and
obedience of our God. Too be short S. Paul declares, that the cause why we
cannot resist our leaud lusts, proceeds of our own negligence and coldness,
because every of us fodeth himself in his naughtiness by vain selfsoothing,
and we go not too God with such affection and zeal as were requisite. Then
let us conclude that there is no excuse for men when they sin. For they
delight in it, and would feign that God should let them welter in it, and (as
much as they can) they flee the remedy and amendment of it, yea and they be
so sotted in it, as they pass not too provoke Gods wrath, because they cannot
in any wise abide too be taught. It is true that sometimes they will well
enough protest with their mouth, that they would very feign have their nature:
and inclination changed: but yet would they still covenant with God, that he
should let them alone as they be, without altering of any thing, after the
fashyon of a sick man, who if his disease do press him, will say, o I
would feign be healed: but yet for all that, when he comes too receiving of
counsel at the Physicians hand, and that he should be appointed a diet: he
will not yield to that. The Physician gives him good Counsel, and has helps
ready to heal his disease: but yet notwithstanding, the patient excuses
himself, saying, O Sir, my heart will not serve me too do it. If a sick man
will needs drink, and in stead (...) heat take cold, and be so unruly as
he cannot be brydled, but refuses all that is ministered too him for his
health, and plays the mad bedlem: he may well protest that he would feign be
cured, but the flat contrary appears. Even so is it with them that resort
unto God too pray him too govern them in such wise by his holy spirit, as
they may be changed and forget all their lusts, and put them under foot:
and yet in the mean while will needs continue and welter in them still. Thus
ye see in effect what we have to bear in mind. Nevertheless it is certain
that although we pray to God earnestly, and every of us streine himself to
subdue his wicked affections: yet we shall not cease too have infirmities
still howsoever the world go. I speak not of the hypocrites, I speak of the
true children of God. For they that have profited most in all perfection, go
still as it were limping unto Godward, neither do they what they would as S.
Paul will add anon after, and as he shows more at large in the vij. to the
Romans. Nevertheless as soon as the faithful feel their disease, they seek
the remedy of it in God, yea and they seek it earnestly and unfeignedly, and
perceive that his succor surmou^teth all their own leaud affections. According
hereunto S. Paul says, ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh. He
says not, that of all our life long Satan shall not tempt us to do any evil,
nor that we shall not have store of prouocatio^s, for our flesh shall always
have his stings to stir us up unto naughtiness. Therefore we shall be tempted
to all vices: but yet shall we withstand the^ by Gods grace. And not without
cause is this added: for if we were not warranted that God accepts our
service though it be faulty and we weak, and though we run not with such
courage as were requisite: every of us should be as it were beaten down, and in
the end we should fall into despair as it happens to diverse, who upon the
examining of their own lives, finding themselves so imperfect and still far
off from God, think themselves not to have profited at all, and thereupon fall
to chasing and fretting, and finally become stark mad. Truly we ought to go
foreward to the said perfection, and to labor continually for it: but yet
howsoever we fare, let us not cease to seek God though we cannot come at him
by reason of the great number of lettes and impediments, and though we now and
(...) make false steps, and our wicked lusts hold us back, hinder us, and
lie sore upon us (as I said:) let us not forsake our way for all that, though
we be shaken now and then. Although then that by nature we cannot keep our
way lustily to come unto our God: yet is it enough that we fulfill not the
lusts of our flesh: for although we feel them, and although they be ouerstrong
in us: yet if we overcome them God accepts it, and forgiueth us all the whole
default. According whereunto S. Paul exhorting the faithful not to cast down
their hearts out of measure: says that the flesh reigns not in us. He says
not that wicked lusts and sinful affections dwell not any more in us: for we
shall never be rid of them till it please God too take us too himself? Then
till such time as we be out of this world, there shall always be blemishes
and spots in us, and we must be feign too stoop under the fardell of our
sins and infirmities, and that is too the intent to humble us the more, and
to show that our life is a continual battle. Moreover although sin dwell in
us, yet must it not reign, but Gods spirit must get the upper hand of it, and
that shall be done when we flee unto God with an earnest zeal, praying him to
remedy the evil which passes our power to amend, and in such wise too
increase the gifts of his spirit in us, as we may overcome all things that do
as it were hold us down. Thus ye see what S. Paul meant by that saying in this
text. And he adds thereunto, that the spirit lusts against the flesh, and
the flesh against the spirit, so as we do not the thing that we feign would
do. Here his meaning is to quicken us up to keep good watch, yea and too have
our harness always upon our backs as they say, and too be in a readiness
against the enemy. If we were clear from all vices, and that all men without
gaynsaying did follow the thing that God commands by his word: we should
not need too streine ourselves much, no more than the Angels of heaven, who
need not to fight, for they be ready to do all that is commanded them.
Forasmuch then as there is no rebelliousnesse in the Angels: therefore also they
have no striving when they should give themselves to the service of God: for
they be wholly bent and inclined thereunto. But S. Paul lets us that we
must not be slothful in serving of God. And why? for our nature draggeth
always ^^^ke, and we should never love goodness, except we were enforced
and compelled to it. Therefore men must enforce and constreyne themselves, and
mainteyne battle as against a deadly enemy, when they intend to go forward
in goodness. And who be our enemies? Truly the devil is the chief, and he
gives us terrible assaults. But yet therwithall, all our own thoughts, all
our own affections, all our desires, are all deadly enemies that labor to
bring us to destruction. Now if they fight against God, it is certain that
they be also against our salvation. We see then how S. Paul's meaning here,
is as though he had cried out alaru^, to show that if Christians be either
slepish or slothful, and think to serve God at their own ease: they beguile
themselves, and that forasmuch as they have battle upon battle to endure
without end or ceassing, and Satan tempts the^ day and night, walking about
one while with wiles and treason, and another while setting upon them by open
force to drive the^ out of the way: they must arm themselves thoroughly, and
enter into the encounter, and hold it out to the end, and not look to have any
peace or truce, til God take them out of the world. Ye see in effect what S.
Paul's doctrine imports. And this exhortation is more than necessary for us,
because most men think it enough, if they have but some little devotion or
willingness to serve God: and although they welter in much filthiness, al is
one to the^: and othersome repine when they see how hard a thing it is to rule
their life well. And how is that possible? God seems to press us out of
measure, for he seeks not what may please us, but rather condemns it. But
how shall we bring to pass that we may put our selves to it? For our
inclination goes clean contrary to his will. It seems then that he mocketh
us when he preasseth so upon us: and why does he not give us another manner of
nature than that? Lo how diverse men blaspheme God, in having an eye to their
own sinfulness. Howbeit to the end that none of us fall asleep, ne think
himself to have performed all that God commands, when we shall have followed
some path half way, nor be utterly thrust out of the way altogether: S. Paul
says that the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the
flesh. In saying that the flesh lusts, he does us to wit, that we shall never
be able to serve God without disquieting, because we shall have many lets, and
be continually tempted unto evil. Yea and when we be^ ^eterminately bent to
submit our selves wholly unto Gods word and righteousness: yet nevertheless
the devil shall even then have his ropes to draw us one way or other. Again,
he will in such wise amaze us, as our fleshly desires shall still be a
hinderance to us, and not only that: but also make us too draw back the clean
contrary way, so that when God calls us on the one side, we shall be
carried with a rage too the other side. Now seeing that the flesh lusts after
that manner against the spirit: let us determine to fight manfully, and let it
not grieve us so to do. Although we ought to wish to be as Angels, so as
there might be no striving in us, but that al our ability might be employed
too the service of God, yet notwithstanding, whenever we be let to do
well, let us learn to streyne our selves, and to hold our selves as
prisoners: and although the same fall out greatly to our coffeehouse, yet
nevertheless let us go on still further, that God may win the upper hand of
us. Let us learn too hate our selves, to take displeasure against our selves,
and to be revenged of our own naughtiness, 2. Co. 7. c. 11
as Saint Paul says in the second too the Corinthians. For Repentance
imports that men should condemn themselves, hate themselves, and take
vengeance on themselves, when they see their whole life corrupted, and that
they should use an holy anger against it. In sted of desiring to be revenged of
our enemies when they have done us any harm, we should be chafed and angry
with our selves, yea and punish our selves for faults, when we cannot frame our
selves unto Gods will. But forasmuch as we might become desperate, and every
man reply, Al^s, how should we fight after that fashion? Where is our
strength? For there is nothing but weakness in us, and again we see that the
devil is so mighty and strong an enemy, as we can never be able to subdue
him, and our lusts are as mad beasts, without reason, without measure, without
stay: by reason whereof we be as good as vanquished, even before any stroke be
stricken: S. Paul says that the spirit does also lust against the flesh: that
is to say, tht whereas we be provoked to do evil of our own nature, and the
devil thrusts us forward, it stands us on hand to fight so much the more
valiantly against all the temptations wherewith we be pri^^^d and spurred. And
in so doing we have a good help. For who ^all gain the goal? Who shall have
the upper hand and maystrie? Shall the corruption that is in us? or shall the
power of God have it? Therefore whenever God lists to utter the grace of
his holy spirit, he shall always be the stronger and win the field, how
great hardness soever there be in the matter. So then let us do so much
honor unto God, as to trust that he will uphold us, and make us to win the
battle, and let us march on boldly under his banner, howbeit in calling upon
him with reverence and warenesse. For (as I have showed already) S. Paul meant
not to make it too hard a matter, because men are overmuch inclyned to
slothfulness. He meant not to rock men asleep: no, but he tells us, first
that we must become enemies to our selves, and fight against our own
thoughts, and against all our affections, to serve God aright. But now,
because we might be astonished, and every of us might draw back because it
is impossible for us too bring it about: he says, Shall not Gods spirit
get the upper hand? Yes, but we have it not. And of whom is that long, but
for that we resort not too him that is ready too give it us, Esa. 55. a. 1.
yea verily in such measure and portion as he knows too be for our behoof?
Our Lord cries by the Prophet Esaias* All you that be athirst, come to the
water, take both wine, water, and milk, without money or ware: for I am ready
too give you bountifully as much as you need. Lo how God speaks. Likewise
our Lord Jesus Christ also tells us, that he is the true fountain whereout
of it behooves us to draw, John. 7. f. 37.
and that we shall be satisfied with his fullness, according as he says in
the.vij. of S. John, that whosoever comes to him, shall drink his fill of
water, yea and have such a well in himself, as Rivers shall gushe out of it,
so as he shall not only have enough to serve his own turn, but also the
waters shall flow out of his belly, if he suffer Jesus Christ to pour out
his spirit upon him, for he is pressed and ready to do it. So then although
Gods spirit be a great way off from us: yet shall we receive enough of it,
and God is ready to give it us, and he will do it because he has promised
it, and forasmuch as he allureth us so gently, we shall receive as much as
shall sted our turn. Therefore like as we be warned here too fight, yea
even with might and main: so on the other side (...) showed us that our
victory is most certain and infallible, so we seek succor at Gods hand,
acknowledging our own weakness, and confessing humbly that we can do nothing.
If we repair to our God, and desire him to be our Physician: his holy
spirit shall not be so weak, but he shall overcome all the passions of our
flesh, and give us the grace too go through with all the battles that shall
be set against us. And now again Saint Paul says, that the faithful do
not what they would: and that is to give them courage still, that we may
learn to go on forward, though we can not bring all the things to pass
thoroughly and perfectly which God shows unto us* And this is needful as I
said: for else we should be hypocrites, and bear our selves in hand that
nothing were amiss. But such pride were intolerable: of which sort we see
some mastife dogs, in whom there is neither fear of God nor Religion, and
yet they preach that the faithful ought to be perfect. And that is a devilish
blasphemy, and such a one as we ought too abhor. There are others that
despair when they see that they cannot discharge their duty toward God. To
the end therefore that we may neither be hypocrites nor yet faint, S. Paul
says that we do not all that we would. But howsoever we fare, we must come
back to that which he touched not long since: namely that we fulfill not the
lusts of the flesh when we be governed by the holy Ghost. So then, first let
us understand, that we be so given unto evil, that a man cannot wring out
one drop of goodness out of our thoughts and affections, but they alienate us
quite and clean from it. Mark that for one point. Secondly let us trust in
God, that notwithstanding our vices, yea, and rebellions, he will make us to
walk in his obedience. For we shall be governed by his holy spirit, who will
make us too feel such a working in us, as we shall not be hilde back nor
hindered too go forward in our good race, but keep on still to the mark that
we ame at. Thirdly, if we see yet some resistance in our selves, and that we
had need too be enforced more and more, because that many overthwart things
do let us, insomuch that we do even fall, or else happen too run astray:
let us not be discouraged for all that, but let us follow the holy calling of
God, and still learn effectually to cut o^ our vices.

And to bring that to pass, let us be sorry for them, and confess them
willingly before God. But howsoever we fare, let us not think our selves
forsaken of him, though our life be never so imperfect. Thus ye see that the
thing which we have to bear in mind, is that all the imperfections and
infirmities that we feel as yet in our selves, shall not restreyn our
indeuering to submit our selves to our God, and to frame our selves more and
more in his fear, and yet notwithstanding that in the mean while we shall not
have any towel of flattery before our eyes to blind our selves withal, but we
shall be heartily sorry, confessing our selves to be excedingly indetted unto him
and yet nevertheless aspiring still to the perfection whereunto we must go
onward all the time of our life, and therwithal acknowledging that we are all
forlorn and damned, unless that he of his infinite goodness do bear with us
for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake.

But now let us fall down before the Majesty of our good God with
acknoledgement of our faults, praying him to make us feel them more and more,
so as we may not only confess them with our mouth, but also be touched with
such true repentance and pure zeal, as we may indeuer to give our selves
wholly unto him, and to cut off all the superfluities that are in us, and as
the same may cause us to frame our selves to his holy will, and to serve him in
such union and concord, that we may be given to magnify him with one heart, and
with one mouth, thereby showing that we be rightly knit unto him in the
adoption which he shows us by his Gospel, whereby he shows himself to be
our father, as feign as we would be his true children. And therefore let us al
say, Almighty God our heavenly. etc.

The.xxxvj. Sermon, which is the sixth upon the fifth Chapter.
19 The works of the flesh are manifest, which are these, Aduoutrie,
whoredom, uncleanness, loocenesse:

20 Idolatry, poisoning enmity, strife, spiting, wrath, quarelling, sedition
^^ectes.

21 Envy, murder, drunkenness, gluttony, and such like: of which I tell
you aforehande, as I have told you heretofore, that they which do such
things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

22 But the fruit of the spirit, is love, joy, peace, patientnesse,
gentleness, goodness, faythfulnesse.

23 Meekness, temperance: against such things there is no law.


We have seen this morning, that men are condemned before God, so as there
comes nothing of them but utter filthiness and infection. Now if God be the
rule of all perfection, then of necessity all that is contrary to his nature
and word must needs be stark naught. But it is certain that the flesh is at
continual war against the spirit. Therefore therein it is declared that so long
as me^ follow their own swinge, they be deadly enemies too God all their life
long. Seeing it is so, we must needs conclude, that there is nothing in us but
utter lewdness and sinfulness. Now when we here such sentence given of us,
we ought to be utterly abashed. For it is the definitive sentence of the
heavenly judge, against which there lies no appeal, and again Gods speaking
is with effect. Therefore seeing he has pronounced that we be wicked and
froward by nature, he will immediately do his office. So then we must come to
account before him: but we see that men are so sotted either in their
hypocrisy, or in their selfweening, that they pass not of provoking Gods
wrath against them. For every man flattereth and fodeth himself in his vices,
insomuch that we ca^ never be drawn to a true acknowledgement of our sins,
but by force. And it is evident that our doing of it is with windlasses and
bystarts, and which more is, we become so shameless that we seek fond
shifts and excuses, as though they could help us before God. Therefore it is not
enough for us to here generally the sentence of comdemnation upon us, but God
must be fain to discover our lewdness, that w^^ ^ay be ashamed of it ^ and
moreover to specify and point with his finger; the vices that are apparent and
notorious before me^. And that is the cause why S. Paul having said this
morning that men in all their thoughts and affections do fight against God:
adds this declaration which we have now presently heard, as though he brought
forth the fruits, to the end that men might thereby judge what the tree is,
because the root which is the cheef thing lies hid. The^ like as the tree is
known by his fruits, so also the sinfulness that reigns in us, and in our
nature is found out by the works that come of it. And so we see why S. Paul
adds here, that the works of the flesh are manifest. As if he should say,
men shet their eyes that they may not perceive their own naughtiness, and
bear themselves in hand that there is nothing but virtue in them, when
notwithstanding, their vices are so huge and excessive, as they be ready to
burst with them: when they have pleaded their best, and sought all the starting
holes that ca^ be, when they have wrung their mouth awry, and turkined things
never so much, yet must they in the end come to this point, that our life
cries out loud and shirle what we be. Therefore the works of the flesh are all
manifest. So then this is enough to disprove such as would feign cloak
themselves and use painting, as though they were not guilty before God. Truth
it is that S. Paul does not make here a full beadrol of all the vices that god
condemns in his law: but only sets forth some examples whereby a man may
easily judge of all the rest. For he must have made a long process, if he had
intended to have made such a reckning up of the^: but this was enough, that
such as wene to gain by their hypocrisy might be co^uicted here, as ye see
they be. And for the better understanding hereof, we have to mark breefly,
which is the rule whereby to walk in obedience toward god, Tit. 2. c. 11.
according to the. 2. of Tit. where it is said that gods grace appeered to the
end we should lead a holy conversation here beneath in this world, in modesty
and righteousness waiting for the hope of the life that is promised us, and for
the coming of the great Savior, which must gather us up to himself into the
kingdom of heaven. Ye see the^ that the thing wherein christians must exercise
themselves and whereto they must wholly apply themselves, is first to know that
they have not their everlasting rest and heritage here, but that the world is
but as a strange Country wherethrough they must pass, and therefore that they
must always have their eyes lifted up to heauenwarde. That is the chief
point. But that cannot be done, but the faithful must needs therewithal call
upon God, and resort wholly unto him. And as touching their life Saint Paul
says that it has three things in it: namely, holiness, that we serve God
soundly and substancially with a pure heart, utterly renouncing all the
uncleanness of this world. That is the first point. The second is, that we
must not be wanton and dishonest, but that we must lead an honest life. The
third is, that we wrong no man, nor use any deceyte or cruelty, but that we
indeuer to do our neighbor good. Lo what the life of Christians is. But S.
Paul says here, that if men will not acknowledge themselves to be utter
enemies too God, and full of all naughtiness and rebellion: let them but make
a short inquiry, and look into their life, and they shall find that some of
them be whoremongers, some drunkardes, some given to all ribawdrie, some
murderers, some Sorcerers, some sedicious, some full of ambition, and
othersome desirous to sow abroad darnell and troubles, and to bring up sects
to pervert Gods truth with their corruptions. Thus ye see what is to be found
in men if their lives be well serched. But what shall they win by going to law
with God, and by laboring to cover their lewdness with shifting? nothing at
al. Howbeit they confess not it with their mouth: it is their life that must
speak it: their life together with all their works that are known in it,
bear record of the things that I have said, and so there needs no more
disputing. Furthermore, when as S. Paul says that the works of the flesh are
manifest: he meeneth not that all those whom God suffers to follow their
natural swinge, and whom he governs not by his holy spirit, are atteinted
with all the vices here named: but that there is not any man which is not so
corrupted, that he abandoneth himself sometime to one naughtiness and
sometime to two or three at once, as occasion serves. Ye shall see many
heathen men and unbelievers, in whom there is no fear of God, nor any
knowledge of his word, which have some outward show of virtue and honesty: yet
is it no consequent that they be not corrupted, howbeit that the ^^^ection is
hidden and settled inwardly, and there is an impostun^^ that rotteth all
within. Howsoever the case stand, there is another rule nor measure in man's
nature, but all is out of order and confounded there. You see then that the
thing which we have to gather upon this streyne, is that we must not be
beguyled with our own hypocrisy, but every of us must have an eye too
himself, and examine his own life thoroughly, and then shall we all have
cause to cast down our eyes, and to shet our mouths, and therewith to
acknowledge that we be wretched, and that there is nothing but damnation in
us. Truly although none of the things that S. Paul rehearceth here do
appear in us, so as we be blameless before men, yea and seem too be little
Angels: yet cease we not too be wicked and untoward, till God have reformed
us. Nevertheless God gives every of us sufficient record in our lives,
whereby to cast us quite down, and to make us give over our pleading of our
own accord. Thus ye see in effect, that the mean to put this lesson in ure,
is that if we think our selves to be any thing worth, and perceive not the
wantes that are in us: we must sift our life, and compare our works with the
things that God bids or forbids: and then we shall have a fair
lookingglasse, wherein to behold our lewdness and filthiness: and whereas it
seemed erst that there was nothing but all pureness and perfection in us: God
will show us to our faces, that we be full of wickedness. And yet
nevertheless when we shall have considered this diverse and many times: let
us thereupon conclude, that it is not the hundredth part of it. For we shall
always be dimsighted in finding out of our own wantes. Although God
constreyne and reprove us in such wise as we cannot deny it: yet will he show
in the end, that for every point that we have known, there are a hundred that
were hidden from us. And verily when we see our works laid open before us:
it is to make us go to the welspring of them. Many men are so gross, that if
they have not committed whoredom, if they have not playde the drunkardes
openly, or if their filching and pilfering have bin so covertly and finely
conveyed as noman could bewray them, they think themselves quite and clear.
But S. Paul's intent in saying that the works of the flesh are manifest, is
not to flatter men as though a sin were not to be condemned till it were
openly seen in deed. For (...) told you) we must proceed from the one to
the other. Then if whoredom, drunkenness, robbery, murder, treason,
blasphemy against God, troublesomnesse, and sedition, be detestable things in
themselves: we must also conclude thereupon, that the wickedness which lurketh
within the heart, (as ambition and pride, when men esteem and like of
themselves too much) is detestable likewise. Also couetuousnesse when we have a
mind too other men's goods, and all other like things are to be condemned
likewise. To be short, our outward doings bear witness that we be full of
infection before God. And where is that infectio^ to be found? In our desires,
in our intentes, in our thoughts, and in all our doings, we see there is even
as it were a well spring of all naughtiness. So then, let us be drawn to
such an acknowledgment of our sins, as we may be heartily sorry for them
before God. And we see that in the Law there is such a fashion of teaching.
God in his Law forbids not fornication, but aduoutrie: yea and at the first
sight he forbids not fraud and filching: what forbids he then? Theft or
robbery. He forbids not lying, but only falswitnesse. Now then it should
seem to the^ which know not the power of the law, that they have well
discharged their duty, when they have well eschewed those crimes. Romans 7. b. 6
And that is the cause why S. Paul said that for a time he thought himself to
be thoroughly rightuous, and that God could not have blamed him for any thing.
After the same manner do the hipocrites sotte themselves in their own
selfweening, and thervpo^ become mad if God find fault with the^, because they
think he does the^ great wrong. And why? for they co^ceyue not what the nature
of the Law is. Romans 7. c. 14.
It is spiritual (says S. Paul): that is too say, we must be wholly
reformed to frame our selves thereafter. But so long as we follow our own
fleshly nature, all that we think, and all that we can say or do, shall be no
better than sin before God. So then, we must not look only at the bare
words that are set down in the Law, [but too the things that are meant and
contained in them.] God by setting down the particular kind of Aduoutrie, meant
too make all kind of whoredom hateful: for if marriage continue not whole and
sound without impeachment, it peruerteth all order and civil policy among
men. God therefore under the word Aduoutrie, has showed that all whoredom
and ^chastenesse displeazeth him. Again he says, Thou shall not kill. Is it
then lawful too beat a man? John. 3. c. 15
No, nor yet to hate him: for (as S. John says) he that hates his neybour
secretly is a murderer before God, though he another torment him nor touch him
with his finger: So then, under the word Murder, God condemns all wrong that
we do to our neighbors. Although then that we stir not a finger to do them
harm: yet if we hate them or bear them ill will, we be condemned of murder
before God. In like case is it with Theft. For not only they that are whipped,
hanged, or which have their ears cut off are thieves before God: but also even
all those that bear the countenance of honest men and are in credit and
estimation, are thieves too, if they deceive and beguile their neighbors. What
countenance so ever they carry to the worldward, though men be not able to
accuse them of robbery: yet are they thieves before God. As much is to be
said of all the rest. Likewise in this text, when S. Paul says that the
deeds of the flesh are manifest: he gives us such an instruction, as leads
us from the great to the small. And when we shall have bin convicted of our
wretchedness and vices, and our shamefulnesse is so discovered as we can no
more reply too it: let us then enter into another trial, that is to wit, of
examining all our lusts which tempt us unto evil: and whither it be theft,
cruelty, guyle, perjury, hatred, or enmity, all those things are too be
condemned alike. For the Tree ceasseth not too be evil, though men see not
the fruytes of it at the first dashe: but yet men judge of the nature of the
tree by his fruit, howbeeit that the tree keeps his own nature still. And
this is too be marked well, because that (as I said before) although God drive
men too condemn themselves, yet they do it but by halues, and for all that he
can do too them, they would feign still that their faults which are not seen
too the worldward, should be released them and never be spoken of. As for
example, he that is condemned for dooyng some wicked act, will not excuse
himself of it, for as much as he is enforced too confess it whither he will
or no: But in the mean while, as for any entering intoo himself, to think
upon Gods Justice and his own desert, and to consider that he had many
temptations before he came to the deed doing, and that he offended God a
^^^dred times before his fault came to light: it is no part of his thought. So
much the more therefore does it stand us in hand, too mark well this warning
which I have touched already. And verily here we see the over gross
doltishnesse of the chief teachers of Papistrie, in that they say it is no
sin too think evil or to be tempted, so we consent not too it. A man (say
they) may be tempted to do his neighbor some wrong, he may have some
hartburning and malice against him to be revenged of him that has displeased
him, and if occasion were offered, he might incontinently be sharp set: but
yet none of all this is sin (say they) so there be no full consent and
resolute purpose too do it. They do but wring their mouth awry like harlots,
or snuff up their snoutes like swyne that have wallowed in dirt and filth.
Though a man grudge and chafe against God, yea and doubt whither he have any
care of him or no: and though he be tossed and turmoyled with much distrust so
as he cannot by any means resort too God for refuge: all these things are no
sin among the Papists. And I say not that only the common sort are thus
abused: but it is the resolute doctrine and determination of all their
Universities, that such things ought not to be counted sin. They can well
enough say that before baptism all is sin: but when we be once baptized,
then all is virtue: and although we doubt of God, although we have much
hartburning against him, and although we be tempted with much impaciencie: yet
notwithstanding, be we never so much provoked unto evil doing, or be we never
so much shaken too and fro; all is well. To be short, though we be inclined to
al things that God condemns and disalloweth in his law, and which are not
lawful for us to do: it makes no matter at all. But they be well worthy to
be cast into such blockishnesse. For like as they have set up Idolles and
puppettes to worship: so is it good reason that they should be sotted with
their Gods, and make but a sport and play of righteousness and vncorruptnesse,
as if a man should play with a little child. No marvel then though such manner
of folk be harried away after that fashion: for in as much they have defaced
Gods glory and brought it to nothing: they must needs become stark beasts.
But let us on our side mark what I have alleged already upon the other ^exte
of S. Paul, namely that the Law is spiritual, and therefore that if our
manifest deeds do prove us too be rebels against God: then surely as often as
we be tickled with any wicked lusts inwardly, although the same be not
known of men to make us faulty to the worldward: God will find an infinite
number, yea even a whole sea of them. Therefore let us conclude that we be
utterly drowned in cursednesse to all respects, till God look mercyfully upon
us and draw us out of it. Thus ye see in effect how we must apply this saying
of S. Paul's too our instruction: namely that for so much as we consider not by
the vices that are hidden in us, that God comes to examine our life: therefore
we must learn to humble our selves. And secondly that when we see our sins
to be such as are known and manifest to all men and utterly inexcusable, yea
even before children: we must be led further thereby: that is to wit, we must
search our selves to the bottom, and understand that all our lusts and al our
thoughts are utter rebelliousnesse against God. Now if every man were diligent
in examining himself after this fashion: surely we should all of us have cause
to sigh and groan, all pride and loftiness would be laid down, yea and we
would be ashamed of our whole life. But it is seen that every of us turns
away as much as he can from the considering of his own sins: we cast them
quite and clean behind our backs. Yet notwithstanding God forgets the^
not: howbeit if we would that he should forget them, it would behoue us to
remember them our selves. And that is the thing whereunto S. Paul incourageth
us in this text. Furthermore we see what fondness and ignorance, or rather
beastliness has bin in the Popish doctors, in that they have thought this
word Flesh too be token nothing else in man but fleshlinesse or sensuality as
they term it. For thus do they part it. They be contented to grant that
there is nothing but corruption in all our lusts which they term by the name
of inferior or lower: but in the mean while (say they) we have our will free,
yea even in such sort as there remains some [sound] reason and understanding
in us. Ye see then, that in the opinion of the Papists, man is then sensual,
when he behaueth not himself according too reason, but yields to much either
to whoredom, or to drunkenness, or to gluttony, or to such other like
things. But S. Paul mustereth Ambition or vaynglorie here in the same it ^nke
with them. For whereof comes it that men bear such spite one to another, and
heave one at another to surmount each other, and to be counted wizer or wittier
than other men? Is it not for that every man coueteth to be a jolly fellow to
the worldward? And is that fault less to be condemned than whoredom or
drunkenness? When a poor wretch that desires but to eat and drink, has
well filled his belly, he goes his way as he was wont, he desires to be another
King nor great Lord, he passes away his time. Another that is given to play,
goes to sport him with unthrifts like himself, and is not tempted with
ambition or desire of honor. Those then which seem most honorable, and make
most of their painted sheath, are most fleshly says (S. Paul), according
also as we have seen in the first Epistle too the Corinthians, 1. Cor. 3. a. 3
where he blamed them as fleshly, because they were at variance one against
another about the doctrine, and were so fond and curious to be seen and had in
estimation of men, in respect whereof also he mencioneth sects and heresies.
If a man trouble Gods Church by false doctrine, whither it be in despite of
some men, or to purchase himself reputation and renown: after the opinion of
the Papists it is not to be said that it is fleshly dealing, it is to be said
that it was but too subtle dealing. Yea, but S. Paul says that heresy,
vain glory, and strife or spiting, are works of the flesh. Now then we see
the thing that we treated of this morning: to wit, that under the word Flesh
is comprehended all that is a man's own, and that we must be changed and
fashioned new again, or else we shall be given to all naughtiness. It is true
(as I have touched already) that although God suffer the Paynims and Infidelles
to run upon the bridle, and have not begotten them again by his holy spirit:
yet they may after a sort be counted virtuous, and a man shall find some
honesty in their lives, at leastwise all of them shall not be whoremongers,
drunkardes, or thieves. Ier. 17. b. 9.
How then does S. Paul call them fleshly? Because man's heart (as says the
Prophet Jeremy) is a deep gulf of iniquity, whereof there is another bank
nor bottom to be found, and that does the Prophet well bewray in saying, what a
gulf is the heart of man, and who is able to sound it? None but God (says
he). For we see how men flatter themselves, and are so festred in their
naughtiness, and so hardened in their sins, that ^^ey heap mischief upon
mischief, and sin upon sin, and bear themselves in hand that their vices
are virtues, but yet their life shall have some fair show and gloss upon it.
But yet does it not therefore follow, that such as have not bin taught are
justified. For when as Saint Paul in the first too the Romans says, Romans
1. c. 20.
that all the world is condemned of wickedness and unthankfulness, in as much
as God had so showed himself to all men without exception, as suffizeth too
take away all excuce from them: he adds, that because they honored not God as
they ought to have done when they knew him, therefore he did cast them up into
a lewd mind, and give them over too shameful and outrageous lusts: and
thereupon he reherceth horrible things. Among which, he sets down
whoredom, murder, and other wickedness and uncleanness, such as ought not
to be once named among men. After them, he sets down envy, lewd dealing
in buying and selling, guylefulnesse, perjury, hatred, strife, and debate. Go
too now, all this geere was not known among the unbelievers, and yet
notwithstanding Saint Paul says that all of them from the greatest too the
least, were thankelesse toward God, and had defrauded him of his due honor,
and therefore were all traitors, for they had plucked from him the thing that
was his own, and therefore he paid them their deserved wages, namely because
the seed of all sin is too be found in man's nature. All men then are
fraught with as many vices as can be deuized: but yet does God hold them
short, so as he suffers not men too give over themselves to all
naughtiness. And for proof thereof, many Infidelles which have not natural
reason to govern themselves withal, are notwithstanding chaste and shamefast,
they spoil not otherme^ of their goods, they be sober and honest, and to be
short, they have many virtues after the opinion of the world. And why then are
they condemned as whorehunters, thieves, and drunkardes? It is because they
have not those virtues in obedience unto God, another is there any soundness
in their heart: but they be restrained with fear of shame, or hilde in the
way by some other means unknown too us. But yet doothe God by that means
spare mankind, too the end that ^^^gs should not go too havoc, nor men
become altogether brut^ it ^eastes. God then does so rule the unbelievers, as
that their virtues (howsoever the world go) cease not to be sinful still.
And therefore upon every light occasion they give themselves too all
naughtiness, whenever God gives them the bridle. If it be said that the
faithful also do ouershoote themselves: I grant it: but yet has God promised
to strengthen them, so as they shall hold out too the end. Again there is
great diversity between Gods children that are governed by his spirit, and
the faythlesse that are still fleshely. For the intent and drifte of Gods
children, is to dedicate themselves wholly unto him, that they may be made pure
through his grace: but the other sort walk at rouers, and when they do any
good, they scarsly have the skill too know why they do it. They may well have
the word virtue in their mouths: but yet for all that, their going is not to
godward, but they keep still a loo^e from him. This in effect is the thing
that we have to gather upon this streyne. Now on the otherside S. Paul
says, that the fruits of the spirit are joy, peace, meekness, gentleness,
patientnesse, and such other like. As if he should say, that considering our
great frowardness and that there is nothing in us but corruption and
naughtiness: we have enough wherewith to keep our selves occupied, so as we
shall not need to be idle all our life long, if we do nothing else but fight
against our own vices: we shall find enough there, to buzie our selves with
both day and night. Again on the otherside, since we be commanded to be
meelde and gentle, to live sober and chaste in all respects, to keep our
selves from all defiling, to offer our selves as it were in sacrifize unto God,
to forbear from all harm or anoyance, and in stead of seeking our own
profit too streyne our selves to the uttermost to succor and help such as
have need of us: since we see that all this is commanded us: is it possible
for us too bring it to pass? No: and yet the matter concerns our catching up
into heaven, that we might be near unto God. For the holiness that is
required in the law, and all the good works that God commands us, are as a
knitting of him unto us, and of us unto him. But where are now the wings that
should carry us up so high? For we can be another chaste, nor kindharted, nor
gentle, nor modest, nor sober: unless we (...) and clean plucked from our
own nature, by forsaking bot^^^e world and our selves. But that passes all
our ability. Then is there here wherewith to abashe us. But mark how S. Paul
for conclusion says, that there is no law against such things. That is to
say, if we be once governed by Gods spirit, then shall we no more be subject
too the law. It is true that here he gives courage to all the faithful,
because they shall always feel infirmity in themselves, till they be quite
rid of this mortal body. But howsoever the case stand, seeing that God holds
the^ up, and cesseth not too accept their service though they be not
thoroughly and perfectly reformed: therefore they may be able too hold out,
whereas otherwise they should be combered and fall into despair. S. Paul then
meant too exhort us here unto constancy, saying that if we be governed by
Gods spirit, we be no more subject too the law. But yet therwithall he did
also give an indirect taunt to those against whom he disputes, as we have
seen already this morning. For the things which they had for their virtues were
but gewgawes. Like as in these days in popery, if a man speak of their
holiness and their serving of God: it is nothing else but a making of moppes
and mowes, and a sort of Ceremonies that is to say, a deele of pelting trash.
When a Papist mumbleth up his mattins, when he hayleth or greeteth a puppet,
when he gaddeth from altar to altar, when these hypocrites have lighted up
their candles, when they have sprinkled themselves well with holiwater, when
they have well crossed and recrossed themselves both before and behind, when
they have fasted Lent well, and to be short when they have ouerlabored
themselves to redeem themselves either by Masses or by other abominations:
that is their serving and honoring of God. Besides this, if there be a fair
Lamp in the Church, if the Organes pipe merrily, if there be store of gay copes
and vestimentes, if the puppets be well gilded, if men perfume them thoroughly
and seek their favor with many other such dotages: that is all the perfection
of the Papists. And yet is it but stark leasing, yea and very gewgawes, or
rather utter abominations, how great virtues so ever they esteem them to be.
But we on our side say that Gods service is spiritual and that he regards
not the things that are seen of men, John. 4. c. 23.
but require (...) vncorruptnesse and soundness of heart, Iere. 5. a. 3.
according as it is said in the fyfthe of Jeremy. Contrariwise men persuade
themselves that they shall content God after their own fashion and after their
own customs, and therefore they transform him, imagining him too be like
themselves too follow their lusts and likings. And no marvel though they do
so. For although they profess themselves to be learned in the law: yet do
they not set their minds upon it, neither wot they what it conteyneth.
Therefore let us learn, that if we mind too give our selves too the serving of
God, we must not buz about our own liking and good intents (as they term
them) which are nothing else but illusions of Satan: but we must look what
God commands us, and wherein he will have us to occupy ourselves, which are
the true studies that will bring us too the yielding of obedience unto him.
And it stands us on hand too mark well the text that is set down here:
which is, that if we weerie ourselves never so much in our own inventions:
we cannot say that God accepts any whit of it: for we continue still in our
own nature, which is froward. VVheraboutes then does God imply us? What is it
that he requires of us? First that we should forsake all frowardness,
hatred, rancor, dissension, guyle, harmefulnesse, blasphemy, Idolatry,
cruelty, feercenesse, treachery, spytefulnesse, and enenmitie. Thus ye see
how we may become good men of war, too give our selves too the serving of
God, namely by fyghting against the works of the flesh, not against the
works that are manifest, and which the world condemns or allows: but
against the lusts that lurk in covert. Let us first clenze ourselves from the
filthiness that lies festering within our hearts: and afterward apply our
whole indeuer to the other, Not that we can do it of our selves: but let us be
diligent in praying unto God, let every of us stir up himself early and
late, morning and evening, and upon knowledge of our vices, let us be moved
too sorinesse, and seek succor from whence it ought to come: that is to wit
at Gods hand who must remedy the sore that he has made. Then if we indeuer
our selves too the uttermost to lead a blissed life, too be meek and meelde,
too be patient in adversities and too put up all wrongs and outrages without
^ee^^^^ (...) vengeance: we shall have enough wherewith to occupy ou^ wits,
and to keep our selves from idleness. And as for the Papists, let us let them
alone seeing they dally so with God. For why do they trot up and down after
that fashyon? It is because they never knew how God will be served and
honored: and therefore (too their seemyng) all that God has ordained is
nothing worth in comparison of their own foolish inventions. As for example,
if a man travel honestly for his living, although he have not his fill of
brown bread, yet ceasseth he not to call upon God in the morning, and too
yield him praise at night. And if he have children, he spares all that he can
too feed them and clothe them withal. Ageine if God send him afflictions in
his house, he bears them patiently. If the be a handicrafts man, or have
some other trade of occupying: he absteyneth from deceyuing of his neybors, and
he had lever dye than do any man wrong. Now when a man walks after such
sort, so that he is first of honest conversation, and secondly there is no
pride in him too advance himself above other out of measure, he is not given
too loocenesse, but is sober in eating and drinking, and patient in all
adversities: what is such a man among the Papists? He is (say they) a secular
man: that is too say, a man of the world. Thus ye see what they esteem to be
pureness in the service of God. But we know that the cheefseruice which God
requires, is that we should wholly draw to his Lure, that we should glorify
him both in weal and woe, that we should walk every man in his own calling,
and that there be neither pride, vainglorie, nor envy in us. Those are the
things that God allows. But according to the Papists definition, they that
behave themselves so, are of the world. And where are the popish Angels in
this while? In some Cloister. When these shameless hypocrites have glutted
themselves too the full, and made lusty cheer: they wot not whereaboutes to
occupy themselves, but either in gaming, or else in all manner of wickedness:
for it is well known that all the Couentes of the Popedom are stark
brothelhouses. And would God they were not woorfe than brothelhouses* for
there are committed so outrageous and beastly deeds, as would (...) man's
hear too stand up stiff upon his head too here them spoken off. Too be
short, that state of theirs is horrible.

And yet for all that, they be Angels in respect of the poor souls that
behave themselves after the manner aforesaid. And why? Because they sing
mattins very devoutly, and chaunt mass by note, and are separated from the
rest of the world, so as they be not put to digging of the earth, nor meddle
not with shoomakers craft or tailers craft, nor with any trade else: but give
themselves (ye may be sure) to a contemplative life, and to the state of
perfection. Is it not apparent that the world has bin utterly sotted with
them? But such people as have so transformed God into puppets, are well worthy
to be plundged in so gross and unreasonable errors. But for our part let us
assure our selves that we have a God which is a spirit, and will be served
spiritually as he shows us by his word. Therefore let us be afraid too be
under the fond fancies wherewith those miserable wretches are bewitched: and let
us consider that Gods communicating of himself unto us, is to the end that we
should repair unto him in all holiness, righteousness, and faithfulness, and
therwithall examine our lives by his law, and not by our own opinion, or by
the opinion of the world. Agein let us also have an eye to that which he
allows or forbids, for it is he to whom we must yield up our account, and
we shall have none other judge but him alone. Therefore let us look to all
these things and exercise ourselves in them, knowing that we shall not loze our
labor in being so occupied: and let us let the Papists alone, which break
both their legs and their necks, and know not what they do, saving that they
grieve God and provoke him more and more. To the end then that we travel not in
vain, nor wander here and there after opinions, without having any certain mark
to ame at. Let us exercise ourselves in the thing that S. Paul teaches us in
this text, and then shall we not be condemned for buzying of our heads about
things of nothing, which God blames and misliketh, and also auoweth to be but
trifles.

Now let us cast our selves down before the Majesty of our good God, with
acknowledgment of our faults, praying him too make us so to feel them, as it
may beat us (...) that we being condemned in our selves (...) unto him,
knowing that he is always ready to succor (...) thirst after his grace and
long for it unfeignedly: and that forasmuch as he has given us too our Lord
Jesus Christ, and Christ has taken us into his keeping: it may please him too
pour out the treasures and gifts of his holy spirit upon us, too make us
partakers thereof, and too increase his grace more and more in us, that we may
be so fenced with it, as we may obtain victory against all Satan's assaults,
and against the world and our own flesh. That it may please him to grant this
grace not only to us but also to all people. etc.

The. 37. Sermon, which is the seventh upon the fifth Chapter.
22 But the fruit of the spirit are love, joy, peace, pacientnesse,
gentleness, goodness, faith,

23 Meekness, temperance, against such things there is no Law.

24 Now, they that are of Christ, have crucified the flesh with the
affections and lusts thereof.

25 If we live after the spirit, let us also walk after the spirit.

26 Let us not be desirous of vainglory, provoking one another, and envying one
another.


We have seen heretofore, that if we be willing too serve God, we shall find
enough wherewith too occupy ourselves in chastizing our vices, if every of us
consider to how much corruption and sinfulness he is subject. And saint Paul
has purposely set before us the sins that reign in us by nature, too the
intent we might know whereupon to set our minds to frame ourselves aright to the
obeying of God. For we see how me^ busy themselves about trifling things in
showing themselves willing too serve God: they trudge (...) measure. Howbeit,
all is but vain and unprofitable labor, according (...) we see in the
Popedom, where me^ give the name of Gods seruis to a sort of toys that they
have devised of their own brayn. And yet in all those things though they like
never so well of them, and glory in them never so much, there is naught else
but vanity, and in the mean while they never pass of coming to the
principal: for the world does always seek windlasses. But God sets the right
way before us in his law: and if we intend to go foreward to the true
perfection unfeignedly, we must begin at the forsaking of ourselves, because
there is no wisdom in us that is not cursed, no thought that is not wicked,
nor no desire that is not froward and corrupted. For this cause S. Paul told us
before, that if men be minded to order their life well, first they shall find
enough to occupy themselves withal, if every man consider what a number of
inta^gled and wicked lusts he has in him to be cut up: which thing will not be
done out of hand. And also S. Paul spoke these words purposely to such as
buzied themselves about the Ceremonies of the law. For although they said
generally that the things which God had commanded were to be fulfilled: yet
the chief things that they made account of, were Circumcision and the
Ceremonies, Now hereupon S. Paul tells us that God will have us occupied
about greater matters: that is to wit, he will have us to fight ma^fully against
the great number of things that turn us aside from the right way. And now he
adds on the contrary part, that the fruits of the spirit are louingnesse,
meeldnesse, gentleness, meekness, stayednesse, and such other like things,
and that when all things are thus well ruled, the law has no more power over
us, for we be set free from it, because our Lord Jesus Christ who has
exempted us from it, governs us. To be short, the mark that he shoots at,
is that Christians should be free from the bondage of the law. Not all those
which have the name of Christianity in their mouth, or which make their
braggs of it: but such as show by their deeds that they be members of our Lord
Jesus Christ, inasmuchas they be begotten agein by his holy spirit. For men's
lives must be answerable thereunto, or else all their protestations are nothing
worth, yea and they shall be proved Liars, unless it appear by their works that
they speak truly and unfeignedly. Besides this, whereas S. Paul (...), all
goodness, and al commendable thing (...) ^^utes of the spirit: thereby he
confirms the thing that I told you heretofore: which is, that if there be any
one drop of goodness in us, the same is not of our own growing, neither can we
challenge the praise of it, without doing wrong and injury unto God. For they
be all of them fruits of his grace, and he is feign to put them into us by his
holy spirit. Ye see then that here again we be humbled, to the end that none
of us should deceive himself in thinking that he has any virtue or
stayednesse, or louingnesse, or any other like thing of his own. For until such
time as God have shaped us new again, we be like a piece of ground that is
barrein yea and stark naught. For we not only bear not any good thing: but
also bring forth exceeding much evil, till our Lord have rid us of it: like a
naughty ground, which not only is unprofitable too the owner in that it
yeldeth him neither corn, wine, nor other necessary things: but also brings
forth thistles, thorns, and wicked weeds. Even at the same point are we. And
now we have to mark, (according also as S Paul has declared heretofore)
that love is the sum and substance of the law: which he has set down here
in the foremost rank, not to make us forget the calling upon God, nor the
affiance which we ought to have in all his promises, and the whole service
that is contained in the first table of the law. S. Paul holds not scorn of
those things, neither would he have them rejected: but the matter that he
treats of, is how men may give sure proof to the worldward, whether they be
rightly minded to the obeying of God or no. And I have told you already, that
such proof is seen by our loving of our neighbors, when we be not given
every man too his own profit, but labor in common too nourishe good peace
and unity, and put to our helping hand also so far as God gives us
ability and means wherewith to do them good to whom we be bound by his word.
Thus ye see why S. Paul sets down the word Love in the first place. It
is not to the intent we should so love our neighbors, that God should be
thrust back behind us: but because that in having mutual love and friendship
one with an other, we show ourselves to be rightly given and dedicated to
god: which thing cannot be with (...) trust in him, nor without resorti^g unto
him by prayer and supplica^^^n. Furthermore seeing that all the things which
bear the name of virtue, and are justly commended among me^, are called the
fruits of the spirit: surely it is much more likely that when we should come
unto God, and be armed against all temptations, and be earnest in praying by
means of faith: we be not ready for it if the holy Ghost work not in us. Then
of natural inclination there is not any thing in us whereby we take hold of the
doctrine of the Gospel: neither are we so lightsome as to mount up unto God,
to talk familiarly with him by prayer and supplication, but the holy Ghost
must dispose us too it, by inlightening our hearts with his grace, and by moving
our hearts to call upon him. Lo what we have to remember here. Now whereas S.
Paul matcheth joy with love, it is not only to do us to understand that we
shall be quiet to Godward, and have cheerful hearts, when he shall have
received us to mercy and showed himself too favor us: but he speaks of
another kind of joy, which is that there be no hartburning among us to make us
lowre one at another, nor spite to withdraw us from our neybors: but that we
be gentle and fellowlike, yea and that we be glad when we can aid and succor
them that have need of us. In the.xiiij. to the Romans S. Paul says, Romans 14.
c. 17.
that the kingdom of heaven is joy of spirit: howbeit he takes that word in
another meaning. For we may rejoice in God when he witnesses unto us that he
receives us for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and without that, we must needs
be vexed and turmoyled with such unrest, as we shall live in continual trouble.
It is true that the despisers of God do sport themselves as much as may be in
their iollitie: but yet have they never any rest or joy: for they be feign too
suffer much hartburning inwardly, and God does so sting them with sundry
hartbytings, as they be always in heaviness and vexation: in so much that
when they would be merry, they be feign to play the brute beasts, and to shake
off al understanding, so as the discerning of good and evil is quite and
clean daunted in them. Now it is a cursed joy when men stray away after that
fashion from God, and forget what they be. But (as I have told you already) S.
Paul speaks here of the joy that we have in being conversant with our
neybors. And after the same manner also is the word faith (...) faithfulness
and soundness of heart. (...) is a faith that respects God, and that is the
sure belief which we have of his promises, according whereunto it is said that
we be justified by faith, Rom 5. a. 1.
because it appears that God abolisheth and mortifieth in us whatsoever is of
our own nature. Therefore [in that fayth] we must be grounded upon Gods
only mercy which is showed us in our Lord Jesus Christ. But how come we to
the possessing of so great a benefit? By trusting unto Gods promises, and by
receiving them with all obedientnesse, acknowledging our selves to be damned
and forlorn, and resting only upon him. Ye see then that our faith which
respects God, is an assurance which we conceive of his goodness and love
toward us, to the end we may preace unto him, not doubting but that he
hears us. And for that cause also S. Paul says, that those which have
such faith, do trust boldly in God, and therewithal do also freely and
boldly pray unto him. But in this present text, S. Paul takes faith for the
faythfulnesse which we perform one to another when we walk uprightly, so as
we go not about to deceive our neybour through lewdness or suttletie, nor use
any double dealing, nor any dissimulation to wind about the simple, but do the
same to other folk which we would have done to our selves. Thus ye see how
S. Paul meeneth that faith is a fruit of the spirit. Now he adds
Meekness and gentleness, because that without them it were impossible that
there should be any unity or concord among us. For if every man should be
terrible and void of gentleness, it were much better for us that we were
wild beasts. Therefore we must show a willingness to communicate with
those to whom God has linked us. Too be short, Love is maynteyned by this
meekness, goodness, and gentleness whereof S. Paul speaks here. And now
immediately he adds, Temperance [or stayednesse.] which is not only an
absteyning from other men's goods, but also a sober behavior, and a keeping of
our selves from all loocenesse, excess, and outrage. To be short, S. Paul
has set down these virtues which he rehearses, for Christians, as if he
should say, that if we be governed by the spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ, it
may (...) by our life, for as much as we shall be so hilde in awe, that (...)
shall not run at rouers as these looce lyuers do, but we shall be charitable
and kindharted one to another, so as there shall be no wrangling, no guyle, nor
no extortion in us, but every of us shall content him self with his own, and
indeuer to serve one another turn. But yet notwithstanding we see that all
good comes of Gods spirit. Nevertheless we see also that our Lord Jesus
Christ is the fountain out of which we must draw. And that if we be his,
and belong unto him as members of his body, he will show in all our whole life,
that his receiving of us, and his auowing of us to be his children, is not in
vain. Heerevpon S. Paul concludes, ^. Ti. 1. b. 9.
that against such virtues, (or against the men that are endued with them) the
law has no power nor force at al. And therefore he says in the first to
Timothy, that the Law is not given to the righteous, but to the unrighteous,
and to such as rush out into offenses and misdealings. Then if the deceyuers
that troubled the Church at that time, had known well what is the end of the
Law and the Gospel: they would not have presumed to bring the faithful in
bondage after that fashion. And therefore S. Paul scorning their hypocrisy
which was matched with shamelessness, shows that they pretended great zeal
of the Law, and yet bewrayed all manner of wickedness and contempt of God in
their life: like as now a days the Hypocrites in the Popedom cry out loud
against us, that we overthrow all good works, and intend to bring in a
licentiousness of all evil, and to thrust out all desire of serving God. And
why so? Because we vncace men out of all their fond presumption and self
estimation, and show them that there is none other means to trust in God,
than by resting upon his mere goodness in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
We say flatly that all that ever is termed by the name of merit or deserte,
is stark abomination before God. For so much as they bear them selves in
hand that they be their own Saviors. Ye see then that all loftiness of
man is pulled down by our doctrine. But yet does not that importe, that every
man should take leave to do lewdly, and have no more care of serving God, nor
of standing in awe of him. But contrariwise we say that Jesus Christ is given
unto us, not one (...) obtain forgiveness of our sins at (...) hand by his
means: but also to the end that being regenerated by his holy spirit, we
should walk in newness of life. And now in sooth what manner of men are they
that maynteine the desert of good works so stoutly? We see there is nothing
but all kind of cursed filthiness in their whole life. For if a man would
seek for scoffers that are altogether unholy, and never have so much as any
one feeling that ever they shall come to account, but are utterly doted by
Satan: surely those are even they. Again, when as they magnify good works:
what are the things that they would have men to give them selves unto. To
babble much, to go to mattins and euensong, to trot from altar too altar, too
worship puppets, too deck them trim, too buy store of pardons, too gad on
pilgrimage, and (too be short) too mock God too his face, as though all the
service of God were but a play of young children. True it is that they dare not
say but it is a good and commendable thing to be discrete, chaste, sober, and
so forth: but yet they can easily forbear all those things, so a man keep
their superstitions. Too be short, all Gods commandments are thrust under
foot, and as it were trodden upon, and to their seeming it is no devotion nor
holiness, except a man do all their gay gewgawes and things of nothing. Thus
ye see how the contention that S. Paul had in his time, indureth still at
this day. And for that cause he says, that if his adversaries against whom he
disputes, will maynteyne Gods Law, they must consider well to whom it
speaks, and they must begin at them selves: and that if they intend to make
good scholars, they must teach them soberness, meekness, chastity,
patience, and such other things, and moreover to renounce all their own wicked
lusts. These (says S. Paul) are the true exercises wherein it behooves us to
employ all our indeuer. And in the mean while let us not shut the gate
against Gods children, in bereeuing them of the privilege that God has given
them. For when he governs them by his holy spirit, he will not have them
subject any more too the yoke of the Law. Now thereupon S. Paul adds, that
all they which are in Jesus Christ, have crucified their flesh, with the lusts
thereof. Here he shows that he (...) to have a fleshly liberty, and such a
one as the despisers of God (...) that he requires chiefly, that such as
talk of christian liberty, should show in deed that they have crucified all
their lusts and concupiscences, to the intent thereby to prove them selves the
true members of our Lord Jesus Christ. And this is needful for us: to the
end we may hold us to the lawful order and mark which God points us too,
when we would know what true liberty is. Now a days there are many
Christians from the teeth outward, as far as comes too the eating of flesh
upon frydays and in Lenton: they can welinough mock at the pelting toys of
papistrie: they can welinough say, that if any restraynt be made of one thing
or other under pain of deadly sin, it is but an abuse and mockery: and they
say truth, so they buyld upon a good and sure foundation. But what? they that
are so great talkers, know no whit of our Lord Jesus Christ's office and
power: they know not why he came down into the world, nor what grace he
imparteth unto us by his Gospel: they know not, neither what faith, nor what
prayer is: and yet for all that, they will needs have leave to do what they
list, and that folk should lay the bridle looce in their neck. Of these
wild Christians there are tootoo many now a days. In the mean while the
doctrine of God is blamed by their means. For the enemies of the truth
vpbrayde us with all such as are loose livers now a days, and say that the
same springs of our preaching. For this cause S. Paul has answered his
adversaries, and also armed and fenced us to answer them, to the end to
stop the mouths of all raylers, and of all such as do falsely slander the
doctrine of the Gospel. First of all therefore when the wicked sort say, that
we give an inordinate liberty to all such as seek nothing but to do lewdly:
Let us look back to S. Paul, who tells them that the liberty which we
speak of, serves for none but such as are a law to them selves, namely
through the working of the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. But yet
notwithstanding this ought to serve for a warning to all such as imagine a
liberty after their own liking. Therefore let them understand, that first of
all it behooves them to become members of our Lord Jesus Christ. VVil we then
eat quietly without making any (...) Will we be exempted from all (...)
which do now a days vex the simple and ignorant sort in the Papacy? Let
us understand what Jesus Christ is, and let us be thoroughly his. Let him
govern us, and let his death and passion show their power and effectualnesse
in our whole life. Thus ye see what we have to bear in bind in this text.
And here S. Paul shows again, that the true perfection of Gods children
consists in abacing themselves, so as they follow not the rule of their own
brain and affections: for we be utterly corrupted. Then can we not be but
rebels against God all the time of our life, till we have killed all the
sinfulness of our own nature. Mark this for one point, that our life shall
never be framed to the will of God, except we be utterly changed, both in
our thoughts, and in our affections. Secondly, S. Paul shows that that can
not be done, but by communicating with our Lord Jesus Christ: for it is not
without cause that he uses this word Crucified. For thereby he declares,
that so long as we be separated from our Lord Jesus Christ, and cast off
from him, and not knit unto him by faith, our nature will always bring forth
her own fruits, that is to say, nothing but all manner of naughtiness and
vice. Thus ye see that first of all Freewill is beaten down. Secondly it is
showed us that we can not be partakers of any of Gods gifts, nor of his holy
spirit, but by the means of our Lord Jesus Christ, according as I have told
you already, that we must all draw of his fullness, for he is the only
fountain that is able too suffice us. And if we seek never so far about
elsewhere, we shall find nothing but drythe, and we shall continue a thirst
still: and if we think too fill our selves, it will be but wyndinesse and
misweening, wherewith we shall burste, and yet not gather any good nourishment
or substance. Now heerevppon Saint Paul concludes, that if we live after
the spirit, we should also walk after the spirit. And it is a more easy
declaration of the thing that I have touched already. It had been enough too
have avouched that we can not be set free, but by crucifying all our wicked
lusts: how be it for as (...) (...) Hypocrisy is so great, that they do
always find ^^a^ting holes, and (...)man would be esteemed as an Angel,
though his life be out of order: therefore Saint Paul intended for a
confirmation too add this saying* that if we live after the spirit, we must
therewithal walk after the spirit. As if he should say, that it is not
enough for men too protest them selves to have Gods spirit dwelling in their
heart: but they must show that he is there: for he is not idle. Therefore if a
man will discern whether Gods spirit dwell in us or no, he must come to our
works and to our life: and according as our conversation is, so may he see what
we be, and what is within us, and give judgment by our outward works that
are apparent. As for example, if one would bear me in hand that a block
were a living a man too see too: It stirs neither head nor foot: thrust at
it, and shoue at it, and yet there appears no life in it: and shall he then
make me believe that a piece of stone remoueth from place too place, or has
any power in it, or is a creature that has a soul? Even so is it with those
that boast them selves to be spiritual. For although the unbelievers and
enemies of God be alive as in respect of the body: yet are they dead in respect
of the heavenly life, because their soul is utterly corrupted: but we live to
Godwarde through the grace of his holy spirit. And if this grace be in us, it
can not be idle, as I said before. And that is the cause why S. Paul says,
that our conversation will show whether we live in the spirit or no. The
word walk is very rife in the holy scripture, when the whole ordering of our
life is mentioned: nevertheless here is not only walking. The word that S.
Paul uses imports more: that is to wit, too walk orderly, as if he should
say, that we must frame our selves to the thing that is conformable too the
will of God, and of his holy spirit, and that our life must be so well ruled,
as it may be known that God governs us in deed, and that our Lord Jesus
Christ holds us too him self as the members of his body, and that he has
truly witnessed that he dwells in us by his holy spirit. Therefore at a
word, this thing must needs be known. Now to be short, S. Paul meant
here to bewray the hypocrisy of all such as make fair protestation with
their mouth, and would have men to believe wondrous well of their zeal: and
yet in all their whole life do show (...) at all too come near God, nor any
(...) of his word. All such folk then are here condemned of lying and
unfaithfulness. And therefore that we may discern which are Gods children,
let us come to the examining of our lives. True it is (as I have touched
heretofore) that sometimes the ignorant wretches and such as never had any
instruction in the Law, shall have some appearance of virtue. But if a man
sound them thoroughly, he shall find it is but a shadow, and that they be
not well bent, either too love their neighbors, or to walk according to Gods
will. To be short the examining of our life can not lie. And heerewithall S.
Paul meant also to confirm the thing that he spoke before: that is too wit,
that if our life be to be governed by Gods spirit, then must we travel
earnestly that way, and not in tryfling things that are neither here nor there
before God: according as I have declared already, that such as will needs
be most devout, have neither end nor measure of their superstitions: and when
evening comes they think God to be greatly beholden to them for their
traveling too and fro, and yet notwithstanding all is but lost labor. And
therefore S. Paul tells us, that sith we know that our life is spiritual
(as truth is) and that God also is a spirit: we must understand also that
he will be served faithfully, and that men must not occupy them selves about
small trifles which are but as childrens bables: but that he will have us to
use faythfulnesse, love, peace, and concord one with another, so as there be
no deceit, no malice, nor no rauin among us. Then if we know that the life
which God allows, and whereby we be joined unto him, is a spiritual life:
Let us forthwith (says he) walk in the spirit, that is too say, let us
assure our selves that God allows not any thing but that which is agreeable to
his Law (which for the same cause is called spiritual by Saint Paul in the
seventh to the Romans) and let the proof of the same doctrine show it self
in our conversation. So now whereas other folks run on pilgrimage: let us
occupy our selves in the serving of God, and our neighbors. Whereas these
wretched hypocrites wast al their substance in Idolatry: let us consider that
the true sacrifices and holy offerings which (...) are that we should be
dedicated unto him both in body and sou^^^, (...) ^^ondly that we should so
dispose the goods that he has given us and put into our hands as we might show
by so the same may serve to the glorifying of Gods majesty, and [too the
enlarging of] the dominion of our Lord Jesus Christ. Let all look at him,
let all stick too him, and let all know that it is he from whom all goodness
proceeds. Lo whereunto S. Paul meant too bring us. Now to the intent too make
us the more too abhor all vayneglorie and pride against God, and the said
desire of having credit among men: he says that we must not seek too byte
one another, another must we malice one another. It is as much as if he had said
that ambition or vayngloriousnesse cannot reign in us, but incontinently there
will be hartburning, and every man will provoke his neighbor. For if we be
given after that fashion to vayneglorie, every of us will covet too be
greatest, and it will seem to himself that he has not his right, till he see
his neighbor brought in contempt. Thus ye see what pride brings. It tends
not only too the aduauncing of a man's self against God: but also too the
defacing of such as we ought to honor, at leastwise if they be our inferiors.
For when we have looked well to all, it is certain that even the least sort
ought to be honorable in our eyes. Therefore if we be led with ambition (as I
said before) every of us will be climbing to get higher and higher. Now hereof
must needs spring strife and debate, hartburning, quareling and contention,
and finally deadly enmity. To be short, so long as ambition has his full
scope, and is let alone unbridled, we must needs be at war, as experience
shows toomuch, and would God that we might be feign too seek a great way
off for examples of it. But so soon as men will needs set out themselves,
ambition must needs carry them so away, as too show themselves enemies too
their neighbors. And thereof also proceeds envy. 1. Cor. 13. b. 9.
For it is said that charity is glad of other folks welfare. Have not we
cause too rejoice, when we see God pour out of his gracious gifts upon our
neighbors? yes: or else we pray not unfeignedly for all such as have need of
them. For if it grieve us too see that God grants them too live commodiously
and at their ease: do we not therein bewray that there was nothing but
hypocrisy and fayned^ (...). Also if God give any man the gracious (...) his
holy spirit, it is for the common welfare and edifying of his Church. So
then, in all respects there is cause for us too rejoice, and if we be
rightly qualified according too Gods will, we shall also therewithal love the
profit and advancement of our neighbors. Contrariwyse when every man is
given too himself, and we be driven with this wicked ambition and pride: we
can never look but a skewe at the advantage and profit of our neighbors.
There will always be repining and spiting in our hearts, when God shows
himself bountiful toward those whom we would keep under feet.

Thus ye see that the thing which we have to remember in effect in this
streyne, is that we must learn what it is too belong too our Lord Jesus
Christ, to the end that we take not his name in vain, ne be reproved of
falsehood and leasing before God and his Angels, for glorifying our selves so
foolishly before men. For too the intent we may be our Lord Jesus
Christ's, we must mortify our lusts and affections, knowing that of our
selves we be inordinately given too all evil, and our nature wholly inclyned
therevntoo. Therefore it stands us in hand to turn a new lease. And of a
truth that cannot be done of our own power: but the Son of God is Priest
and ready to help us. What lets us too be made partakers of the gifts
of Gods holy Ghost, that we might prove by our life that we have a true
belief in him? It is our flattering of our selves in our own wretchedness.
Then seeing there is nothing but corruption in us, let us learn too lament,
and let us yield our selves too our Lord Jesus Christ, that he may kill
all wicked lusts and disordinate affections in us by the power of his death
and passion. And therewithal let us consider the grace that God grants us
in that he will have us too serve him freely, so as we should no more be
under the yoke of the Law too be pressed down by it too the uttermost (for
that would be an intolerable burden too us), but be governed by his holy
spirit, knowing that he allows of our life, and accepts our seruis when it
is so framed according too his word, although our zele be not so great nor
so substantial as were (...) know this: and therewithal let us walk in such
(...), as our (...), and as our feet, hands, and all other our members and
senses may show by effect, that as we have bin trained in the school of our
lord Jesus Christ so we have also borne away his doctrine, and that the same
has taken root in us, not too lie hid still, but to yield forth fruit in
such wise as Gods name may be honored, and we show that we be not idle and
unprofitable servants, but that we have bin quickened by the spirit of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and that it is he that governs us, by reason whereof the
fruit of it redoundeth immediately too our neighbors, in so much that when
Gods name is so glorified by us, and we have yielded true proof of our
christianity, men know that whereas we were taught, it was to the end that
all others should reap profit by it. For God has a respect to the whole body
of his Church, Math. 5. g. 45.
and like as he makes his son to shine both upon good and bad: so will he
have the faithful to do good to such as are not worthy of it. Therefore let
us acquaynt our selves with it, and moreover acknowledge that we be nothing,
and that all the goodness which we have is none of our own, but that we have
it of Gods mere grace. And for as much as we be not yet come to the perfection
that were requisite, let us not surmise our selves too be in Gods favor for
any other respect, than that he bears with us till we be come intoo his
kingdom, where we shall have the fullness of all holiness.

Now let us cast our selves down before the Majesty of our good God, with
acknowledgme^t of our faults, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we
may be sorry for them before him, yea even with a true repentance, and desire
to be rid more and more of them, and practice the doctrine that we have herd,
that whereas the blind and ignorant wretches do now adays martyr and tire
themselves to much in excess of their fond devotions: we may learn to hold
our selves too the pure simplicity of his word, knowing that there is none
other rule but that, and that the same is it wherein he will have us to
exercyze our selves, and whereunto it behooves us too apply all our study: and
thereby show that that is the mean whereby our Lord Jesus Christ will have us
fashioned like to himself: and therefore let us go foreward and travel unto
him till we be thoroughly knit unto him, and in the end be come (...) such time
as he shall appear to our full (...), and deliver us not only from this
earthly pilgrimage, but also from all corruptions and all other things which
hinder us from the full inioying of the heavenly heritage. That it may please
him too grant this grace not only to us, but also too all people etc.

The. 38. Sermon, which is the first upon the sixth Chapter.
BRethren, if any man be overtaken with a fault, you that are spiritual
help too amend him with the spirit of meekness: and consider thy self,
least thou also be tempted.

2 Bear ye one another burden, and so fulfill the Law of Christ.


I Have declared heretofore that there is not a more deadly plague than
Ambition, when every man is given too himself and will needs exalt himself to
the contempt of his neyghbors: for then is another indifferency nor measure
kept. Here is now another vice very near of kin to the other: namely when
we snatch at such as have done amiss, to the intent to advance our selves in
comparison of them, which we see to be common a vice in the world. For to our
seeming, other men's virtues are a hinderance to us, that we cannot be in such
reputation as we said would. This is the cause that every of us prieth and
peereth at his fellow, to the intent to disgrace him in such wise as he alone
may not bear away the bell, and by that means have chief praise and
co^mendacion. And although that that be not: yet will it often come to pass,
that we shall be over rigorous under pretense of zele. For this cause Saint
Paul does here exhort the faithful, too do their indeuer too reform a man
with all gentleness, when he has done amiss. And he does purposely (...)
state before us here. For it ought too move us to compassion, (...) ^onsider
the common frayltie that is in us all, as he will touch the same point more at
large hereafter. Nevertheless his putting of us in mind of our infirmity by
nature, is too the end that none of us should climb to high. And furthermore
he adds the word overtaken, meening thereby that it always deserves
gentleness at our hands when we see a man surpryzed by the wiliness of
Satan. For S. Paul spoke not here of such as have rooted malice in their
heart, which are utter despyzers of God, which are altogether heathenish, and
which are so full of poison throughout, that they cannot allege for themselves
that they fall by oversight* for why, they be mad beasts, rushing wilfully
against God, according as we shall see many that manifestly despize all order,
and would have all the world put too confuzion. Such manner of men are not
compryzed in the number of those whom Saint Paul speaks of here. But
although a man fear God and be willing to give himself to his seruis: yet
notwithstanding Satan has his snares ready laid, and catches us oftentimes
ere we think of it. And so you see how we be overtaken or surpryzed. Now
S. Paul tells us, that yet in such faults we must be pitiful still, and
bear with such a man through the spirit of meekness. Howbeeit we must
mark well all the words that are set down here: and thereby we shall gather
the meening of the Apostle. For in very deed here is nothing superfluous, but
every word has his weight. For in saying that we must indeuer too amend
him again that is fallen: he shows that the gentleness which many men use
in flattering such as have done amiss, sauoreth nothing at all of
Christianity. Therefore men's vices must be rebuked, and we must labor
too bring back the party intoo the right way, which is strayed out of it. For
if a man uphold him in his naughtiness, and foade him in it: he betrayeth
him, because he rocketh him a sleep, and by that means sinketh him the deeper
in destruction. Ye see then that the mean which Saint Paul has appointed,
is that if a man have done amiss, he should be amended, howbeit that the
same must be done with the spirit of gentleness and meekness. He could
well enough have used the word Meekness without the word Spirit: but he
has (...) do us to wit that we must have a hearty (...) procure the welfare
and salvation of such as have need too be warned and exhorted when they have
committed a fault: and therewithal he meant also to express that the same
proceeds of God. For like as he is the fountain of all goodness: so also
doothe he give his children some meekness, too the intent they should
follow him and frame themselves after his example. Esai. 11. a. 2
We know that the manner of the holy Scripture is to term the gifts of the
holy Ghost, the spirit of truth, the spirit of the fear of God, the spirit of
wisdom, and such other like, because the fullness of all goodness is in him.
Ye see then that the sum of that which S. Paul teaches here, is that we
must not only love virtue and like well of such as walk in all perfection,
and in whom we can find no blame: but ouermore we must be gentle, in bearing
with the faults of such as are not yet so well confirmed in the fear of God
as were requisite, too the end we may bring them back again into the right
way, that are turned aside or thrust out of it. For if there should be no
meeldnesse nor gentleness in us: as soon as a man had committed any fault,
we should as it were plundge him in despair, and this is seen too much, for
that cause therefore Saint Paul tells us that the meekness or meeldnesse
of Gods children must try it self by releeuing such as are fallen through
weakness, yea and that in such sort, as it may be known that their salvation
is procured. Now I have told you that there are two extremities or two vices
whereof we must beware. The one is, that we wink when any of our friends
have offended God, in so much that even when he has given some cause of
stumbling, we let it slip because we be loath too purchase his displeasure
by rebuking him. And now adays ye see that the common way of maynteyning
freendship in the world, as too give leave and license of all misdoyng, through
Diuelishe dissimulation. For no man can abide too have his galled back rubbed,
another do any men take warnings in good worth, saving they whom God has
touched, and to whom he has given the spirit of obedience too yield
themselves teachable. Therefore such manner of men as these, Psalm. 14. c. b. 5.
will say with David, that they had lever too be (...) and with all
sharpness, than too have the ointments of the flatter (...) ^^ich serve but
too rock men asleep in their vices. Nevertheless ye shall commonly see, that
all me^ covet to be borne withal, and to have no word spoken to them what
soever they do, nor to have their heads troubled with their vices and
misdoings. Every man verifieth this, in so much that God is forgotten, and (as
the Prophet Esaias says) there is no defender any where that maynteyneth the
truth, Esaias. 59. c. 16.
for there is as great confuzion and disorder as may be, and yet men do let all
slip. True it is that if wrong be done to any man, he will not stick to say
that such licentiousness ought too be redressed: but he says not so for any
zele he has to maynteyne the honor of God, it is but only for his own
peculiar advantage, and for the regard that he has to himself. Thus ye see
that God has not any proctors or Advocates to plead his case, but every man
is for himself. Therefore when we see any man do amiss, let us learn that
it is no love nor charity too cloak his evil doings, so as we should
dissemble them and make no countenance at all of them: but that if we have a
care of him that is so fallen, we must turn him away. If a man be in the
mire, we will reach him our hand too help him out: and if we pass by him
and will not seem too see him, shall he not say it is too shameful an
unkindness? Even so is it when we suffer a man too fall a sleep in his
sins: for by that means he is sunk down too the bottom of perdition. Then
is it too great a trayterousnesse, if we do wittingly suffer a man too undo
himself utterly: and therewithal we show also that there is no zele of God
in us. For if he be our father, ought it not at leastwyze too grieve us and
make us sorry, when we see wrong and injury offered unto him?

So then, if the souls which our Lord Jesus Christ has bought so deerly be
precious unto us, or if we set so much by Gods honor as it deserves: it is
certain that we will not so bear with men's faults, but that we will indeuer
too amend them. Mark that for one point. But there is also a contrary vice:
namely over great rigorousnesse. For this is a property of the Hypocrites,
that if they spy a mote in their neighbors eye, they cry out alarm upon
him, Math. 7. a. 4.
and they must needs follow him with hew and cry, whereas in the mean while
a great beam in their (...) as our Lord Jesus speaks of them. For (...)
therefore as there are many that wyden their consciences to swallow up a whole
Ox [in their own caces,] and in the mean season can streyne at a gnat when
it touches other men: therefore we must beware that we be not to rough and
sharp in rebuking of our brother. Besides this, there are also that have an
unadvised zeal, so as they be too sour and bitter, and they are of opinion
that they discharge not themselves, except they proclayme men's faults alowde,
as it were by the sound of a trumpet. And how many warnings are made
nowadayes with an upright carfulness? If a man see any of his neighbors fall
to naughtiness, he ought (if he can have access and entrance to him) too
tell him his fault: but we will none of that. For (as I said) every man
vnderpryeth other, and lies in wayt for him like a spy, too see if he can
find any thing amiss in him, and then uses he sternnesse to the uttermost.
True it is that such as are handled ouerroughly after that fashion, cannot
complain of it. For whereof comes the naughtiness that is too ri^e
nowadayes among men, that no man is warned secretly to the end he might be
brought back unto God, but that the vices which were done in covert are blazed
abroad, yea even to the diffaming of the party? It is for that every of us
shetteth the gate, because our ears are too itching, and we cannot abide too
be told the truth, but will needs keep the possession of all naughtiness,
as though God were deposed from his authority, and had no prerogative of
judgment over us. Forasmuch then as every man would exempt himself from
correction: therefore all are worthy to be handled hardly after that fashion,
and too be dealt with like enemies, and not like brethren. For there can be no
brotherhod among us, unless correction take place, so as every man be subject
to it, yea even willingly. And because we will not in any wise be rebuked,
therefore we deserve well to be handled with such excessive rygour. For this
cause Saint Paul sets down the mean, which is that we must have a care one
of another, so that if any man stumble, he may be helped up again. And how?
By good warnings. For that is the remedy which God has stablished for us by
his word, Howbeeit that in the mean while (...) so eager in rebuking other
men's faults, as too forget to put (...) that is to say, to use the said spirit
of meekness. For it were to small purpose to have Sugar in our mouth, as many
men have, and in the mean time to bear poison in our heart. And therefore
Saint Paul speaks not here alonely of the tongue, ne says that we must have
intioing words: but that in rebuking men's faults we must always be led and
moved thereto by an earnest desire to our neighbors salvation. For it is
certain that if we covet the soul health of such as do amiss, we will
behave our selves soberly, and that soberness will bring with it the
moderation that Saint Paul speaks of, so as we shall not be ouereager, nor
depart from the fountain, which is too beware that we be not too hasty in
fynding fault we wot not why, nor too what end, but that we have a care too
fetch him back again that is in an euill-trade, and be desirous to bring him
with us unto God. To be short, we must covet to have him our brother, that
God may be served of us all and mainteyned in his state. If we be so minded,
surely the rest will follow after. But under the word Spirit we be warned
moreover (as I said even now) that we must be fashioned like unto God,
for so much as he has vouchsafed too choose us for his children, accordingly as
our Lord Jesus Christ tells us, saying: Be ye like unto your heavenly
father, Math. 5. g. 45.
who has pity even on the^ that are unworthy of it. Wherefore if we desire
to be hilde and auowed for Gods children: let us have an eye to the nature of
him which calls us too the likeness of his own Image, which is that we be
meeld and gentle. Now God in his gentleness flattereth not such as have done
amiss. For he hates iniquity, and must needs always show himself an
enemy to it. But we see the thing that is said, namely that God does in such
wise correct his children, Heb. 12. b. 6.
that the chastizements which he uses begin at his own house, 1. Pet. 4. d.
17.
and at his own household folk. Yet for all that, he thundereth not against
poor sinners, but wayteth for them patiently, encouraging them, drawing the^,
bearing with them, setting his grace before them, and showing them that he is
ready to receive them, and has his arms stretched out to embrace them, if
they will come unto him. Ye see then that the first thing which we have to
consider, is that we must fashion our (...) example of our God, so as we
oppress (...) the first da^he in who^ we see any infirmity, but rather labor
to win them, because they be as lost souls. And heerevpon we may also
gather, that such as nowadayes would have vices cloked, yea and borne out
under pretense that God is pacient and gentle, do falsely corrupt the holy
scripture. For nowadayes, if never so detestable crimes be committed, by and
by they allege mercy, o they must be pitied: yea, but such folk blaspheme
God in that they would have us too be more merciful than he is. Surely we
know him too be the welspring^ of all goodness, and it is enough for us if
we can follow him a great way off, and it were a thing to be greatly desired
that we could come nearer and nearer unto him. But when we have streyned our
selves too the uttermost, it is very much if we can have in us but some
little spark of the mercy which is infinite in God. Zach. 1 a. 3.
Nevertheless God promises not his grace, but to such as return unto him.
True it is that he touches them with his holy spirit, and changes their
minds: but yet must repentance always be matched with forgiveness of
sins. Now after what manner is it that men would be pitiful? It is that they
might mock God too his face, that men should wink at their lewdness, yea
and sooth them up in it, that God should be rejected, and that such as are
ready to do still worse and worse, should be borne withal and borne out.
But I have told you that it is too cursed a blasphemy, when men transform
good intoo evil after that fashion. Then according to Saint Paul's
exhortation, let us learn to bring a meekness that may be of Gods spirit, not
too allow of the evil, or to deface the good, but too amend things modestly
with discretion. Therewithal let us learn also to pray God to govern us when
the case requires that we should correct our neighbors, assuring our self
that of our own nature we shall never be able too do it. We know that to
serve God, and to employ our selves faithful in that behalf, we must first
receive of him the things that we want. Now then, let a man streyne himself
as far as he list* and he shall not find himself able to bring one drop
of goodness of his own. But when we come too correcting, there we repre^^
(...) God: and if I mind to tell a man his fault, I come not to him in (...)
private name as his superior: but in the name of God.

Now then, seeing it is so that we execute Gods office in rebuking such as
have done amiss: how shall we be fit for that purpose, except he guide and
direct us thereunto? Therefore let us learn to desire him to guide and rule us
by his holy spirit, when any admonition is to be made, to bring such back
again as are gone out of the right way. And herewithall we must mark also
(as I have said before) that Saint Paul speaks not here of such as are saped
in wickedness, in contempt of God and in rebelliousnesse, but of such as are
overtaken, so as they have some good will to do well, and yet notwithstanding
do fall through infirmity. Therefore this matter must be handled very
skilfully and discretely. For if we will deal alike with all men, it is
certain that we shall oftentimes do wrong too such as have need too be borne
withal, and in the mean while do nothing but inflame the despyzers of God,
and make them more malapart than they were before. Then (as I said) we must put
a difference between the one and the other. For when the Prophet Ezechiell
speaks of the good shepherd: Eze. 34. a. 4
he says that he must bear with the sheep that are weak, and if any of them
be infected, he must heal them by good medicines. But if he should keep one
manner of usage without putting a difference between one and another, how
should he show himself to be a sheepherd in so doing? In like case is it with
all such as deal with the rebuking of their neighbors that have done amiss.
As for example, if there be a shameless naughtipacke, that daily runs
headlong into all naughtiness, which makes none account of Gods word, nor
does any thing but [marre others] like a scabbed Ram that spreads his
infection through the whole flock: or if there be a varlet that is given over
to all wickedness: such a one is not overtaken with sin. And why? For he
has already given over the service of God, he has utterly shaken off his
yoke, and (as I said before) is become a mad beast that pusheth with his horns
against heaven. Such manner of men deserve not too be borne withal by
gentleness: and in this text Saint Paul does quite cut them off and shet
them out of doors. But when (...) overthrown by infirmity, and that the
(...) has caught him unawares, and yet that the good seed of the fear of God
which he had is not utterly waterslaine in him: it becomes us too have pity
and compassion on him. And forasmuch as we may slide every hour, let us
learn to call yet earnestlyer upon God, that he may govern us, yea and let
us also bear well in mind how Saint Paul adds, look to thy self that
thou also be not tempted. Here he changes the number. He had said, Brethren
if any man be overtaken, help ye to amend him. And now he turns his tale
too every man particularly, saying: Look to thy self: and that is too the
end that this warning should be the more vehement, and touch us the nearer.
For we see that when one speaks in general terms, every man thinks it to
be spoken to other men, and there is none of us all but he would shift out
himself as much as is possible. Then if it be said, behold, all are inclyned
to this or that? very well, he speaks to the whole company, but in the
mean while no man is touched with it as he should be. Saint Paul therefore
does expressly change the number here, and he thinks it not enough too warn
all the faithful and the body of the whole Church in common: but he draws
every man aside and says, look to thy self, and examine what is in thee: for
thou also may be tempted. Truly there is not any reason that ought sooner to
persuade us to be gentle toward such as have done amiss, than when we know
that we our selves also have need too be borne withal. And even the very
heathen men have alleged the same. For they have said, that it is a great
cruelty in a man if he cannot find in his heart to bear with the
infirmityes of his companions, seeing there is not any man which is not weak
himself. It were impossible that any two men should live together in the
world, if they be not pacient to bear one with another. Then were two men
enough too set all the whole world on a broyle, if they would not bear one
with another. And even they that think themselves to be most perfect, shall
find that they themselves had need to be borne withal. For surely if we be
not utterly blockishe, we will hate the evil that is in our selves. And we
need not any man to trouble and vex us: every (...) in himself by being
grieved at his own imperfections. (...) it is so: what remains but that the
same should induce us to deal meeldly and gently with such as are fallen
through infirmity? Thus ye see what we have to mark well here. And soothly if
we search well the cause why many are inflamed with such inordinate zeal, and
storm so extreemely against small faults: it is that they think not upon
themselves. Now then the order that we must keep in this behalf, is first to
condemn the evil whatsoever it is: mark that for one point. For if we
condemn the evil but in this man or that man, and ouerslip it in others: it
is a toke^ that we be not led with a right meening mind to the end that God
should be served and honored, but that there is some secret root of malice in
us, Prou. 10. b. 12.
according as Salomo^ says, that enmity bewrays vices, and every man
finds fault with him to whom he bears any grudge. Ye see then that the
first rule which we must keep, is too condemn the evil wheresoever it be
found, even because it is contrary to Gods will. That is one point. The
second is, that every of us must examine himself. For surely the nearer that
any evil is to our selves, so much the more must we have it. If I see a
despizer of God, it will grieve me more than if he were ten leagues off from
me, and that I knew not his faults. Now then it stands us on hand to have
an eye to our selves. For let us take this similitude, the nearer neighbors that
we be, and the more familiarity that there is among men, the more must we put
the thing in ure which I have spoken of: that is to wit, the more must every
of us show other his faults when he has offended. For God has knit us
together with condition that if I have a friend, I must reform him rather than
a stranger. But now when evil is to be condemned, who is nearer too me than
my self? Ye see then wherein a man shall know whether we seek the honor
of God and the clenzing away of vice or no: namely, if we be rough and sharp
in bridelyng of our selves, and that when we rebuke others, we first condemn
all our own vices, and show that we mislyke them, and that we seek too
amend them as much as we can. Ye see then that the way for us to judge of our
neighbors, is first of all to condemn our selves. And this warning serves
not only for the things past, but also for the things to come. S. Paul
therefore says not, (...) have offended heretofore: but he say^^ (...) that
thou (...) tempted hereafter. And truly we ought to walk continually in fear
and carfulness, not that we should not always rest upon Gods grace and
favor, but that we must not be retchlesse. For faith imports not that we
should be careless of all things: but rather (as Saint Paul shows us in
the second to the Philippians) that forasmuch as we be not able to do any thing
of our selves: God must be feign to guide us by his spirit, and when he has
given us will, he must also give us power to perform it. For So Much therefore
as we hold all of God: it behooves us to walk in fear and carfulness. And
so when we consider our faults past, and look well upon our present state,
we have continual cause to cast down our eyes. In deed when God vouchsafes
us the courage to maintain goodness, and too condemn naughtiness, he
grants us great grace in making us judges, notwithstanding that we deserve
to have our mouths stopped. Yet nevertheless it behooves us too learn to be
lowly minded in rebuking the faults [in other men] which we have already
condemned in our selves, seeing that we our selves may daily and hourly, yea
and every minute of an hour fall. Then since the case stands so: let us
pity such as offend, for they be all of them myrrours of our own frailty,
because we see there what we our selves are furtherforth than God holds us
up by the grace of his holy spirit. Moreover, in admonishing such as have done
amiss, we may yet (as I told you before) offend God in being too hasty, too
rygorous, and too unkind. Although then that it be a commendable virtue to
admonish our neighbors: yet if we be too lavish, all will turn into vice,
except our Lord do so restreyne us, as we keep an even hand and swerve not
aside too any of the two vices that I have touched before. Thus ye see what we
have too remember concerning this saying of Saint Paul. Now he says
expressly, you that be spiritual: meening to do us to wit, that we be the
more bound too hear with the weakelings, when God has strengthened us by his
power, according also as is declared in the fourtenth too the Romans. And in
deed if God distribute his grace more too one man than too another: it is not
(...) or that man with all, but rather too hold up such as are not able (...)
go: like as if two men do go a journey together, and the one feels himself
weary, so as he is not able too draw his legs after him: it is certain that
he which is strong and lusty will not run before him as it were to spite
him, but will restrain himself to his companion, yea and he will toll him
forward* saying, Go too man, pluck up a good heart, and let me help thee my
self. To be short, he will do all that he can to cheer up his fellow that is
so faint. After the same manner also must we bear one with another, since we
see that God has called us all in common, and chozen us with condition that we
should go all together with one accord, and every man reach out his hand too
his neybour (as the prophet Esaias speaks of it) and say, Esaias. 2. a. 3.
Go we, let us go up to the hill of the Lord. It is no reason then that such as
have received a larger measure of Gods gifts, should go about to oppress
others: but rather that they should bear with their infirmities, and be
touched with the meeldnesse that we have spoken of. Thus ye see how S. Paul
says expressly, that the more that our Lord has set us forward, the more
ought we to draw others after us. And hereupon he adds for a conclusion,
Bear ye one another burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. When as
he says that we must bear the burdens [of our neighbors:] he does yet
better express the thing that I have told you heretofore: that is to wit,
that he speaks not here of the despizers of God, which run into all
licenciousnesse and are saped in malice and sturdinesse: but of such as
travel and go forward in all goodness, and have an earnest good will too
attain to it, and which do even groan under their sins, as under a burden
that is to heavy for them. For the better understanding hereof, we will set
down a similitude contrary too that which is set down here by Saint
Paul. He says that such as are overtaken with their sins, are made as it
were too stoop under the burden. And why? Because they are angry with
themselves. Not that they fret or chafe against God through pride and disdeyne:
but because they be not able to withstand Satan so steadfastly and stoutly as
they feign would. But as for these roysters that are given too all evil, they
be so far off from stouping under their burden, that they rather ride (...)
triumphing and vaunting themselves, (...) though they would utterly defy God.
Thus see ye the diversity that is betwixt them which are to be borne with,
and those against whom all rigor may be used. For the one sort is bowed with
the weight of the burden which does in manner wey them down: and these are
the same whom our Lord Jesus Christ calls to him, saying: Come unto me all
ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you, and you shall
find rest for your souls. Math. 11. d. 28.
Our Lord Jesus calls not all men without exception unto him, but gives a
mark too such as may have access to obtain favor, namely that they be
ouerloden: that is to say, they welter not in their sins, ne take pleasure in
them, neither do they boast of them as folk paste shame: but they would feign
have ease, and can find none in them selves. Therefore he says he is ready
to deal gently with them. And for the same cause also does S. Paul in the
seventh to the Romans say, that he does not the good which he would, but
the evil which he would not. Now S. Paul speaks there of him self: in so
much that although he were as an Angel of God in respect of his conversation
in this world, and as a myrrour of all holiness: yet does he mourn still,
and say he is accursed. And why so? Because he was hilde as a captive in
prison, in so much as he was not at liberty too give him self fully unto
God: for he was hindered by his own sinfulness. Now if S. Paul were in that
taking: how shall we do? By the way we see how this word Burden is to
be understood, where it is said that we must bear one another burdens.
Herein Saint Paul exhorts us to hold up one another: and if any man miss
of his duty, we must not therefore give him over, but be inclined to
pitifulness still, and use the forementioned meekness. To be short, he says
that we be knit together with such condition, that if any of us be ouerloden
or wax faint, the rest must supply his defaulte and weakness (as I said)
even as inclined thereto by nature, without being encouraged by the word of
God. If we be going of a journey in a company together, and see any of the
(...) every of us will help to harten him: and for (...) ^ooing thereof, (...)
unload him, and every man take a piece of his burden. In like wise let us
consider that the sins which we commit through infirmity, are burdens,
and that in such caces it behooves us too put under our shoulders, too ease
such as are welneere wayed down with them. Not that we should use any
flattery, as I have said before: but that we should help too amend them.
And for proof hereof, if a man offend God, and I ouerpasse it, so as he
continues in his naughtiness: the burden increases in such wise, as it is
inoughe too break his neck. For whereas he had but one burden: behold now
are many mo added, too bear him down to the ground, even for want of
warning. In so much that if he had bin admonished at the first, he had bin
eased of his lode: where as now by cloking of his vices, we be the cause
that the poor wretch can never be relieved. And therefore it behooves us too
use the foresaid mean: which is, that in bearing with the weaklings, we
must not fail too touch them to the quick, that they may be made too
acknowledge their faults, too the end too amend them. Now for a conclusion
Saint Paul says, that we must by that mean fulfill the law of Christ. It
is not too be doubted but that S. Paul meant here after a covert manner too
nippe those against whom he disputed heretofore. For we have seen how that
in those days there were many that would have had men too keep the
Ceremonies of the Law: for that was all their holiness and perfection.
Therefore because they ever had the word Law in their mouth, and bare men in
hand that they should discharge themselves to Godwarde by ceremonies: S. Paul
says unto them, Go too, we have the Law of Jesus Christ, who is a faithful
declarer of the will of God his father. Then if we will have a true
interpretation of the Law: we must not seek it elsewhere than in Jesus
Christ, who is the everlasting wisdom of God, and was sent too bring us all
perfection of wisdom. Seeing it is so: let us above all things look what he
commands us, and consider what yoke he lays upon our backs or necks:
which is, that we should love one another, as it is said in the.xiij. of
Saint John, I give you now a commandment that is both new and old: John.
13. d. 34.
which is, that you love one another (...) unto we must apply all our whole
mind* namely to bear with such as have need, and to reach out our hand to
such as are ouerloden, to relieve them. By what means then we shall fulfill
Christ's Law: and when we have so fulfilled it, we may defy all such as
condemn us. Those therefore which fulfill the Law of Christ, shall be no more
subject to the ceremonial Law as they term it. It is true that we shall
never fulfill the Law of our Lord Jesus Christ, neither in this respect, nor
in [any] other. But S. Paul shows us the mark that we must labor too come
at. Although then that we be continually on our way so long as we be
conversant in this world: yet must we not run at adventure, without knowing
whither we go. For we have our mark set up before us, and thither must we
enforce our selves. So then, that we may serve God according to his own will,
let us learn too give our selves wholly unto him: and to the intent it may
be known that his will is too hold us in such unity one with another: like
as he has knit us together in an inseparable band, so let us seek to draw
our neybours unto him, and therwithall let us be patient and meek when aught
is to be corrected: and yet not be willing that vice should be nourished
through flattery and dissimulation.

Now let us kneel down before the majesty of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us feel them more and more,
so as it may make us to mourn before him with true repentance, and to ask him
forgiveness of them, and to labor always to be knit unto him, and to be rid
of all the corruptions of our flesh, and to be clothed with his righteousness:
and that in the mean while he will bear with our feebleness, till he have
fully delivered us. And so let us all say, Almighty God heavenly father. etc.

The. 39. Sermon, which is the second upon the sixth Chapter.
2 Bear ye one another burden, and so fulfill the Law (...)

3 For if any man esteem himself to be somewhat, whereas in deed he is nothing:
he deceives himself.

4 But let every man try his own work, and then shall he have glory in
himself only, and not in another.

5 For every man shall bear his own burden.


WE have seen this morning, that we must bear with men's infirmities where we
see there is any fear of God, or any good seed, and that they be not utterly
wilful in wickedness. And so ye see in what caces we ought to be pitiful.
But when we see men so proud, that they despise God with stubborn outrage: it
is not for us too use any meeldenesse or gentleness in that case, but for as
much as they be seen too praunce so in their braueries, that loftiness of
theirs must be plucked down, when they exalte them selves after that fashion
against God. Also I told you therewithal, that too keep a good mean in
rebuking such as have done amiss, every man had need too bethink himself:
for we must first of all condemn our selves: that is the point which we
must begin at. And when we see what we our selves are, and that we have
great store of vices in us worthy too be rebuked: then have we there on the
other side wherewith too humble our selves, and too restrain us from using too
great or excessive rigor toward such as have need too be succored, and
too be borne withal. Saint Paul therefore continues still the same matter,
saying, that he which weeneth him self too be any thing, is nothing, but
deceyueth him self: For every man shuts his eyes when he should think upon
his own sins. Of a truth there can not be so much as one drop of virtue
in us, but by and by we magnify it: but if our vices be apparent to the whole
world, in so much that even little children can laugh us to scorn: yet can
not we our selves see them. Now S. Paul intending too correct this vice,
says that men are loathe too be deceived, and yet nevertheless every man
beguyles him self willingly and wittingly, even through his own ouerw^^^
(...) by this means he brings us too the very welspring (as I said this
morning) which is that if men were not vayneglorious and desirous of
estimation, surely there would be another manner of modesty and soberness
than is too be seen. But for as much as every man is puffed up with pride,
therefore we covet superiority above all men, and seek occasion too tread
them under foot, or else to ouercountenance them in such wise, as they may
seem our underlings. Therefore it is impossible to redress this outrage of
coveting after that sort too carpe and bite men: except we be first rid of
this fond desire to be had in estimation, and to be as it were advanced
above others. No doubt but men can talk well enough of humility: but there
are very few that understand what the word means and imports.
Nevertheless S. Paul shows us here, which is the true humility: that is
too wit, that men should utterly abace them selves, and consider that they be
nothing worth, for then shall they be rightly humbled. When humility or
lowlynesse is talked of in common speech: it is taken to be but a device. For
every man can well enough say by his honesty, that he is nothing: but in the
mean while they cease not to swell like Toades with the poison of pride. But
S. Paul teaches us here a far other lesson: which is, that we must put
away all opinion of our own wisdom, and of all the virtues that we can
imagine our selves too have. For it is said here in one word, that we must
think our selves to be nothing. And in very deed, the saying that is set
down here must be laid forth thus: Seeing that men are nothing at all:
they that presume upon their own virtues, and glory of them, beguile them
selves willingly. Therefore let us take this part, namely that we be
nothing. It is true that God has left still some marks in us, whereby it may
be perceived that he has exalted us in worthiness and excellency above the
brute beasts, in as much as it was his will to create us after his own
image. Then if we have respect too the thing that God did put into us, the
same ought too be esteemed still* but yet for all that, in respect of our
own persons we be nothing. For we be wholly bound unto him (...) that we
have received, have we received it for our own ^^^thinesse sake? Is it given
men too make them own estimation and praise of it* No, but rather too increase
our shame, because that all the understanding, judgment, and discretion that
is in us, is corrupted and marred by our own naughtiness. Too be short, we
be like a stinking and rotten vessel, and Gods gifts are as good wine that
is put into the vessel: and so by that means all is marde. Even so is it with
us. We be vessels. And what manner of vessels? Vessels infected with the
corruption of sin. God puts of his gifts into us, too the end he might
be glorified by it. Now, may we deserve too have any praise thereby before
men? No, but rather blame, because that we by our sinfulness do mar the
good things that God has put intoo us. Moreover, where as it is said that
we be nothing: it is because we can not but apply all our understanding and
reason unto evil, and for that we will needs be counted wise, Genesis 6. b. 5.
[when as notwithstanding] God auoweth that there is nothing but naughtiness
in us, and that all our thoughts, are but vanities, leasings, illusions, and
deceiptes. Again, where as too our seeming we have a will whereby we choose
both good and evil: the same will is a bondslaue too sin, so as we do
nothing else but fight against God. As much is too be said of all our
affections. And if we have any thing else that seems commendable, God
distributeth it too every man as it pleases him self, and moreover he is
feign too continue the thing that he has begone, as we see by experience.
What cause then has he too boast, which has a sharp and subtle wit,
seeing it is not he that has made him self to excel, as though he had bin
his own maker? Therefore we must hold all things of God, and do him homage
for them. Again we see that even they which take them selves to be iollyest
fellows, eue^ they that are most honored in the world, who must not be replied
against when they have once spoken the word, I say we shall see even them
made brutishe when it pleases God. So then, let us conclude that Saint Paul
does justly abolishe here all the power that men presume to have, to the end
that they may be rightly humbled, that is to wit, to (...) our selves to be
aught worth. Mark (...) or one point. Now hereupon he mocketh the fond
vaynegloriousnesse which rauisheth their wits, because there is not any man
that would willingly be beguyled. And in very deed it is a grief to us when
we see any man go about to wind us in by wylynesse and dissimulation, and we
can by no means brook it: and yet for all that we shall find no greater
deceyuers in the world too us, than our selves. Every man deceyues himself,
every man overthrows him self, yea and that in a manner willingly: and what a
folly is that? Now then we see S. Paul's drifte, and also the lesson that
we have too gather of that sentence. For as much as every of us will needs
advance him self by abacing his fellows: therefore S. Paul tells us, that
if we make a good and right trial of the things that are in us: there will
not be found so much as one drop of virtue that deserves praise, at
leastwise in respect of our own persons. For we be nothing, and there
needed but one blast too make clean dispatche of us. Therefore it is but a
foolish ouerweening that lets us too walk in simplicity. And so let us
understand first of all, that we can not challenge any thing too our selves
without treason to God, because it is a robbing of him of the right that
belongs to him, and which ought to be reserved unto him, and that is to our
own destruction. For in good faith what shall we gain by it when we shall
have abused men, and when we shall have bin taken for other than we be? To be
short, when we shall have bin as Idols, what will be the end of it but our
own decay and confusion? Then seeing it is so: let us learn too be cast down
and laid flat upon the ground, that we may be thoroughly grounded in our God.
And to bring that to pass, let us learn to magnify him only. And in the
mean while, if it please him to exalte us, let us not cease to keep our
selves in continual awe with soberness and modesty, knowing that we have
nothing of our own, and that whatsoever God has given unto us, he must be
feign to preserve it in us from time to time, and that we must so hold all
things of him, as to make a willing sacrifice and oblation of them unto him,
indeuoring to employ ourselves in the service (...) the measure of grace which
we have received of him, and yielding the praise thereof too him unto whom it
belongs. This is in effect the thing that we have too remember upon this
streyne. Truly it is hard too bring us too this reasonableness. And in good
soothe we see the great contentions that are now a days about Freewill and
men's own virtues, as though men were able to advance them selves, and to take
the grace of God, and by that mean to deserve well. But all this proceeds of
this, that men are forepossessed with such diuelishe pride, as they will
evermore needs be somewhat of them selves. And therefore it stands us so
much the more on hand^ too put this doctrine in practice. Certaynely we can
not profit at all in Gods schole, Ps. 143. b. 6
nor in the holy Scripture, till we have known that we be nothing at all,
too the end we may come too draw out of the fullness of our Lord Jesus
Christ. But that can we not do, except we be first utterly dried up in our
selves; and confess with David that we be as the earth that is scorched and
cloven with heat, and have no whit of wetting or moisture, other than it may
receive from heaven. Hereupon S. Paul adds, Therefore let every man try his
own work, and then shall be have praise in him self, and not of other men:
that is to say, not by comparing of him self with other men. Here S. Paul
remedieth yet one other vice which is to common, and yet notwithstanding we
will all of us grant it to be deadly of it self, and that al of us are
attainted with it: namely that we esteem our selves as little Angels, when
other men are worse than we, or at leastwise when we find the^ not better. And
that is the very thing that rocketh so many wretched souls asleep nowadays,
making the^ to forget themselves, so as they make no reckning neither of God
nor of their own salvation. It is because they see that the whole world tag
and rag does go that trace. If we take a whole town, and ask them from one
to an other how they behave themselves, surely every man will have his excuse
and they will all pretend this for a buckler, Tush we must do as other men
do. As much will they say in cities and countries. To be short, we will needs
be like coliars sacks (as the Proverb says) one of us makes another black.
And again, we bear our selves in hand; that we be quite and clear before (...)
is as bad as I, we see that the world is no better, it is apparante that all
men do so. Howebeeit, besides that these shifts can not purge us, they be an
occasion too harden us in all naughtiness, and to make us rebelliously to
despise Gods justice, as though we should never come to account of our doyngs.
So have we a very good and profitable exhortation in this text, when S. Paul
says that every man must try his own work. True it is that the word which he
uses, might be taken for to approve or allow: but it agrees not with the
matter: for he speaks here of the trial or examination that every man ought
to make of himself, without comparing himself with others: 2. Cor. 10. b. 7.
according as we see how in the second to the Corinthians, he taunteth such as
had measured themselves by others men's yardes. For S. Paul said unto them,
Every one of you consider what he has done, and when ye have well laid all
your percells togither^ what will you show? Therefore every one of you must
come and as it were lay himself upon the rack, that it may be seen what manner
of man he is, and what he has done: and then may judgment be given of him.
Even so is it said in this text, that every man must try his own work. As if
he should say, we will needs be advanced one above another, but if it be
cast in any of our teeth that we have done amiss, by and by his cloak shall
be, that he has a great sort of fellows: but that shall never go for payment
before God (says S. Paul:) every man must shole out himself, and set himself
alone aside from the rest, and understand that he shall be acquit or condemned
before God, not thereafter as another man shall be found to be better or worse
than he, but after the rule of the judge, that is to say, after his word. For
God has on the one side his own word, and on the otherside our life. Therefore
the true balance whereunto we must come: is not too set down the multitude [for
our excuce] and to say, such men or such have misinstructed me, I have followed
that which I saw, it was the common fashion, I was feign to do so whithe^ I
would or no: for I was carried away, because I was not able to stand against a
multitude. No, none of these things will go for payment before God, it will not
serve our turn to say, that we have many fellows. But (as I have said
already) the true (...) Counterpeyse, and [to consider] that although the whole
world draw us unto evil, yet we shall not be excused if we prefer not God
and his word before all men's doyngs. And here first of all, in following the
matter that S. Paul lays forth, when account is to be entered into, we must
call our selves home to examine our own lives thoroughly. For a man shall never
be touched with true repentance, nor never acknowledge his sins without
hypocrisy, till he have shet his eyes against all the doyngs of other men, and
fall to considering thus with himself: Go too, what is it that my God
commands me? After what manner may I appear before his judgment seat?
How will he judge me? According too his word. Behold here in effect how
we may be touched with the true fear of God: behold also how we may mislyke
of our sins, and finally be humbled: namely, not by looking upon this man
or that man, but by examining truly what we ourselves are, and therevppon by
resolving our selves fully, that only Gods word shall bear sway with us, and
that it is not for us to give judgment by the things that are seen in the
world. Let that serve for one point. And herevppon also we may gather a
general lesson: namely that it is to gross an oversight, too think too bury
our faults and too escape vnespyed, by having a great number guilty as well as
our selves. And yet nevertheless it is the common excuce now adays, as I
have touched already: but yet for all that it is but a tryfling excuce. If a man ask why the Papists are so dull, and why they give no ear too any
reason, tell them what ye can, but account it as nothing: it is because they
judge by comparison, saying: All the world does thus. Too be short, God
seems unto them too be barred of all liberty, when the world behaueth it
self otherwise than he has commanded by his word. But it is too no purpose
for them too set down and object such examples: for they cannot prejudice
God, that he should not always condemn such as have done amiss. Though there
were a thousand worlds, yet should they all go to wrecke before him,
specially if men came with such statelynesse, as too say, Thus and thus do
we. And who are you? Thus ye see in effect wherevntoo this text ought to
serve us that we may take profit by it, (...) ^aue every man too try his
own works. And it is purposely said his own work, too bring us too the
consideration of our whole life. For he means not that we should take a
piece of it and let the rest alone: but that like as God has written all in
his records, so we on our side should search thoroughly by parcelmeale wherein
we may have offended, and what vices and infirmities there are in us. That is
it that S. Paul meant by the word work. For it may happen now and then, that
in some one point we shall have served God faithfully, but yet howsoever it be
done, there is still some infirmity in it. Agein we be faulty of so many
imperfections, as it abasheth us too see it, and we cannot but even loathe
ourselves.

Therefore let us learn to examine our own lives well, before we judge of other
men's. For seeing that God does us the honor to make every of us his own
judge: we do but increase our own damnation before him, when we be so rough
and severe toward those that have offended, and forget our own sins. Now
whereas S. Paul says that every man shall have praise in himself only: it is
not meant when men examine themselves, they shall find cause in them wherefore to
be praised: but that the true praise is that which has some substantialnesse
in it self: which is, that every man know what he himself is, and judge of
himself without comparing with others. As for example: it is always said that
a purblind person is cleersighted, among the^ that are stark blind. And among
the black Moors, he that is tawny will seem white. If judgment be given of
a white man when he is among a dozen Moors, there will be no whiteness unto
his. But if he be brought ageine among his own countrymen, he will be found
to be a far other than he was taken to be. If it be said, Lo here a man
that is cleersighted, and yet he is but purblind: his cleersightednesse shall
be but in comparison of them that are stark blind: for his eyesight is not
clear and sound in deed. Even so, too judge by comparison is a very fond
thing. Thus ye see in effect what Saint Paul meant to say. He meant not that
when we have examined our life, we have wherefore too commend and esteem our
selves: but that all the praise (...) challenge too themselves, are but wind
and smoke, and stark lies, because their gazing is at themselves, as if a man
should be in love with his own image.

Mark me a little child when one shows him a glass, he knows not whither
it be himself or another, whom he sees there, and yet is he altogether fond of
it. Even so is it with all such as believe themselves to be wondrous
fellows. And why so? Whereupon do they ground themselves, or what reason
moves them, but that they seem to themselves to be of more value, than they
that were able to show them the way? For see here what they will allege. O
(say they) such a man is well esteemed, but yet he has such a fault and such
a fault in him. So that when a man's vices are searched out, if they be
condemned, ye see it is but a sport of little children. Therefore not without
cause does S. Paul say, that to make a a good trial, that we may have a well
grounded praise and such a one as may stand before God, we must try ourselves.
If a man say, yea: but may a man praise himself? It is so certain that we
must be void of all glory, to put in ure that which we have seen in another
text, where it is said that we must glory in God. The question then is not
whither men may be praised or no: but S. Paul has said condicionally, that
if any man will be praised of God, he must withdraw himself as it were into his
secret chamber, and consider what manner of one he is: and then will he be no
more so foolish as to commend himself or to say, tushe, I am worth as much
as such a one, I am as good a man as he. When this greere is pulled down:
then shall a man see whither he ought to be praised or no. Now of a truth, it
is certain that there is not one spark of praise in us, at least wise that we
may chalendge as our own. Nevertheless we shall not fail to have praise in
our God: which is much better than if we were hoyssed above the Clouds. For
when me^ deceive themselves with a vain opinion, or that the whole world
laugheth upon them: it seems to them that they fly in the air: but it is
the next way to make them tumble down and break their necks. Lo wherevntoo
all this presumption that blinds us serves us. But when we once know what it
is too seek praise in God: then are we in the way too be rightly knit unto
him, and so shall we stand upon a good and sure (...) and esteemed. According
whereunto we see how S. Paul glories in his good conscience and in his
uprightness. He says that they who^ he has won unto Jesus Christ by the
Gospel are his Crown or garland. And all Gods servants may say as much.
Nevertheless, it is not meant that they must part stakes with God, as they do
which allege their own virtues and deseruings, who out of all doubt do make as
it were ydolls of themselves: But that the faithful having confessed themselves
to be nothing at all but by Gods free goodness: rejoice in the things that he
has given them, always reserving too him his due. Therefore when we desire
not too have any thing too ourselves alone from God, but depend upon him and
upon his mere grace: then shall we have praise, howbeit in our selves (says
S. Paul) and not in other folk. Now whereas it is said But in ourselves: it
is not meant that the praise springs in our selves, and that we be not
sinners: but he has an eye too that which I have told you already: which is,
that so long as men stand upon comparing of themselves with other folks, they
do but deceive themselves. For it will seem that we be little Angels: and
yet for all that, we shall be never a whit better than Devils. And why? For
we lyken ourselves but too such as are stark naught and utterly corrupted.
Now if ever this warning were necessary, it is most necessary now adays.
For although there have bin much corruption even ever from Saint Paul's time
hitherto: yet at this day it is come to the full heygth of it. And in very
deed it seems that all states and degrees have conspired against God. We
see then that the world rusheth forth as it were into a furious rage, too
make war against all equity and vpryghtnesse: and yet we cease not too
sleep still in such confusion. And why? Because every man does so. And by
that means God is as it were driven back. Think we that we by our
iniquities shall thrust him out of his seat, or bereeue him of his authority
of judging the whole world? No: For all of us without exception must appear
before him, and there we cannot shocke ourselves together too say, Sirs let us
stick too our tackeling, for we be too great a multitude God with one blast
of his mouth is able too sincke (...) so, let us put the thing in practice
which is spoken here by Saint Paul, and let every man keep good watch over
himself. And when we see blasphemy, whoredom, wantonness, Loocenesse,
drunkenness, gluttony, pylling and polling, perjury, treason, envy, and
such other like things have their full scope: Let us be sorry for it, and yet
let us not think that because the thorns among the which we walk do
scratch us, therefore we be discharged: nor that it may avail us when we
can allege, that other men have bin the cause of our starting out intoo lewd
behavior, or of that we have bin carried away in deed as it were with a
whirle wind. I say let us not think that that can avail us: but let us
follow Gods word when it is preached unto us: Let that be all our wisdom.
Let that be all our counsel, according as it is said in the hundred and
nyneteenth Psalm, that Gods commandments are the Counselors of a faithful
man. When a young man that is ready too fall too unthriftiness has a
governor too hold him in awe, he will be restreyned for a time. Now truly
Satan has great store of allurementes, and infinite means and occasions to
break our necks withal: But God of his grace gives us counsel, he sets
his word before us.

Therefore it is good reason he should win so much at our hands as too be
herd of us, and that we should frame our selves too him: for what shall it
advantage us too have alleged a hundred thousand times that we have done
as other men did? It is all one as if we should say, Tushe sir, we pass
not so much for GOD as for men, we have preferred the world, which led
us too unthriftiness, and withdrawn our selves from all goodness. Is this a
reasonable excuce? No: Is it not all one as if we should spit in his face,
and bid him back and get him hence, that men may have full swaye among us,
for we must do as they do and frame our selves too the bent of their bow?
Thus ye see in few words too what use we ought now adays too put this
doctrine of Saint Paul's. And for the same cause also he adds, that every
man shall bear his own burden. As if he had said, every man shall be
combered enough for himself, without helping (...) this sentence may be
applied too many uses, yea even without turning of the words from Saint
Paul's own meaning. For if this reason that every manne shall bear his own
burden before GOD, be alleged as a general matter: then uses he the word
Burden, too cut off all excuces, too the end that men should think that
all their shyftes and startingholes cannot avail them: and that is well
worthy too be marked. For we see what malapertnesse is in us: we would
be ashamed to stand in contention with creatures as we do with our GOD, and
for proof thereof, if God press us, we will never leave our replying and
murmuring, till we be more than convicted. Ye see then that Saint Paul's
setting down of this word Burden, is as if he should say that we cannot
accuse GOD, nor win any thing by standing in contention with him. For why?
Whence comes the condemnation that presses us? Is it of that God stretches
out his arm too make us feel his power in ouerwhelmyng us? No, but every
manne shall bear his own burden.

Now it is very true that Gods wrath is lykened too a burning fire which
consumes all: Psalm. 50. a. 3
but in the mean while, whence comes the wood of the fire that consumes us?
What kindles? What maynteineth it? It is we our selves: Our sins are (as
ye would say) the wood, and our wicked lusts have kindled the fire. Even so
is it as in respect of the word Burden. It is true that it is Gods hand
which presses the wicked: but yet notwithstanding if they look upon the
very cause, they shall find it to be their own sins. Thus much concerning
the word Burden. Now after that S. Paul has stopped all mouths, and showed
that we must quietly receive the judgment that God shall give upon us: he
tells us that every man shall bear his own burden. And thereupon we have
to gather the thing which I have touched already, namely that every man shall
be combered enough with himself. And S. Paul does purposely say so, because
that when I refer my self to custom, and say, the fashion or guise is so,
and every man does so: it is all one as if I would unburden my s(...) But
now (...) whither they whom I allege for my warrant be strong enough, and
whither their shoulders be able to bear my burden.

Behold, God calls me, and I must be feign to yield up an account of my
life: and I shall go seek warrantes too answer for me. And who be they?
Every man shall be combered enough in answering for himself: there is not that
man which has not faults ynow of his own already. And how then could they
bear my burden if I should cast it upon them, seeing they be so sore laden
already with themselves, as is able too wey them down a hundred times? Is it
not then a great folly for me to bring such warrantes before God? I am guilty
of a hundred thousand faults, I shall be put there into the throng among the
rest, and if I examine my self rightly, I shall find my self worse than
guilty as I said, and yet for all this, I will satisfye God with saying, I have
followed the common trace. While I go about to discharge my self after this
fashion upon others, a thousand persons or twain shall fall upon me, and by
that means my burden which was too heavy already shall be increased and be
made much heavier: and so ye see we shall still abide in confusion. Now
therefore we see what folly it is too allege men, as though they could
defend us against God, or that we could be exempted from our deserved
condemnation by making a number of bucklers after that sort, too sheelde
ourselves against God: as who should say, the matter were doubtful who should
get the upper hand, Esai. 40. b. 8.
whither Gods word which must endure for ever and cannot be impeached, or
else our lusts which are fleshely. For whereof comes custom, and fashion,
and all that men term lawfulness, and antiquity or prescription and such
other things? Of nothing else but that men will needs be wise in despite of
God: and moreover are carried away with their own wicked lusts, and every man
would have the bridle slaked, to take leave too do all manner of lewdness. Ye
see then that we cannot bring any warrantes too set against God, but we make
open war against him. To be short, if every of us consider that he is
ouerloden with his own faults, he shall have cause to humble himself. For
there is not any man which is not beaten down to the ground if God list too
enter intoo (...) execute rigor toward him, and even the ryghtuousest men of
all, shall have somewhat continually in them that is worthy of blame, so as
they shall be confounded. Let us acknowledge this, and yield God the whole
praise, suffering our selves to be governed by him. And let us go back again
to that which S. Paul told us heretofore: that is to wit, [to beware] that
we deceive not our selves wilfully, when we would show our selves hardy and
bold in correcting, rebuking, and amending one man or other. Let us not be so
foolish as to justify our selves by comparison, as who should say that God
ought to hold himself contented with our rebuking of others after that manner,
and for that there is some show of virtue in us. Let us not stay upon any of
these things, as is told us us here, but let us mark also by the way, that
whereas it is said that every man shall bear his own burden, we have right
great need of our Lord Jesus Christ's help, 1. Pet. 2. d. 24.
and that he should take all our burdens upon him, according as in very deed
he has borne all our sins upon the cross, as says S. Peter in his first
Epistle. True it is that the matter which S. Paul handles here, is none other
than the same that I have declared already: that is to wit, that we must not
imagine that men are able to warrant us, for the rightuousest man alive is
combered enough with himself. And furthermore, that if our Lord had not regard
to hold us up, we should be oppressed under our burden. Yet notwithstanding
every man must answer for himself, and Gods word must have the maistrie as I
said before. Thus ye see what S. Paul intended to tell us. But yet further, let
us think a little upon our selves. If every man should be feign to bear his
own burden, who were able to endure it? We should needs be borne down. For
if a man had but some one sin in him, behold hell were ready too swallowe him
up. Surely the weight of one sin is heavier than a stone that were able to
crush all our limbs and bones a pieces. Now it is no talking of any one, nor
of a hundred: the multitude of them is infinite. How then shall we stand in
judgment before God when he brings us to account? Who can say that he
comes frank and free? To be short, we see that if there were not a remedy
in the matter that S. Paul tells us here: we shou^^ (...) we must repair
to our Lord Jesus Christ, for it is he that has borne all our burdens, as I
have alleged already. Truly the redeeming of us did cost him dear, and if we
seek heaven and earth throughout for the price of a ransom, we shall not
find any other than him, that is able too pacify God. Then had we never bin
sanctified, except the son of God had given himself for us. Esaias. 53. b. 45.
And in very deed the prophet Esaias shows how he bare our burdens. Namely
that he felt the pains of death, and that the father was feign to wreake
himself upon him, as though he had bin an offender and guilty of all the
sins of the world. Now therefore we must resort unto him, according also as
he allureth us to him. And by the way, if any man allege that here seems to
be some contrariety, considering how Saint Paul says that every man shall
bear his own burden: the answer thereto is easy. When the Scripture
speaks too us of Gods justice: it says that every man shall be recompensed
according to his own works. After which manner Saint Paul speaks in
the.xiiij. to the Romans. According as every man shall have walked in his
conversation in this world (says he) and according as he shall have wrought
in his body: so must he receive his reward. That is the order which the
scripture keeps in speaking of Gods justice. Yea, but in the mean while it
excludes not the remedy that is given us in our Lord Jesus Christ, whereby
men are succored. Lo how God succoureth his elect, and such as he has
reserved too salvation: that is to wit, after he has chastized them, he
reaches them his hand, and lyfteth them up again when he has cast them
down. And truly we should not know of what value the grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ is, neither could we taste of it, neither could we ever be
partakers of it, unless we were utterly confounded in our selves. Therefore
let us learn to feel our burden in such wise, as too bow under it, (as
has bin declared this morning) and let the same lead us too true humility.
And afterward, when we have felt the burden more than we are able too
bear: let us repair too our Lord Jesus Christ, who promises too ease us,
Math. 11. d. 28.
so we seek our whole rest in him. So then, we see that Gods grace is not
excluded when his justice is spoken of. For it stands us in (...) ^^ayes too
his mercy. Iam. 2. b. 13.
Whereas it is said that he which shall have been a cruel and merciless
person, shall have justice without mercy: thereby Saint James does us too
understand, that our Lord has his judgment against the wicked and the
reprobates, to recompende them according to their misdeedes: and again that he
measures his own otherwise, that is to wit, that after he has condemned them
in themselves, and made them to feel their diseases thereby to bring them to
true lowliness: then he sets them up again. Then must we first be stricken
down with Gods hand, and afterward be lifted up again by his gracious
promises, in that he tells us that in our Lord Jesus Christ we shall find
all that we want. Thus ye see in sum, after what manner we must practice this
text: namely that in admonishing our neighbors with a gentle and meeld spirit,
and being also humble and m^ke our selves, without presuming any thing upon our
selves, we must examine well our own lives, so as we may daily bewail our
sins and be sorry for them, to the end that we be no more deceived with
hypocrisy, but labor to withdraw our selves from the world, to the intent we
surmize not that we shall escape Gods judgment by our shifts. So then, let us
bear all these things in mind, that we may submit our selves to the pure
word of God. And whatsoever men do to turn us away from it, let us not suffer
our selves too be seduced. And for the bringing hereof to pass, let us flee to
our Lord Jesus Christ, knowing that how desirous so ever we be to give our
selves wholly to the serving of God, yet we be so ouerloden with sins and
imperfections, that they were able to sink us down to the bottom of hell, if
we had not one to hold us back, that is to wit, our Lord Jesus Christ, who
has borne all our sins, and set us utterly free from them, too the intent
we might hereafter come before God with our faces upright.

Now let us acknowledge our sins with such humility, as every of us may
confess, yea even unfeignedly, that we are all forlorn and paste hope, except
this our good God have pity upon us: praying him nevertheless, too make the
fruit and virtue of the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ auaylable,
not only in hyd^^^ (...) which we have committed already, and in burying
them out of rem^^^^aunce: but also in clenzing us daily by his holy spirit:
and in holding us up continually, till we be come to the perfection wherevntoo
he calls us, and be delivered from the prison of sin, wherewith we be yet
inclozed. That it may please him to grant this grace, not only to us, but
also too all people. etc.

The. 40. Sermon, which is the third upon the sixth Chapter.
6 Let him that is taught in the word, make him that teaches him partaker of
all good things.

7 Deceive not your selves: God cannot be mocked. For look what a man
sows, that shall he also reap.

8 For he that sows in the flesh, shall also of the flesh reap
corruption. But he that sows in the spirit, shall of the spirit reap
everlasting life.


We see well enough that wheresoever S. Paul was known, he could not be
suspected to be a man much given too his own profit. For although it were
lawful for him to have his finding, because he bare abroad Gods word: yet
notwithstanding (as we see) he forbear that liberty, Act. 20. g. 34.
to the end to prevent al occasions of stu^bling. And he protests that he was
fain to labor day and night with his hands to earne his living. But yet was he
so much the better able without suspicion to call upon the negligent sort to do
their duty, as we see in this text. He commands men to find their teachers,
and not to suffer them to want any thing. Now if Saint Paul (as I said) had
bin a covetous man in scraping too himself other men's goods, or if he had bin
desirous too set out himself in pomp and superfluity: he should have had
his (...) have bin told him that he spoke for himself, and that it had bin no
giving of himself to the service of God. But forasmuch as he had showed
sufficiently by experience, that forgetting himself and having no regard of
his own person, he sought nothing else but to advance the kingdom of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and to edify his Church: therefore he might rebuke the
unthankfulness of such as behaved themselves amiss toward their
sheepherdes, in abridging them of sustenance for their bodies, whereas by their
means they had food and sustenance for their souls. Now it is a very unkind
dealing, when a man considers not that he which brings him the doctrine of
salvation, is as a fosterfather sent unto him of God, and at least wise finds
not in his heart to give him bodily food. Therefore when men are so retchlesse
in that behalf, they bewray a contempt of Gods word. For nature ought to
teach us, that when we be in any man's debt, we should streyne our selves to
the uttermost to requite him the like: and if we be not able to do it: then at
leastwise to show that it is not for want of good will. But in this case, like
cannot be requyted for like. For Gods word finds not any thing in the
world that may be laid in balance against it. Yet notwithstanding, such as
are taught, ought at leastwise not to spare their temporal goods, for the
finding of those at whose hand they receive the inestimable treasure of the
Gospel. And verily we see how it has always bin the policy of Satan, too
spoil Gods Church of good Sheepherdes and ministers, by after a sort staruing
of them. Satan's vpholders shall always have enough to cramme themselves
withal: according as we see how that in the Papacy, these idle bellyes
which do nothing else but bark out their Masses and Mattins, are crammed too
the full. Though all the world should hunger and thirst for it, those kind
of people shall never feel penury: yea and they shall have good store of
provision though all the world starve in the mean while. But clean
contrariwise, when such as serve God shall have showed the singular zeal and
care which they have for the health of men's souls: men let them alone, and
think them greatly bound unto them that they give the^ the heering. Well (say
they) we have heard him (...) him well, he has done his duty. And how many
are there nowadayes that (...) contribution when they come too here a Sermon?
They could find in their hearts that God should never be spoken of, because it
is a melancholic matter too them. Whereby we see, that the Devil has by
that means given a pushe, too rid away all teaching, and too bring to pass
that there might be none but Idolles, nor any man care how he behaved
himself. Then was it not without cause that Saint Paul was desirous to
remedy such inconvenience, saying, that he which teaches ought at leastwyse
to be nurrished and mainteyned, and that he which receives the doctrine of
salvation, is bound at leastwise to give of his goods and substance, to him
that has ministered spiritual food unto him. And Saint Paul speaks here
expressly of Gods word. For whereas humane sciences have always bin so highly
esteemed, that such as have professed them, have bin mainteyned: the word of
God, which surmounteth all other things, is as it were cast down. Therefore
Saint Paul blames men's naughtiness, saying: See what a worthy thing it is
to have Gods word brought unto you: See what fruit redoundeth unto you by it.
For we be all miserable and cursed, saving that God calls us to him by means
of his word: for that is the power which he spreads over us to gather us
intoo his kingdom. Since it is so then: how can you be nigardly of the
transitory goods of this world, that such as travel for your welfare and
edifying, should not at leastwise be so mainteyned, as they might give
themselves wholly unto that, and not be drawn away by cares that might
stop them and hinder them of doing their duties? The word that Saint Paul
uses here, is Cathechise, which signifies too teach, train, or instruct,
and thereof comes our word Cathechisme, which signifies a Teaching,
Trainment, or Instruction. Then he that cathechyzeth, says he: that is to
say, he that is a faithful Teacher to edify the people in Gods word, let him
be mainteyned by such as are Cathechyzed, that is too say, by such as are
taught, or as are brought as scholars unto God. Now we see Saint Paul's
meening: and therevppon we have to gather, first of all that we must not take
any nowadayes for Ministers and Herdmen of Gods Church, but such as bring his
word. Mark that for one (...) for our behoof so to do. For the Papists
boast that they have the Church on their side. But it is certain that it
cannot be verified of Gods children, that they should be a flock without a
guide. Then what are the marks of the Church? That there be a flock
gathered together, and that therewithal there be a sheepeheard too lead the
sheep too our Lord Jesus Christ. And in good soothe the Papists allege also
that they have a Hierarchy, that is too say, a holy and sacred Soueraintie,
but in the mean while the mark that Saint Paul sets down here, is not
too be found among them. For we see that all the horned Prelates, and all
the route of the Popish Clergy, have no more but the bare title. For where is
the said word of God? They think that that were a steyne to their state: it
is enough for them to do their Ceremonies and gewgawes, and they bear
themselves in hand that they have very well discharged their duty, when they
have so played an interlude: and so those Hipocrites do nothing else but fill
the world full of their abuses and Illusions. Therefore let us learn to
discern Gods true Church, from all the Synagogs that Satan has builded in
the world, and wherewith he dazeleth our eyes nowadayes. That is to wit,
when Gods word is preached faithfully, let us conclude that God also does
both know and acknowledge the flock that is assembled there. And here ye
see how they ought to dispose the goods of the Church, as Saint Paul
shows. Furthermore whereas he says, Let those that are taught impart all
good things: it is not meant that they should bestow such abundance upon the
preachers of the doctrine of salvation, that they should be ready too burst
with it. For the superfluity of riches has bin a deadly plague, when a number
of men were moved, and driven by fond devotion, to give their substance to such
as they thought worthy to possess the greatest part of the world, whereby
they brought all to horrible confusion. And therefore we must not think that
Saint Paul meant too enrich he Ministers of Gods word in such wise, as they
might have wherewith to riot with all excess, or as they might have wherewith
to mainteyne a dissolute life in pomp and bravery: Saint Paul meant not to
open a gappe for (...): but only meant to do men to understand, that they
ought to succor the^ (...) all their needs, so as they should not be driven
to extreme penury.

And it behooves us to bear in mind how that in another place he says, 2.
Tim. 6. b 8.
if we have wherewith to feed and cloth our selves, let us be contented. Also
we know that God has a care of all creatures: and therefore much more of his
faithful ones. So then let us live soberly, as if we had but a day to live,
and let us not make a hoord of the transitory goods of this world. When the
ministers of Gods word bear this lesson in mind, namely to live soberly and
thriftily, and not too have a care so full of unbelief as should torment them
and burn them, and provoke them to heap up vnmeasurably: then will they
content themselves with a little, and yet notwithstanding men will be
bountiful and liberal too them without their craving of it, so as they shall
always have wherewith to be fed and clothed. And in good faith, besides this
that has bin said, we see that Saint Paul did not only practice this
doctrine himself, but also exhorted his brothers and companions to the same.
For in the twentieth of the Acts he alleges principally, that he had
traveled and taken pains with his hands to get part of his living: howbeit
that it is much better to give than to take: for (says he) the thing that we
ought to have learned in the school of our Lord Jesus Christ, is that we
should be better apayde when we have occasion to do good, and to give to the
relief of others: than when we receive to become rich our selves. For it
cannot agree with Gods servants, that they should covet to hoord up. To be
short, now we see whereat Saint Paul amed: namely that he meant not to give
bridle to the preachers of Gods word, to have a delicate and deintie table, or
to be brave to the worldward: but that they should have wherewith to find
themselves soberly according to their degree. And therwithal also he blames
the unkindness of the world, for that they which are bound to their Shepherdes
do show themselves so niggardly, that it seems to be as it were a plucking
out of the guts out of their bellies, when they be spoken too for the relief
of the need of those to whom they be bound beyond measure. Now forasmuch as
that vice has reigned at all times in the world, and the devil (as I said)
has by that ^^llicie given (...) ^^urage the ministers, that there might be
no more teaching and instruction: let us learn that Saint Paul has not
without cause set down this rule, that they which take peines in preaching of
Gods word, must have wherewith to find and mainteyne them. And we see
nowadayes a greater churlishness in the world, than that which S. Paul
blames and condemns. For they that are at no charges at all with them, will
not fail too grunt and grudge when the ministers of Gods word be talked of.
O (say they) these fellows must be nurrished in idleness: verily as who
should say it were idleness too serve God and the whole Church. Again, the
Apostles (say they) did another so nor so. No, but it is apparent that the
Apostles were fetched a far off: and every man did streyne himself for the
same, not only in his goods, but also in his own person. If any Apostle
were too be accompanied, it appears that the rich and welthie men passed
the sea with them. And now adays there shall be nothing but murmuring and
grudging at Gods servants, though they be enterteyned nigardly. But this
discovers and shows the wickedness of those repyners, and bewrays them
to be Heathenish folk, that could find in their hearts too live in
barbarousnesse and beastly conversation, without having any doctrine of
salvation, and that all were thrust under foot, that every man might live
after his own lusts. So then, let us bear in mind the thing that S. Paul
tells us here, to the end that such as are called too the state and office
of preaching Gods word, may know that where as they be found and maynteyned,
it is because they should take pain, and profit the whole people with their
seruis, and be thereby the more provoked to do their duty warely and
carefully, and finally be quickened up to become so much the more diligent.
And let not men envy them nor grudge against them when they have convenient
finding and interteynment, seeing that God has so ordained: and we our selves
also do see reason why it should be so. Now hereupon S. Paul adds, Be not
deceived, for God is not mocked, and look what a man sows, that shall he
reap. S. Paul, in willing men not to be deceived, shows sufficiently that
men have at all times had store of shifts, and that when they intended too do
or say (...), they have euerpret^^ (...) some cloak. But here he cites them
to Gods judgment, as if he should tell them that they might well enough
content men and stop their mouths: but yet for all that they must be feign
too come to account before the heavenly judge. And therefore all your shifts
(says he) will stand you in no stead. It is true that these excuces will
easily be admitted among men, and (as I have touched already) many men will
hold their ministers at the staves end, and there shall be nothing but
quareling with them. For their ears are so itching, that a man shall hardely
find one of a hundred which will not be glad to here such matters, and to
add some skoffe besides, or else too make the sauce sharper. This is too
common a case. Nevertheless Saint Paul's doctrine extends generally too all
the excuces that we be wont to make when we would justify our evil doing,
or make men believe that the Crow is white. First of all therefore let us have
an eye too the ground that Saint Paul treats of here. Now the case
concerns the finding of the ministers of Gods word. He wills men that
they should not beguyle themselves. And why so? For it is a fond thing to
say, why should not the Ministers of Gods word labor for their living, seeing
they ought to give example unto others? When they come out of the pulpet, can
they not spend the rest of the time in some labor, that they might not burden
the Church? This will easly be received of such as gabble after that
fashion, thinking themselves too have a good case, and too be very zelouse of
the common welfare and of the order of the Church. But such men deceive
themselves. For there is nothing in them but malice, and Satan thrusts them
forth thereunto, to the end to make the world to loathe the doctrine of
salvation, or at leastwyse too set light by it and to skorne it. [That is the
very welspring], thither must we go, and there must we hold us. So then, it
is not without cause that S. Paul warns the Galathians, too beware that they
beguyle not themselves in using these fair colors. And secondly we must also
apply this warning of Saint Paul's generally to all the couertes which we take
in going about too disguize things, for we will always have wherewith to
clear our selves, if men will believe us: And there is not so very a
naughtypacke but he will still have some shifte too conceal his own sha^^
before men* (...) if we were a hundred times convicted, yet the Devil would
ever put some deuyce in our mind, too set a good face upon a foul matter. And
because we be inclyned thereto by nature, and hardened therein by custom: it
stands us the more in hand too mark the thing that S. Paul tells us
here: which is, too beware that no man beguyle himself, and that we err not
wilfully. For it is certain that hypocrisy shall never deceive men, till they
beguile themselves willingly and wittingly. The hypocrites shall now and then be
deceived, and yet notwithstanding be convicted therewithal, and they shall
have such hartbitings, that they shall be the first that shall condemn
themselves, though all men else did acquit them. But there are that fall
asleep, and bear themselves in hand that nothing is amiss in them. Yet
cease they not therefore to have some pricking within the^: and although they
be blind, yet does God make them inexcusable, because he quickneth the^ up,
and they seek shifts still to entangle themselves in, so as they themselves
perceive not the mischief, that they might repent the^ of it. Ye see then that
the woorst kind of Hypocrisy that can be, is when men deceive themselves by
fond flattery in alleging this and that, and in seking to shift off the
matter, not only before me^, but also before God. Now S. Paul says here,
that God will not be mocked* And if he should say, that such as beguyle
themselves after that fashion with their fond excuces, are mockers, yea and
very mockers of God. For if we bare such reverence too God as we ought to do:
it is certain that when we be cyted before his majesty, we would sound our
selves to the hard botto^ of our thoughts and affections, so as there should
not be any thing that were not examined to the quick. All they then which make
so light a matter of coming before God, as though he were but some little babe
and might play with him at their pleasure, do thereby show themselves to be
full of ungodliness. Now therefore we see how profitable this text is for us,
where S. Paul having warned men that they should not beguyle themselves,
adds that God cannot be mocked. This should seem not too make too the
purpose. For what though we be deceyuers? does it therefore follow that we
be mockers of God? Yea says Saint Paul. And for proof thereof, ye seek
vain shift (...) your selves to them. But if you looked rightly upon the
deed, and were not wrapped in your own maliciousness: surely you should
have a righter judgment than you have.

What causes you then to fall asleep in your so fond excuces? it is because
ye consider not that we must all of us appear at Gods judgment seat, and
that it is he which searches men's thoughts, and from whom nothing is hidden.
But you take him too be but an Idol: you would bear him in hand that he
ought to be contented with your fools bables: and when ye have beguiled men
and laughed them to skorne, ye think that God is of the same stamp, and use
yet greater boldness toward him. Therefore it is certain that all such as
flatter themselves and seek startingholes, are Infidelles, and the thing it
self shows them to be plain mockers of God. Now although this saying be
short: yet ought it to make us quake, for as much as we here so great a
thunder, or see such a lightning coming upon us from above. And I pray you, is
it a fault too be pardoned, when men that are but stark rottenness, do so
vaunt themselves against God, yea even to mock at him? Surely we know it is
the greatest reproach and spite that can be done unto a man, too laugh him to
skorne after that fashion. If it be intolerable among us that are nothing:
will God suffer himself to be mocked? Saint Paul therefore has well given
us occasion here to look nearly to our selves, and to walk plainly, and
not too use our skoffing tricks, as though we thought to mende our market by
it, for as much as God is provoked by it, as though we defied him, or as though
we intended too dispossess him of his right, and to make him believe that a
man might pluck him by the noze, and do all manner of villainy to him and he
not perceive it. Were this saying well marked, we would walk in another
manner of awe than we do: but we see how men become Heathenish, yea even
wilfully, and wex so hardharted, that they regard another shame nor honesty
when good or evil comes in question, but ye shall see them corrupt and
pervert all doctrine with full mouth, and cast out blasphemies agayst God. Ye
shall see then now adays that all Tables, all houses, and all streets are
full of mockers of God. And whereof comes that? It is true that there are
many Hypocrites and self soothers: Howbeeit, the Devil has so possessed
some, (...) spit openly (...) that is too say, they defy God without any
remorse of conscience, and thereby it appears that they be given up too a
reprobate mind, and spirit of madness. And whence proceeds such
malapertnesse of aduauncing men's selves so against God? As I told you before,
it comes of the said hypocrisy, when we think to disguise things in such
wise by our subtle slightes and fair replies, that there is no more difference
betwixt white and black. So much the more therefore does it behoue us too
bear well in mind this warning of S. Paul's. Now hereupon he proceeds with
the matter that he had touched, in so much that he extends it yet further, in
saying that look as we sow, so shall we reap: He that sows in the spirit
shall of the spirit reap everlasting life, and be that sows in the flesh,
shall reap corruption. To be short, here S. Paul likeneth all the study,
care, and pains that we take, unto seed which husbandmen sow. For wherefore
do men buzie themselves about this or that, or wherefore do they travel and
take pains, but for some end which they have purpozed to themselves* I say,
even because they hope for fruit to their commodity: that is the very cause
why they be not weerie of their labor. As for example: he that intends too
get much, will suffer hunger and thirst, cold and heat, and nothing will
appall him. And why? For his covetousness carries him on still, so as he
forgets all things else, and tormenteth himself more than if he were in his
enemies hands: nay, his enemies would not torment him so much. So then, when
a man takes great pains too gather goods, it is like the sowyng of a
husbandman: and he hops that harvest will come, and that he shall gather it
up again in the end. He that would advance himself too the worldward,
dares not sleep half his fill: and what seeks he by his watching? To come to
some honor or worship, and to win credit. Well then, Ambition is the
harvest of them that covet worldly honor. Their desire is to gather. And what*
The thing that their own nature likes and ^ongeth for. Even so is it in all
other things. Like as an unthrift will labor too satisfy his appetite, and he
will not stick the rather to do some lewd pranke, as too play the bawd; or
some other like thing. And to what end? To the end he may eat his fill and
fare delicately or else play the drunkard. And othersome fall too robbe^^ and
murder that in fine they become arrant Thieves. Lo whereunto men's lusts
bring them. For they purpose with themselves to make a harvest: that is to say,
to have the thing that they lust for* though it be to their ruin and
confuzion. But howsoever the world go, if ye consider why men give themselves
to one thing or other: ye shall find that they always hope for a harvest. So
then, the things which they do, are the seeds of the labor which they hope
to gather fruit of. Here S. Paul says, that after as we sow, so shall we
reap. And afterward he opens himself in saying, that the one sort sows
too the spirit, and the other sort too the flesh. Now to sow to the spirit,
is too withdraw a man's self from the world and from this transitory life,
and to know that we be created not too tarry here beneath, but too pass
forth on till we be come too our inheritance: and that our life is not to
be here but for a little while, and to walk away (as has bin said in the
Psalm that has bin song and shall be song again), Psalm. 90. a. 5. 6.
so as our being here, is not too abide here for ever, nor as though we had
an everlasting dwellingplace: but God gives us as it were a short walk, and
causes us too make but a turn or twain, and streytwayes after says unto
us, Come away Sirs and return ye intoo dust, as Moses also speaks in his
song. Seeing it is so, if we bethink our selves well to renounce all our own
lusts, then shall we sow too the spirit, that is too say, we shall see that
it behooves us too apply all our study too the heavenly life wherevntoo we be
called. Ye see then how the one sort, of whom the number is very small and
scant, do sow too the spirit, because they starte not out intoo worldly cares
too be tied too them, but consider that God calls them higher, and therefore
prepare and indeuer themselves to come thither. The other sort do sow to the
flesh: that is to say, they be so wholly possessed with a beastly affection,
that too their seeming there is nothing too be compared too this life. And
truly if ye mark at what mark men shoot, ye shall find that the world
holds them back well near all. Ye shall scarce find one among a thousand
that goes any further, too consider that this world is but a shadow that
vanishes away, and too bend themselves earnestly and rightly too the heavenly
life. Therefore all men welneere do sow to the flesh. True (...) that their
respects (...)-what differ. For one is a whorehunter, another a drunkarde, the
third a niggardly pinchpennie, and another a spendall. Then if ye look upon
the humors of the men, they be diverse and as it were repugnant, so as the
one hates the other. And wherefore? Because (says he) he is not of my
nature, he and I cannot agree. But howsoever the world go, if a man sifte
them, he shall find that all of them sow too the flesh. Therefore there are
many sorts of of sowyng: but yet notwithstanding all of them stick fast
here beneath, so as they cannot consider wherevntoo God calls them, and
wherevntoo they ought to apply themselves. For some would be rich, some would
have honor and credit, some would live at their ease, and take their
pleasure, some would have this, and some that: but in the mean while all of
them poare upon this transitory life, and cannot lift themselves up. Now
Saint Paul says, it is good reason that we should reap according too our
sowyng. They then which do so give themselves to the world and sow too the
flesh, shall (says he) reap corruption: that is to say, in the end they
shall perceive that all the things which they esteemed so highly, were but smoke.
True it is that this word Corruption might be taken for everlasting death: but
that is not Saint Paul's meenyng. For he intends to say that men are
destitute of wit and discretion, when they will needs entangle themselves in
their blockish and gross cares. For why? if a man ask them: go too, what is
the world? They will say, it is a shadow that slippeth away. And what is our
life? It is nothing. And what are the goods of this world? They be but a
dream. All of them will say thus much, and yet nevertheless they be so
ravished, as a man cannot tell how to pluck them from it, and the Devil
holds them as it were bewitched, so that God cries out at their ears,
wretched men where are you, and yet they go on still too plundge themselves
deeper in the quamyre. And although they know well enough that all their
lusts are nothing, and that this life slippeth swiftly from them: yet will
they needs be wedded to it still. Although then that God do cry too these
vnaduized folk to bring them intoo the right way: yet are they so dulled that
they cannot obey ^^^er the Counsel nor the warnings which they here. Thus
yeeree why S. Paul says, that such as have sown after that manner, shall of
the flesh reap corruption. But they (says he) which sow to the spirit,
(that is to say, which know that there is a much preciouser life than this
wherein we be, and set their whole affection and mind thereupon) shall reap
of the spirit everlasting life. That is to say, because they have bin governed
by Gods spirit, and have labored to come unto him and too be knit to him:
therefore is their reward also ready for them. Now here first of all we be
warned, to think better upon all our thoughts, doings, attempts, wishes, and
indeuers, and to consider well too what end they tend. For this similitude
shall always be found true, that we do then sow, when we apply our labor or
travel to any thing. Therefore let us look well to our selves, and consider
that although God will have us to gather Corn and wine in this world for the
sustenance of our bodies: yet notwithstanding he calls us yet higher, and
will not have us to be hild still here. Wherefore let us learn to seek
first that God may reign, and bear rule, so as we may yield our selves wholly
to him and his righteousness, and that the care of this transitory life dull
us not, as I have said before: but but that it may be as an income to the
principal whereunto we must go, that is to say, to the kingdom of God. To be
short, let us consider that God has put us into this world to sow, that is to
say, not to be idle nor unoccupied. And how? Truly the Ministers of Gods word
ought to sow, to the end to gather in such a harvest, as they may offer up to
God as an holy offering. And their sowing is too teach faithfully, to the end
that Gods word may bring forth fruit, and his name be glorified and blissed,
accordingly as our Lord Jesus Christ said to his Apostles, John. 15. c. 19.
I have chozen you to the end you should go and bring forth abundance of fruit,
and such fruit as shall last for ever. The ministers then have this peculiar to
themselves: howbeit all of us in common must sow to eternal life, that is to
say, we must pass through this world as strangers, lifting up our minds to
the heritage where we should rest, and whereunto also it behooves us to apply
all our indeuer. And even when we travel for the sustenance of our bodies,
let it be always with tending to the said mark, according as it is said that
we must not live to eat (...) but eat and drink to the end to be conveyed to
another life: and that our living in this world is not to settle here, but to
atteyne to a higher thing, that is to say, to the heavenly life. Since it is so,
whenever any man buzieth himself to get his living, whither it be by
tillage, or by some handicraft, or by trade of merchandise, or howsoever it
be, in all the cares that we take for ourselves or for our housholdes, let us
always shoot at a higher mark. For surely it is a naughty thing, if a man
buzie himself but only about the getting of his living, and have no regard of
Gods service. For in the getting of his living he ought too consider thus with
himself: How will God allow of my dooyng? How will he accept my service?
Truly that will he do if I walk not after mine own lusts, if I look that I
do no man wrong, and if I buzie my self faithfully about the thing that I am
bound too do. This (I say) is the way for us too sow: that is too wit, that
we be not wedded to the world, nor hilde down here beneathe, but that we
may always mount upward too the life of heaven. Now then let us look well
upon the mean of sowing after that sort: that is to wit, of sowing too the
spirit, says Saint Paul. Wherefore let us consider that we be not as
Asses and Oxen that toil and labor, and afterward do eat and drink, and
are fed as reason and good right require: but that God has adopted us too come
to the life of heaven. Therefore let us sow to the spirit; and cut off all
that may hinder our mounting upward, let us shake them off as hurtful things,
and assure our selves that al such as labor to get reputation in this world,
shall in the end find themselves disappointed. Why so? For they shall see
plainly that it is but corruption. When he that shall have gathered great
abundance of goods comes unto death, he has so much the more greef, because
he made this world his paradise. Therefore he then gnasheth his teeth at God,
and he stormeth and tormenteth himself, much more than if he had not taken so
much peynes to gather. Thus ye see that such as have sowed in the flesh,
perceive [at length] that they have sowed to corruption, because they gather
nothing else but corruption: but it is all to late, and therefore let us bethink
ourselves. And although we (...) men beguile thems^^^s, and too make their
reckening that it is a happy life to have all thing that they wish, as
commonly every man is ruled by his own lyking: although we see men storm
after that fashion: let us learn to do otherwise and consider that God calls
us to an everlasting life, which he sets continually before us by his
Gospel. Let us set our whole minds upon that, and let al our intents and
desires tend thitherward, and let us indeuer to profit more and more in the
doctrine of salvation, that he may lift us up and draw us hence from beneath,
Ephesians. 6. c. 15
according also as S. Paul says when he tells us what the weapons of
Christenfolke are, making the doctrine of the Gospel to be our shoes. For it
stands us on hand to be armed from top too toe, or else we should soon be
wounded with the assaults that are given unto us in this world. After he has
declared this (say I) he says that the Gospel must lift us up, and draw us
from the corruptions wherein we be plunged, so as we may atteine too the
kingdom of God whereunto he calls us. Ye see the^ what we have to bear in
mind. Now as touching that S. Paul says, that they which have sowed in the
spirit shall reap everlasting life: he means not that we in so doing
deserve so worthy and excellent a thing as the kingdom of heaven is: but he
shows that the faithful having known their own calling, shall never find
themselves deceived, though they seem wretched too the worldward. We know
that God adopteth us of his own free goodness: that is the groundworke of our
salvation. He forgyueth us our sins: and that is our ryghtuousnesse. For if
he should consider us in our own nature, he could not but cast us away as
loathsome and accursed: So can we find no grace at his hand, except he
admit us of his own free goodness. And we know also that our works are
evermore imperfect and blemished with some vice, so as they cannot be accepted
of God. We are sure that when we should go about too serve him and to do
good, oftentimes we go clean backward, so that we are evermore in his
danger. But howsoever the world go, when God has once adopted us to be his
children, buried all our sins, and showed that he lyketh well of our service
though it be imperfect: then declares he further and adds as an overplus,
that we shall not be de^^^ed in dedicating our (...) unto him, and in laboring
for the heavenly life. It is true that men will laugh us to scorn. Behold
these fondlings say they: see how they martyr themselves? And wherefore? for the
kingdom of heaven. And who has brought them tidings of that? It is I wot not
what a kind of Religion that beguileth these folk, and in the mean while
they be poor outcastes, in whom there is neither courage nor any thing else.
According whereuntoo we see now adays, that such as stand upon their
reputation, do rail upon us saying: as for these wretched silly souls what
think they to do? Lo how we be scoffed at, because we covet not too
advance ourselves nor too be in reputation of the world. Although then that
we be so scorned, let us give ear too the promise that is made us here:
which is that if we follow our vocation simply, we shall perceive that God
who has begone is faithful, and that his intent of winning us unto him is
our souereyne welfare, and that he not only seeks our profit in all respects:
but also will through his infinite goodness show himself a father and
Savior toward us. Wherefore let us streyne our selves too the uttermost too
come unto him, let us dedicate ourselves wholly to him, and let us give over
all worldly things that may hinder our coming unto him, I say let us give them
all quite and clean over, seeking continually the things that may guide us
upward, and let us continue in them to the end. And if we do so: surely our
Lord Jesus Christ will show that there is a harvest prepared for us, not of
these worldly riches which are subject to corruption (for the costlyest and
richest apparel and deckings of this world shall be eaten with mothes and worms:
and there is neither gold nor silver nor any thing else, but it perishes in
the end. And moreover when me^ will needs take of the^ vnmeasurably: they shall
burst with the goods which they have heaped together, and they shall not only
become unprofitable to the^, but also they shall turn to their utter
destruction. In sted of this the^, we shall find that we have hoorded up a good
treasure, which shall be laid up safe for us in the hand of God, to receive the
fruit of it when we shall have finished our course in this world, and
continued the sowing of our seed, that is to say, when we shall have
proceeded in the (...) of our God without weariness, looking always up to
heauenwarde, and withdrawing ourselves from the world as much as is possible
for us.

And now let us cast down our selves before the Majesty of our good God with
acknowledgement of our sins, praying him too make us so too feel them, as it
may bring us too true repentance, and yet notwithstanding we not cease too
comfort and cheer up our selves with his goodness, not doubting but that he
receives us too mercy, at leastwise if we repair too him too be reformed
by his holy spirit, till he have rid us quite and clean of all the
imperfections and vices of our flesh, and renewed us after his own image, to
bring us to the perfect righteousness wherevntoo we travel. And so let us all
say, Almighty God heavenly father. etc.

The. 41. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the sixth Chapter.
9 Let us not be vveerie of well dooyng: for in convenient season we shall
reap without weariness.

10 Therefore while we have time let us do good too al men, but chiefly to
them that are of the household of faith.

11 Ye see how large a letter I have written too you with mine own hand.


We have seen the similitude whereby Saint Paul exhorted us to do good, so
long as God gives us time in this world. For while we be here, we ought to
apply all Gods gifts too the service of him and of all his, yea and generally
of all men. For after as God bestows any ability or gift upon any (...) us
he byndeth him too such as have need of him and as he is able too help.
Therefore we must be fully resolved of this, that none of us must be idle or
unprofitable, but have an eye too the mean that God has given us, too the
end that every of us may make as it were a sacrifice of it unto him. And
herevppon, too give us the better courage, Saint Paul says that in so dooyng
we do sow: and God will not suffer us too be disappoynted, when we shall
have indeuered too occupy our selves about the things that he commands.
We are of opinion that all is lost, if every man seek not his own profit,
and be given wholly too himself. But it is clean contrary. For although
that he which succoureth his neyghbor forgo the thing that he bestows upon
him: yet he puts it in good keepyng, as he does which lays his seed intoo
the ground, that is, to reap fruit of it in convenient season. Contrariwise
there is a way for all to perish: namely if we be too gripple of the riches of
this world, so as we have no care nor regard but of our own profit: we
shall gather corruption, that is too say, all shall perish, as in very deed
the world and the fashion thereof must needs pass and vanishe away. Thus
ye see what all the treasure is which they can scrape together, that indeuer
too make their hand in this world. For as their life is flyghtfull and
transitory, so are all the goods that they shall have hoorded up, and all
shall go too destruction. But if we can discharge our selves of earthly cares,
and look up too the kingdom of God, although we seem too be diminished and
made poor by dooyng good: yet shall not our treasure perish, but shall be well
kept in Gods hand till the last day. Howbeit for as much as the Devil
offers us many occasions too cool us, or too make us turn head back
ageine, Saint Paul adds a very needful incoragement, which is, that we
should not be weerie of well dooyng. And afterward he adds that we must
be patient, in waiting for the seasonable time of gathering. Therefore where
as he says that we must not be weerye, it is because that such as have
any good will or desire too do good, shall be plucked back by Satan's (...),
and by a numbe^^ (...) comberances and lettes which he will cast in their way.
If a man walk abroad for his own pleasure, he needs not too be warned
that he weary not himself. And why? For he chozeth some fair beaten path, he
keeps a measurable pace, and he goes at his ease: for he is not stinted to
go thus many leagues in a day, but returns ageine as soon as his journey is
not to his mind.

This warning therefore is for such as have long iourneys to go, and not only
one or two, but continual trauelings. They shall perchance have hard
passages, they shall have stony and shrubbie ways, or ways that are myrie
and dirtie, they shall have hills and dales. Such have need too be quickened
forward, that they may be cheered and pluck up a good heart, that they tire
not nor quayle not in the mids of their journey. Even so is it with us when
God touches us with his holy spirit, so as we be disposed to serve him and to
do good to such as seek succor at our hand. But on the one side we be
plucked back by unbelief, because we be afraid that the earth will fail
us: and if any manne be too be relieved, we cast with our selves that the
like want and penury may befall our selves. Thus ye see we be plucked
back, we be snarled in that ouercarefulnesse, and are insatiable in our
lusts, and think we shall never have enough. Herevppon also we be tempted
too seek excuces. For we will allege [on the one side] that we cannot tell
whither the party that complayneth have such need as he speaks of, or
whither he be so greatly too be pitied: and on the othersyde that the world
is so wicked and ungracious, that a man cannot tell too whom too do good, and
that oftentimes the good turn is lost, and there is such unthankfulness,
that it were better too let those complaynants to endure hunger and thirst,
than to give them occasion too offend God, in beguyling men after that sort
and in laughing them too scorn for their labor. There will always be found
excuces and shifts ynow too escape from weldooyng, as experience shows too
much, specially considering that we be so lazy and faint by nature. So
much the more therefore does it stand us in hand too remember this lesson
which Saint Paul sets down ^^^ere, which is, too (...) still without
being weerie, yea verily in dooyng good. This matter concerns the enlarging
of our hearts, and of the employing of our goods (if we have any) to the
relief of our needy neyghbors. And we know that Saint Paul has begone at
the ministers of Gods word. Nevertheless he exhorts us all generally, for
so much as God has knit us all together, and set us in the world with
condition that every of us should consider wherein he may be able too help
such as have need of him. Let us apply our life thervntoo, that we pervert
not the order of nature. Furthermore for as much as we be so lither and
cold, and shall also find many occasions too hinder and break off the zeal
that we have too discharge our duty. Let us ouerleape all incomberances, and
pluck up a good heart that we quayle not. And the more that the world is
now adays come too the top of inquitie, unthankfulness, and malice: the more
doothe it stand us in hand too tread down such temptations, rather having
an eye unto GOD, than to the unworthiness of the persons that are too be
succored. For how much lewdness soever there be throughout the whole
world: yet will God continue always unchangeable in his purp^se: that is too
wit, he will have every of us to consider his own ability, and the measure
that is given unto him, and that we be not borne too ourselves, (for God has
not created us to that intent) but he will have every of us to thrust forth and
as it were too constreine himself to help such as desire succor of him: and
although they crave it not, yet if we see them in necessity, he will have us
too relieve them by such means as he offers. The very heathen men had
skill enough too speak such language. Therefore it is dubble shame too us if
we know not wherefore God has created us, and wherefore he shows himself
so bountiful toward us. Truly he could well have disposed the world in
such wise, as no man should have wanted, and every man might have forborne
other. But he offers us matter of pity and compassion, too show whither
there be any kyndhartednesse in us or no. Now we must also mark well the
promise that Saint Paul adds: which is, (...) we shall reap or gat^^^ in
seasonable time. True it is that we were not too be excused, though there
were no reward at all, but that God should say simply that he will have it
so^^ for it is sufficient that he has set us in the world, and fed us with his
bounteousnesse, and it requires at leastwise that we should be wholly at
his commandment: howbeit for as much as he sees our feebleness and
slowenesse, he adds this ouermore too make us pluck up a better heart,
saying, that none of all our doings shall be lost. For he does as it were
take them intoo his keepyng, and will deliver us them again, yea even with a
greater profit than we could have hoped or wished for in the world. He that
has money in his powche, and sees a commodity offered him, will lay it out
on all sides: for he presupposes that he shall loze nothing by it, but that
besides the return of the principal, he shall be much increased by the
profit that will rise to him of it. Truly if a man be about to lend money,
or too put it too some traffike, he will look twyce or thrice too it that it
may be sure: but finally if he spy a rich man that is able too pay and of
good credit: he concludes by and by that he may well trust him. But though
God assure us as much as may be that whatsoever we put intoo his hands shall
return safe unto us, and that we shall have greater gain of it, than of all
the things that we can do in the world: he has not so much credit among us
that we will trust too his word: no, we be deaf on that side. First of
all therefore, Math. 10. d 42.
too the end we should not be thrust out of the way by meannes unkindness:
our Lord says, whatsoever ye do too the least, or to the most despised of
these, I accept it and acknowledge it as done to my self. Too be short I
receive it as of mine own hand. Lo how God speaks as in respect of the word
profit. Also he adds a promise, that there is no usury nor gain so great,
as the profit that is to be hoped for at his hand, so we shet our eyes against
worldly things, that they hold us not back, but bestow the things that he
has put intoo our hands, and which he has committed to our charge, as he
appoynteth by his word. But whereas God speaks after that manner, not once
or twyce but many times, so as if there were but one drop of trust in us,
surely we should be fully resolu^^^ ^f it: yet notwithstanding ^^^swade we
be still fastened here bylowe, and cannot believe nor persuade ourselves,
that God speaks in good earnest.

Therefore it is not without cause that S. Paul sets down the promise,
that we shall gather or reap, as if he had said, ye wretched men, ye
stand upon thorns when any profit is showed you, and although the issue be
uncertain, yet your covetousness drives you to it, and every of you is
willing to disburse your money. Lo here, God which is true and can not lie,
assures us oftentimes, yea and warranteth us that whatsoever we put into his
hand shall yield us inestimable gain: and yet we can not find in our
hearts to believe him for all his promises which he makes unto us. And can we
do him a greater wrong? He for his own part owes us nothing: whatsoever he
promises us, is of his own good will without being in any wise bound unto
us, and yet can not any thing induce us to serve him. Therefore mark well what
Saint Paul tells us, to the end that every of us may indeuer too amend
this cursed root of covetousness, which is so deeply settled in our hearts,
that we must be feign to enforce our selves when we should follow whither
so ever God calls us, and specially when we should play the faithful
Stewards in dealing forth the goods which he has put us in trust with. How be
it, let us mark the words which he adds, in convenient season, says he. And
this serves to confirm and strengthen us in patience. For we would have God
to show us to day or to morrow, or rather out of hand, what the profit is
that he speaks of. The husbandman will hold him self quiet when he has
laid his seed in the ground. Afterward he sees frost and snow, wind and
rain, heat and cold: and yet nevertheless he wayteth still for the coming
of harvest. They that occupy the trade of marchaundise, put forth their
money, yea and their own persons also in great danger: and in the mean while
their silver goes and runs, and is shifted too and fro: and yet
notwithstanding because they be accustomed to buying and selling, they know
well enough that they shall not receive any profit at the first day, but must
be feign to wait till the time come. Howebeeit there (...) hoping or looking
fo^^^^ present gain when we have to (...) with God, and yet notwithstanding
we must think our selves out of all doubt of it, in so much that the time
ought not too seem too long, if we look up to the euerlastingnesse of the
kingdom of heaven* and yet for all this, no man is pacient. We will be quiet
enough so long as we hazard and adventure our goods: and is it not a very
pitiful case, that when as God tells us that he will be a faithful keeper
of the things that are too be spent [in his seruice] we fall into sorrow and
unquietness, and bear our selves in hand that all is lost, if we see not
the thing performed out of hand? Ye see then that the thing which we have
to mark upon this saying, is that we must bridle our selves till the
convenient time be come. For it is not for us to appoynte the certain day:
that must remain in the hand of God. Therefore let us be contented that he
exercise our patience, and the time shall not be prolonged further than is for
our profit. Furthermore S. Paul meant also to draw us from the world, for we
desire temporal profit. No doubt but we will be well contented that God
should give us it: but yet therein we show our selves too be altogether
earthly. For if a man do any almose deeds, although his intent be too serve
God: yet could he find in his heart too receive by and by for every penny a
shilling, or rather a Crown, and under color of doing some small almose
deeds, he would seek too rake into him self on every side. For as much
then as we would chaffer so with God: Saint Paul to correct such vice,
says that we must look whether God calls us, that is too wit, too the
great day, at the which every man shall have his wages. So then although all
seem to be lost as in respect of this world, and of this present life, yet
let us not cease too trust still in God, who is a faithful keeper of our
pawnes and gages, and will do much more for us than we can hope for, so that
we on our side have patience. Heerevppon he concludes, that while we have
time and leisure, we must do good too all men, and specially to the household
of faith. Now in saying that we must labor to do good while we have
leisure: he sets before us the shortness of our life. And we see an
ungracious malady still in us in that behalf: for every day seems as a
ye^^^ too us. Will there (...) be no end, say we? Must we still continue
in this plight? (...) we ever be new to begin? Lo how every of us
thinks the time to be ouerlong that is spent in well doing. And thereupon,
O (say we) I shall come soon inoughe: for if I spend my self to day, and
one come to crave of me to morrow, I shall want wherewith, and therefore I
were better to spare my self. Now these delays are such as a man shall
never find time to do good. For every man would prefer his fellow before
him, not of purpose to follow him in doing good, but to hold him self still
at a stay. But contrariwyse Saint Paul tells us, that if we consider the
matter advisedly as it is in deed, we shall find our selves too have no great
leisure of all the time of our life. For although we did never cease, but
every man enforced him self as much as were possible, too spend him self in
the serving of his neighbors: yet were it never a whit too much. We see
that as long as we be in this world, we must still be in charge. We see
we must be fed and clothed while we be children, at which time we can
not earne the value of a pin, and other folks must be feign too travel for
us. Very well: are we come too years of discretion? Yet have we need too
be oftentimes helped and succored, I mean even the rychest sort of us. For
there will come some sickness, or other adversity, that shall pull down them
which think them selves too be lustyest and strongest. Again we shall have
need of so many things and be so combered for our own selves, as we shall
scarsly be able too imparte the hundredth part of our duty, too those whom
we owe it too by Gods appointment. They (I say) which are rich and have
store of goods, even they having also a good will, (do what they can, and
travel they never so much without ceassing) shall hardly or never be able too
discharge the hundredth part of their duty toward those whom they be
bound unto. Therefore when all is well considered, we shall find that we
have no great leisure too do good too our neighbors. For when we come too
old age, it is a returning again too a second childehoode, so as we serve
too no more purpose than little babes, saving that (...) be more chargeable,
byc^^^^ we be waywarde and uneasy too content: every body must be combered
with doing service to us, and when all is done, we be utterly unprofitable.
Hereby then we see that we have no great leisure to do well: and therefore
it behooves us too streyne our selves so much the more, while God gives us
convenient time. When a husbandman sees fair wether, Ply it sirs, ply it
(says he) we can not tell whither it will rain or no: we must go dig our
vynes, we must go till our ground, we must sow our seed, we must do one
thing or other while the wether serves, for we can not tell how long it will
last. Likewise does the marchantman when he has a vyage too make, and
likewise do all other men. And now comes that travel or labor in question
which God calls us too. The case concerns sowing, yea even to the spirit,
and to the incorruptible life: and yet for all that we say we be none of the
hastings: we may well delay it yet a year hence, yea two or three years
hence, that is too say, from henceforth for evermore: such is our negligence
and coldness. Therefore let us learn too practice this warning that is given
us here by the holy Ghost: namely too do well while we have leisure, for we
shall not have it ever. And it is a special favor that God grants us, when
he puts into our hands wherewith to succor our neybours. And in so doing
he gives us some token before hand that he auoweth us for his children, and if
we can find in our hearts to impart his gifts to such as have need of them,
it is a mark of his image that he puts into us. Now then if we be
willing to serve their turns which crave our help, when we have means
wherewith, and opportunity to do it: surely God does us great honor in it.
And we wot not whether that leisure shall last with us still or no: For we
see how he plucketh away his goods from these Cormorants, and from such as are
like Seagulfes: we see how he strippeth them miserably, so as they be driven
to seek succor themselves, and are not regarded, because they have bin so
full of cruelty, that they had no compassion upon such as sought their
relief. Seeing it is so then: Let us mark that our life is but short, and
passes away swiftly, and that occa^^^^s of weldoing slip away (...) And
therefore let us ply it according as our Lord gives us (...), yea even
toward all men (says S. Paul) but chiefly toward the household of faith.
Now when he says too all men, it is to show us that although men discourage
us to do them good, yet we must not cease to do still as God commands us.
For (as I have touched already) we must not look what every man is, nor what
he deserves: but we must mount up higher and consider that God has set us in
this world too the end we should be united and knit together: and that for
as much as he has imprinted his image in us, and we have all one common
nature: the same ought too move us too succor one another. For he that will
exempt him self from releeuing his neybours, must get him a new shape, and
show that he intends too be no more a man: for so long as we be of
mankind, we can not but behold our own face as it were in a glass, in the
person that is poor and despised, which is not able too hold out any longer,
but lies gronyng under his burden, yea though he were the furthest stranger
in the world. Let a Moore or a Barbarian come among us, and yet in as much as
he is a man, he brings with him a looking glass, wherein we may see that he
is our brother and neighbor. For we can not abolishe the order of nature,
which God has set to be inviolable. So then we be bound too all men
without difference, because we be all one flesh, as the Prophet Esaias auoweth,
saying: Es. 58. b. 7
Thou shall not despise thine own flesh. As if he should say, they that are
nigardly and pinching, and shrink away when they should do good, do not
only despise God, and reject his word: but also are ugly monsters, because
they consider not that there ought too be a community among all men. Thus ye
see why S. Paul says expressly, that we must indeuer to do good to all men,
yea even to such as are unworthy, even though they were our deadly enemies.
Truly this is hard, and contrary to our inclination: but yet therein God
tries us so much the better. For if we do good to such as deserve it, or
to such as are able to recompense it: it is no declaration or proof that we
be willing to serve God: Mat. 5. g. 46.
for it may be that we had respect to our own ^^ofite. And as our Lord Jesus
Christ tells us, the Heathen men, and the worst men in the world do as much
as that comes too. How so? They consider with them selves, I have need of
help, I must win me some freende. Then if we snole out such as are worthy
to have good done unto them, and such as are able to requite like for like: it
is no right proof nor certain trial that we be willing to employ our selves
as God commands us. But when we wink at men's unthankfulness, and are
inclined to pity, only in respect of their poverty and misery: then do we
surely serve God. And if we be once at that point, certaynely (as I told you
before) we shall indeuer too do good to all men, so as we can not find in
our hearts to break the indissoluble bond whereby God has knit and united us
together. Therefore the furthest strangers in the world are neighbors near
enough unto us, though they be neither our parents, our kinsfolk, nor our
acquayntaunce. And why? For we be all of one flesh, and we bear all one
mark, which ought too persuade us too do what we can possible one for
another. But how soever the case stand, Saint Paul commends unto us
chiefly the household folk of faith. And he uses the word Household folk,
too touch us more to the quick by that similitude. For although nature teach
us that we ought too succor such as are in necessity* yet notwithstanding
they that are of one household are more inclined and willing to do good one to
another. Ye see here what degrees are among men, how all know that there is
a certain mutual bond, so as if they forsake even the furthest strangers of
the world, therein they forget them selves: yet notwithstanding forasmuch as
it is hard for a man to reach out him self so far and wide: therefore men
are not so much inclined to do good to unknown persons, except it be in
extreme necessity. For then how hard hearted so ever we be, every of us is
moved to put to his helping hand to succor a man, when we see him in imminent
danger. Yea and this pitifulness is so engraven in us, that it will extend
it self even to the brute beasts: and therefore much more reason it is that
it should extend to those that are created after Gods image as well as our
selves. But as I said, if a man be in extreme necessity, then are we (...)
more earnest to help (...) need. And when we be of one country and
language, then we see our selves somewhat nearer one another, and that
increases the affection which otherwise in general would be but cold. But
when there befalls any freendlynesse and familiarity of neiborhood, that is
yet more: according as we see that they which be of one Country will say,
Seeing that God has brought us thus near together, let us at leastwise
indeuer too serve one another turn. Again we see that the neighbors which
dwell in one self same street, and communicate familiarly together, are as
kinsfolk and near of alyance. Now then it is much more reason that they
which are all of one house, and are gathered as it were into one little
corporation or body, should be hilde as it were fast linked together by
God: and that he should embrace them as if a father should hold all his
children about him. For as much then as we ought too be so much the more
moved too employ our selves with the better courage, seeing that God has so
knitte us together, and brought us so familiarly near one another: Saint
Paul says that all the faithful, and all those that profess the same
Gospel which we do, are as household folk of one self same house. 1. Tim.
3. ^. 15.
And in very deed the Church is called Gods house, and he sits over in the
midst of us. When the Scripture speaks so, it means not that our uniting
together must be in such a material Church or Temple as this is: but that
although every man be at home in his own house, yet God has in such wife
gathered us together too him self, that we be as it were household fellows
one with another, and we be not only Countrymen of one Realm or kingdom,
but there is yet a certain nearer alyance, which ought to hold us more
close together. Too be short, when as it is said that such as intend too
be Gods children must dwell all together in one house: it is too show that
there is as it were one common brotherhood among us. And although earthly
brethren go asunder one from another, and every man gettes him away by him
self: yet must we always continue in the unity which God has set among
us. Sith we here this, must we not (...) be worsse than (...), and
crueller than the brute and wild beasts, if we be not moved too bestow
Gods gifts too the relief of our neighbors, I mean of the faithful?

Now then we see that Saint Paul's meaning in effect is, that seeing God
has bound us too do good too all men, because they be our own flesh: no
malice ought too hinder any of us from indeuering too discharge him self
generally toward all such as God offers too him, and in whom it is his
will too try our kindness. And yet notwithstanding that for as much as he
has gathered us into his flock, and knit us together in his name, and we
call upon him as our father with one mouth: it behooves us of duty too be
as brothers one too another. So that if we mind that he should allow us for
his children, we must so advance the adoption whereby he has chosen us, as
we may declare unfeignedly by our doings, that we mind too show that we
take them for our brothers, whom God has so gathered into his house and
Church. Thus ye see what we have too remember upon this Text. Wherefore let
us no more use these fond excuses too say, I wot not who he is, I know him
not. But he is not known of God? yes: and yet notwithstanding thou disdaynest
too open thine eyes to look upon him that is thine own image, yea and whom
God takes for one of his children. Thou know not him, and yet behold how
God voutsafeth to cast his eye upon us which are most miserable, yea even he
which has so high and terrible a majesty, that the very Angels of heaven do
tremble before him with all humility. Ye see then that God our sovereign
Lord looks down upon us that are but wretched worms of the earth and
filthiness: yea and he not only voutsafeth to say, I know you: but also
protests, I have adopted you for my children, ye be my workmanship, ye be
mine heirs, ye be after a sort my members. God voutsafeth too speak after
that fashion: and we be so full of pride and statelynesse, that we despise
such as are as good as our selves, and most commonly much better. So then
who can bear with such pride? To be short, they that are so strange in
withdrawing them selves from their brethren, and will not in any wise
communicate with them, deserve well to be wiped out of the boo^ ^f life, so as
God should ^we and scrape them quite out, and deliver them into the possession
of the Devil who is their sire, for he was a murderer and full of cruelty
from the beginning. Thus ye see in effect what we have too bear in mind,
and how it behooves us too practice this lesson, wherein the household folk of
faith are chiefly commended unto us. And so, seeing that God has vouchsafed
too call us too him, let us show our selves too set more by that grace and
honor, than by all the goods in the world. And in proof thereof, let us
show also that we have a brotherly affection too do good too such as have
need of us, according to such opportunity as God shall give us, and according
too the measure of our ability. Now herevppon Saint Paul says, that the
Galathians ought too consider, that he has written them a large letter with
his own hand. And this serves too make them the more attentive, when they see
what care he has of their salvation. For his commending of the largeness of
his letter, was not too be paid for it by the pound (as they say) but too
the end that the Galathians might know, that he meant too open his heart unto
them, and that for as much as he saw them thrust out of the way into a wrong
trade, and was loathe that they should perish, therefore he had not only warned
them in a word or twain, but also confirmed his doctrine, so as they might
perceive themselves to have bin misledde before. Lo in effect whereat Saint
Paul amed. And by this text we ought all to take warning, to confirm our
selves the more, according too the means and helps which our Lord gives us
to come to him withal. If God had but incled his mind unto us in one word,
yet had there bin no excuce for us if we could not believe him, to submit our
selves with such obedience as becomes us. But when we see that besides his
giving of the Law, he has also added an exposition of it, and moreover sent
his Prophets too the end that the doctrine should always be of the more
authority, and the things be made clear which else would have bin darkesome:
and after his Prophets, sent his only Son who has brought us the full
perfection of all wisdom: and finally his Apostles: so that he thought it not
enough too give the Law, but also willed the Gospel too be published, and
that the same should continue to the end, and stirs fit men still to
instruct us: since (...) (I say) that God does so much for us, and that he has
such a care of our welfare, quickening us up continually without end or
ceassing: must we not needs be so much the more blameworthie, if we be
negligent and all this stand us in no stead? Therefore let us not look at
Saint Paul here, how the Galathians had little regard of him: but let us
consider that God had raised him up, and meant too show how dear we be unto
him, and how great store he sets by our souls, in that he would have his
doctrine so confirmed. True it is that there are not past a six or seven
leaves in this Epistle, and at the first, it should not seem to be so great a
letter. But if we mark the substance and contents of it, surely we shall
find here wherewith to confound the Devil, and all the wyles that he can
bring with him, so as Gods truth (which is our salvation) shall have the upper
hand. In so much that if we had no more but this Epistle, we might be
[sufficiently] fenced and armed, to fight against all the lies, deceytes and
abuses which the Devil can allege to bleare our eyes with. But we have not
this Epistle alone: but we have also so many other of Gods testimonies, as are
sufficient (as ye would say) to put out our eyes, if we list not to look upon
them. And therwithall we have so many confirmations to help us: that although
we were the stubbornest and wildest creatures in the world, yet might we be
drawn too some knowledge, seeing that God tries so many ways to win us to
him. To be short, he makes us too come unto him though we would not come by
our good will. And if we go back whereas we should come forward: must not the
rebelliousnesse that is in us be tootoo intolerable? So then, whenever and
as often as we read this text, although it seem not to touch us, but too have
bin spoken only to the Galathians: yet let us understand that god casts us in
the teeth, that his labor should be lost as vnauaylable among us, except we
were furthered continually by the doctrine more and more confirmed. Howbeit he
had much lever that we came with a cheerful courage. For he intends not to
blame us nor too go to law with us, co^dicionally that we be so well aduized as
to say, Go too, I see now that my God deserves well that I should hie me to
him, if he did but becken too me a far off. But he calls me wondrous
familiarly, and is no^ ^^^tented with opening his mouth once for all and away:
but he has also sent Moses and all the ^^^phetes, he has sent teachers
without number, he has sent his Apostles, yea and his own only son which is
his everlasting wisdom and word. Seeing then that God is so friendly to me,
yea and aduaunceth me to excellent dignity, and seeing that by all means
possible he shows me his wisdom, whereby he seeks to win me to himself,
and continues in the same without end or ceassing, early and late: should I
lie still as asleep, without any more understanding or feeling than if I were a
block? So much the more then does it stand us on hand to take a better taste of
Gods word, and to apply all our indeuer thereunto. And seeing there is nothing
superfluous in it, and that we have need to be provoked to give ourselves to
it: Let every of us be moved too apply our selves thereto, and not say that the
repeating of one selfsame thing is needless: but let us understand, that
although men bring us no novelty, yet must we continually beat upon the
selfsame lesson: namely that in as much as God has sent Moses, the Prophets
and Apostles, and ouermore vouchsafed to have his doctrine put in writing: all
this was done for our instruction: and that when our Lord Jesus Christ was sent
at the full time, he uttered all that is requisite for our salvation, and
moreover raised up men to be the instruments of his spirit, to show us his
will and too bring us the tidings of salvation, (as he does still at this day)
who are witnesses too us of the things which otherwise should have bin unknown
too us. For as much therefore as it is so: let every of us agree thereunto, and
whither we read it every man alone by himself, or whither we be taught it
publicly: let us be stablished in the word which it has pleased God too
bestow upon us. Thus ye see in effect what we have too bear in mind, too
the end we may have so much the greater good will too give our selves wholly
too this holy word, and that it may be received with the greater reverence,
according also as it is well worthy too be.

But now let us fall down before the Majesty of our good God and father,
acknowledging him as our judge except he bury our faults through his infinite
mercy, and let us pray him too take us to mercy for our Lord Jesus Christ's
sake, and in the mean while too grant us the grace too walk in such wise,
as we may ^^^de a true proof that we (...) his children, and that his calling
of us has not bin in vain: and also to cause the same grace too avail in
such wise in our hearts, that we may grow in it, and be strengthened more
and more too serve and worship him all our life long, in true obedience to his
holy word. And so let us all say, Almighty God heavenly father etc.

The. 42. Sermon, which is the fifth upon the sixth Chapter.
12 As many as desire with outvvard appearance to please in the flesh,
constreyne you too be circumcized, only to the end they may not suffer
persecution for the cross of Christ.

13 For even they themselves which are circumcized keep not the Law, but
vvoulde have you circumcyzed that they might glory in your flesh.


IT is not for naught that God has so often warned the Preachers of his
word, not too seek the well liking and favor of men, but as it were too
shet their eyes against all worldly respects, to the end that they gaze not
here and there, nor be hindered to do their duty rightly. For we see it is
impossible for us too discharge our selves aright, unless we look up unto
God, and turn away our look from men, because we shall be easly corrupted
when we be so led, whereas nothing ought too bow us one way or other.
Howbeeit, this constancy is chiefly requisite in such as should bear abroad
Gods word, namely that they be not led another by ambition nor by
covetousness too speak in favor of men, or too please them, and that they
be not abashed at any threatening or peril. For experience shows that so
soon as a man is afraid of his ^inne, or has respect of (...) own profit:
he will be changed in the turning of a hand. True it is that such as covet
men's favor after that fashion, will not at the first dash show themselves to
be wicked and enemies of the truth according as our Lord Jesus Christ also
puts a difference between the hyrelings and the woolues. John. 10. b. 12.
After he has spoken of the good and faithful sheepeherds which seek the
common welfare of the flock: he says, there are also ravening woolues or
thieves which seek nothing else but too put all too spoil, ruin, and
confuzion. And these are they which fight openly against God, laboring and
indeuering to overthrow the pure doctrine of the Gospel. Nevertheless there
are also which row between two streams, who do make a countenance to serve
God. And truly some men build, howbeit not for any zele: for there is no
soundness of heart in them. Notwithstanding, so long as it is not to their
cost, they set a good face upon the matter, so that the world is oftentimes
deceived by them, and takes them too be the ministers of Jesus Christ: but
yet their seeking is but for wages, they be wholly given too their bellies.
For proof whereof, if ye do but threaten them, by and by they be dismayed,
and they will turn the cat in the pan, so that whereas yesterday they seemed
too maynteyne Gods word, too day they bend crooked and a cross. And why? For
they see it is the way to please the world, and to profit themselves. And for
the same cause does Saint Paul now warned the Galathians to mark well, that
such as had troubled them and thruste them out of the right way, were men given
too their own profit, and by that means had brought their doctrine in
suspicion. Heretofore he has already sufficiently discussed and showed by
reason, that if we put our whole trust in Jesus Christ, the Ceremonies of the
Law are henceforth superfluous: for they served but for a time, too show that
it is not for us, too mingle any merit of their own, or any fond opinion of
purchacing righteousness before God, if we be well settled upon the grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ. Saint Paul then has handled and laid forth that
matter as much as needed. And now too the end that the simple sort may be the
more moved: he turns his ^ale too the persons themselves, saying: Consider
what is the (...) that these men against whom I strive here, make such a
minging of the Ceremonies of the law with our Lord Jesus Christ. Is it zele
that moves the^ thereunto? or is it for that they be desirous to serve God?
No: it is rather for that they be loathe too put themselves in danger of
persecution. Seeing then that fear causes the^ too misfashion Gods word: ye
need not too make any long inquiry too know what manner of men they be, and
whither they be to be credited or no: for ye see that their changing and
transforming of themselves after that fashyon, is because they would feign
shun the battle. Now then seeing that they be such traitors unto God
through their cowardlinesse, deserve they too be believed, or to have any
reverence yielded to their sayings? Thus ye see Saint Paul's meening. But
here all Ministers of Gods word are taught to have such constancy and
steadfastness, as they may not pass whither the doctrine that they bring be
hated or beloved of the world, but go on still in their race, and not strike
sail at every wind, nor be shaken like wavering reeds that bow too and fro:
but always hold on in serving of God, what turnings and chaunges so ever
happen, and what troubles and disorders so ever befall.

To be short, we must practice the thing that we have seen before: which is,
that if we will please men's fancies, we must give over the seruis of the
Son of God. Mark that for one point. And heerewithall also all the faithful
may receive a good and profitable lesson in this text: that is too wit, that
they must look well upon such as seek their own profit and advantage, and
are desirous to win favor with the world, and would feign be prayzed: for
a man shall never have any hold of such folk. They will not show themselves
too be such at the first brunt (as I said before): for there are that play the
Popeholy hypocrites, in so much that it seems that but for them the word of
God would grow odious: and so long as it is well lyked, they cast out fire at
their mouths, and yet in the mean while ye shall see them change their
mind from day too day. If any peril happen, and they see that they must
witness with our Lord Jesus Christ in good earnest: then show they their
cowardlinesse, and in the end turn quite away, and change their coats as it
is said in the Proverb. But howsoever they fare, let us sta^^ upon our guard
continually, that we may believe such as walk uprightly, and start not out
when they see the world co^federate themselves against them, no though there
happen such rage as it may oftentimes seem that they shall be swallowed up, but
which even when they see the perilles present, do nevertheless continue in
upright constancy: let us mark such men as Gods servants. But as for such as
be variable and counterfetting, which say now one thing and now another to
eschew men's hatred, or for fear of persecution: let us beware of them, that
we be not deceived and beguyled by them, for they be deadly plagues. And it is
certain that we shall never be firm and well settled, except we have that
discretion and warenesse with us, according as S. Paul shows us in this
text. And this is very needful now adays. For what causes so many
hypocrites too gabble against Gods word, and too play the shameless brothels
in maynteyning the outrageous abuses that are too be seen in the Popedom, as
their superstitions, idolatries, and errors: but for that they know well
enough, that if they make not the pot too boil apace, they are like too
starve, and should they not therefore hold fast the possession of their
things? Again on the other side they consider also the danger of persecution
for maynteyning such doctrine: for ye see it is condemned of the Princes and
great men of this world, and therefore it is good sleeping in a whole skin.
See I pray you how an infinite number do now adays disguyse and falsify
Gods truth, and maynteyne all corruptions, because they be loathe to suffer for
Jesus Christ's sake. True it is that they be not rank Papists too blaspheme
Gods word openly: but yet they would feign have a mean, yea of their own
devising. For they blame us of overmuch rigor and extremity, in that we
condemn such as go to Mass, and bear themselves in hand that they woorship
not ydols. O (say they), how should that be, so a man think it not in his
heart? Should men be driven so near hand as too make it a stumbling block,
and a matter of life and death? Too what purpose were that? God sets great
store by our life, and although we should do amiss, yet will he have pity
of our frayltie. Surely they that speak after (...) fashyon, have none other
reason too move them, but that they see plainly that all the world is so sore
inflamed against us, and it seems that we should perish and be quite
confounded every day. Thus ye see that they flee back and labor too imbattell
themselves alone from the rest, when they see any danger appeering. But when
we see these liuerharted folk shun persecution after that sort, and loath to
come to any hand strokes for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and winding and
transforming themselves after that manner, only to have peace in this world: it
stands us so much the more in hand too mark this warning of S. Paul's, and
to discern which are the true servants of Jesus Christ: that is too wit,
they which regard not their own profit, nor would have men too faune upon
them, nor seek the belly cheer and honor of the world: but do simply content
themselves with the doing of their duty, and pass not what wind do blow,
whither it be tempestuous and stormy, or whither it be fair and calm: but to
profit their heerers, and to maynteyne in all pureness the doctrine committed
unto the^. If we follow the thing that is showed us here, surely our faith
shall never stagger as many do now adays, which know not what to do, and yet
notwithstanding will say, I fear the troubles and diversities of opinions, and
the bickerings that are in this world. Some ca^ well enough say, it were meet
that I should give my self wholly to our Lord Jesus Christ: but there are
another sort which take a much pleasanter way, and would have a reformation
but only in half. And which of these shall I believe [say they Open thine
eyes: for all they that allege any such excuces, seek not too follow the
truth, but are well apayde if they can get some shrowding sheet too hide their
shame, and would feign be flattered: but in the mean while, what gain they
by it? For Satan leads them to destruction, and they be willing too follow
him. Because they are afraid of their lives, they love the covert, and because
they be given too pleasure, they seek their own ease. Therefore they must
have such payment as they deserve. But how soever the world go, S. Paul
declares that such as wilfully become brutishe, are so overtaken by Satan and
cast in such perplexity, as they wot not what too do: because they consider
not that such as do simply bear abroad the truth of the Gospel, are no
wavering person^^, but such as keep on (...) pace, and pass not whither the
world like of their doctrine or no^ but for as much as God has commanded them
to speak, they do so. Contrariwise, as for the nicelings which say it is good
too beware, and not to cast themselves out of the Saddle, and would have men
to counterfeyt, and to bear two faces in one whoode: it is certain that such
manner of men are not led with any zeal or affection to serve God, nor have
any regard of edifycation or of the welfare of the Church: nor (to be short)
have any other care or respect, than to eschew all persecution, and too live at
their ease, so as no man might fasten upon them. Now then, seeing that this
is manifest enough: it is certain that all such as nowadayes do keep
themselves so in their nest, do offend God, and are utterly without excuze.
Why so? For Saint Paul gives us here an infallible mark, which shows us
who be the true servants of God, and who be the hyrelings whom we must
eschew, that is too wit, such as seek but to feed their bellies, and too have
their commodityes in this world. Hereupon he adds, to the end they might
not suffer persecution for the Cross of Christ. No doubt but that under the
word Cross, Saint Paul comprehends the whole doctrine, howbeeit with a
consideration, that it is right hard for a man too preach simply and plainly
the things that are contained in Gods word, but that he shall have many
incounters. For although God spare us (us I mean which preach his word) and
will not always put us too so hard trial, that our enemies shall have their
swords drawn upon us: yet the world does never receive the Gospel so
obediently, but that there is still some murmuring and speaking against it, as
is too be seen yet still at this day, and must be yet hereafter. For our
Lord intends too try the constancy of his faithful ones, and therewithal
to show the invincible power of his word, in ouercomming all the lettes that
Satan styrreth up against it: Ier. 1. d. 19.
according too this saying of Jeremy, They shall fight against thee, but thou
shall get the upper hand of them. Thus ye see that God is glorified when the
world and Satan streining themselves to the uttermost, are not able too let the
truth of his course. For this cause Saint Paul says, that they which be so
variable, and do disguize Gods word or falsify it; do shun the Cross, that
is ^^^ay, the true preaching of the Gospel, even too eschew persecution. Now
here again we have a very profitable counsel. For if we desire to serve God
and his Church: we must always be ready to receive alarums. And although
the fire be not yet kindled, or the enemies not yet armed too make so cruel
persecution as they would, or finally our Lord do bridle all those that are
weary of his word, and would feign shake off his yoke: yet must we be
scorned at many men's hands, we must be diffamed, there must be murmuring and
railing against us, and we must put it up and harden our selves against it. Yea
and we shall see a thousand backbytings against such as employ themselves
faithfully, even where the Gospel is preached. Some shall be arreigned as
felons, and some shall be indicted of this and that, and yet all shall be but
stark slanders. To be short, all such as mind to go through with their race,
must prepare themselves too endure many temptations that might make them reele,
if they were not settled in this point, that God must be obeyed in spyte of
the whole world. Mark that for one point. And here withal we have also to
mark, that this extends to the whole Church in general. Therefore when we
here the message of peace that is brought us in the name of God: let us not
think to be in rest to the worldwarde, but too have many troubles and
incomberances continually. And he that determines not upon that must needs
shrink away from our Lord Jesus Christ: for he can never be any of his
disciples, Math. 10. d 38.
according as he himself declares with his own mouth, that such a man is not
worthy to be of his schole, and so he shetteth them all our of the doors.
Wherefore let us learn, that when we be once called to our Lord Jesus
Christ, we must be partakers of his cross so long as he lists, according as
it is said, that if we suffer with him we shall also be glorified with him,
To. 6. a. 5.
and be made partakers of the power that is showed in his Resurrection. But yet
notwithstanding the sufferings which he endured must first be accomplished in
us that are his members. True it is that he suffered as much as was requisite
for our salvation: but yet must we be fashioned like too his Image, as it is
said in the.viij. too the Romans. Now whereas God spares us, so as we be
not among Tyrants that might t^^ent us: or if the wicked ^ee not able too byte
us, but only bark at us: or if he let us (...) in peace: let us know that
it is because he pityeth our feebleness, and that he spares us because he
sees how weak we be. But yet for all this let us not flatter our selves,
but pray God too strengthen us so by his holy spirit, that whenever he
shall call us intoo the array too fight, we may not be like freshwater
souldyours, but that we may have minded it a long time before hand, that we
must be made partakers of Jesus Christ's sufferings, too come too the glory
of his Resurrection. Now Saint Paul having spoken after that manner, adds
for a larger confyrmation of his matter, that they which are circumcyzed, and
which preach circumcizion, keep not the Law: but only seek too glory in
the flesh of those whom they bring too that Iewishe fashion. In this Text
Saint Paul does ageine accuse his adversaries of double dealing and utter
hypocrisy. Why so? Circumcision was the mark of the same thing before the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, whereof Baptism is the mark unto us at
this day. For the Jews had record [thereby] that they were sanctified by God
as his heritage. But yet for all that, they that mingled Circumcizion with the
Gospel, were utterly of opinion that the Law of Moses was to be observed,
forasmuch as it was given of God, and that it was not at any time to be
abolished. Here then ye see that the covert which they took, was that
Circumcizion served for a sign of the keeping of the whole Law. But now S.
Paul lays to their charge that they keep not the Law: and therefore they do
but mock God and men in making a countenance by an outward sign, to do the
thing which they do not: for it is clean contrary. Now the^ we see S. Paul's
meening. And as touching this spech of keeping the Law, it is sometimes taken
for the doing or performing of all that is contained in the Law. But no man
can keep the Law, that is to say, no man can discharge himself thoroughly of
all things that the law commands. For it is not for naught that it is called
an intolerable burden. Also we see our own infirmity, Act. 15. b. 10
and there God shows us an angelical righteousness. How then is it possible
for us to attain unto it? So then, if we take the word Law for a perfect
and faultlesse obedience, no man keeps it in effect. Nevertheless the
fayth^^^ being guided and governed by Gods spirit, do keep the Law, that is
to say, they walk according to the rule that is given the^ there. Not that they
run so swiftly as they should do, nor that they attain to the mark at the
first brunt: but yet they go on still toward it, and God bears with them,
and lays not their faults too their charge. The faithful then do keep the
Law. But here S. Paul speaks of the Ceremonial Law, howbeeit that by
occasion he had showed heretofore, that all Gods commandments could bring
naught else but condemnation, except we had refuge to the grace of our lord
Jesus Christ: but (as I said) here he speaks of the ceremonies and shadows.
Now let us see what he means by it. They (says he) which are circumcized
keep not the Law: that is to say, they have in deed that sign as a
standarde too make men believe that they be Jews, to the intent that they
might not be hated nor persecuted: but yet for all that, they keep not the
whole Law: for they take leave to despize all that should be matched with
Circumcision. For he that is circumcized ought also to do sacrifize, too
absteyne from the meats that are forbidden by the law, to keep the days and
feasts appointed there, to use the enjoined washings and purifyings, and to do
diverse other things. But these men make none account of them. When they be in
corners and no man sees them, they pass not what they do, neither make they
any conscience at all to despize all the Ceremonies of the Law. Thus it
appears that they do it not for any zeal, but only in respect of men. Now
it behooves us to mark, that Saint Paul speaks here of such as stood upon
the said point, Act. 16. a. 3.
that men ought of necessity to be circumcized. 1. Co. 8. b. 6.
For at some times Saint Paul had a special regard to fashion himself like
to the Jews, and absteyned from the liberty which was permitted him, for
eschuing of offenses: but did he always mainteyne that there was no bond of
necessity in the matter. So then, when Saint Paul submitted himself of his
own accord, he meant not to bring other men in bondage, according as he
protests that he intends not to bind any body. True it is that the case
is altered when he speaks of marriage: but yet he says generally, 1. Co.
7. f. 35
that he will not lay any yoke of bondage upon the souls that are redeemed by
our Lord Jesus Christ: And thus ye see how Saint Paul behaved himself in
that behalf. Now (...) says here, They that constreyne you to be
circumcized, that is to say, they that lode you with the law, and say you must
keep that Ceremony under pain of deadly sin: seek nothing else but too
bring you in bondage without cause why. To be short, we see here whereof they
be blamed which would subdue Christen folk too the keeping of the Ceremonies
and shadows of Moses Law: that is to wit, that they were double fellows,
and passed not upon the truth of the matter, whither God required such things
or no, but had a mind to please and pleasure the world, and by that means to
eschew persecution. And we nowadayes have need to be warned thereof, as well
as the Galathians needed then. And if we look upon the state and disposition
of our time, we shall easily perceive that this doctrine is not needelesse, and
that the holy Ghost intended to provide for the thing which he knew to be for
our behoof. For what a number are to be found nowadayes, which do strongly
and stoutly mainteyne the Ceremonies of the Law, and yet notwithstanding make
none accounte of them? But (which is worse) they mainteyne the follies and
traditions that are invented by men, yea and even such abuses, errors, and
deceytes as are so gross and fond as may be. All these things shall be
mainteyned with extreme rygour, by such as will needs have men to obey them.
Like as nowadayes, if a man charge these Hypocrites that the grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and the brightness of his Gospel are darkened by the great
number of their observations, and that we be become as good as Jews: (for in
very deed the Papists have borrowed so many things of the Law, that a man shall
hardly discern the difference between the Jews, and them that call
themselves Christians:) I say if a man do charge them with these things: yet
will they mainteyne to the uttermost, that men must do so still, because they
have bin kept time out of mind. If a man go further with them, and say, how
so? Ye have so many dotages, that the very heathen men were never so gross
and fond in their superstitions as you be: O tush (say they) yet must we keep
still the traditions of our mother holy Church. And therewithal they cry, to
the fire with him. But now what do these Hypocrites, which move the (...) of
Princes and Judges against those that preach Gods word faithfully? So long as
they be among themselves, they make but a mock at their own traditions. And
when they dispute of them, they will say clean contrary too their preaching,
and talking in the Pulpit. Whereby it appears that there is no zeal of God,
nor no soundness in them: but that their whole seeking is to be fed and
pampered fat, and too live in rest, and too have their ease and commodities.
Seeing then that nowadayes there are so many men that have not one whitte of the
fear of God, nor of the reverence of his word in them, who notwithstanding
pretend too be very zealous, and yet in very deed do but allure poor
souls with baytes or rather (as ye would say) choke them: it stands us so
much the more on hand too mark well the thing that Saint Paul tells us
here: which is, that forasmuch as we see that they which cry out and storm
at others: do nothing at all of that which they speak of, we must stand upon
our guard, and consider whereat they ame which teach us. True it is that
although the party do clean contrary too that which he says, yet must
not Gods word therefore be of the less authority toward us: For it is no
reason that because the man is wicked, therefore God should be dispossessed
of his sovereign prerogative. And though a man lead a looce life, or do some
shrewde turn, yet ought not that to deface the heavenly doctrine, so he preach
faithfully. Although a man be mutable, fleeting and variable, or though he be
an hypocrite, and his life be not answerable to the things that he speaks
with his mouth: the truth of Gods word must not therefore be imbaced toward
us. Nevertheless, I say now that whenever we see men pretend great zeal,
and yet let themselves loce, and take leave to do contrary to their preaching:
we must consider of it, and have the discretion not too be led by their Pype
nor drawn by the noze, but to look into their doctrine, and to make a good
and lively trial of it. And when we go so to work, we shall see that the
doctrine of the Papists is but a covert which they take to live quiet to the
worldwarde, and as for to Godwarde they care not how things go. For they would
not abide any chau^ges, but that they be loath to put themselves in danger of
any displeasure: for they be always afraid to be vexed or grieved in any
wise. Since (...) this: it is an infallible mark to make us beware of all
Satan's ambushes, so as it shall not be possible for us to be deceived, except
we list our selves, as I have declared before. Furthermore, Saint Paul
adds, that such men desire to glory in the flesh of the simple. It is very
certain that here he has an eye to the sign of Circumcision, as if he
should say, they intend to prynt their mark upon you, to the end they may
vaunt, We have won them. Yea, but their winning of men after that sort, is
to make them so much the more detestable for so abusing the sign which God
has given them, to warrant the adoption which he had made with Abraham's
offspring, and for corrupting the true and lawful use thereof. For God had
commanded the Jews to be circumcised. And why? To the end they might see
that all mankind is accursed, and that there is nothing but uncleanness in us,
and that we must be feign to renounce all that is of our own nature, or else
we shall never cease too be filthy and damnable before God. Lo what the
Jews ought to have learned by their circumcizion. Nevertheless, therwithal
they had also a record, that by man's seed they should recover their salvation,
according as we know that we be blessed of God for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake.
And therefore Circumcision served too humble the Jews, and too make them
mislyke of themselves, and to be ashamed, when they saw there was nothing but
cursednesse in their nature. That say I was the true and lawful use of
circumcision. Now what do they against whom S. Paul speaks? They know that
Circumcizion is no longer in use: that is to wit, that Baptism suffizeth
ever since the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: but because the Jews called
all them Apostates or backsliders, which were not circumcized: therefore these
rascalles will needs hold still the sign without the truth [or substance.]
We see then that they were very falsaries, and wrested the doctrine clean
contrary too Gods meening when he ordained that spiritual Sacrament, because
their desire was nothing else but to please the world. As much is done at this
day. And they that labor to overthrow Gods truth, are much worse than Saint
Paul's adversaries. For they had yet some cloak of honesty mainteyne
Circumcizion and the figures of the Law, because they were al ordained and
stablished by God. But as for these hypocrites which cry out upon us nowadayes
with full throat, [saying] ye must keep the old custom without changing of
any thing: whereon are they grounded? They cannot say that God is Author of any
of their stuff. Men have contrived them after their own fancy, or rather
Satan has blown them into their ears: so that (at a word) all that is termed
Gods service in Popery, is nothing else but a confuzed maze: all is but
dreams of men's setting forth, and the devil is ever the chief Author of
them. And yet these naughtipacks say that nothing must be taken from them. And
whereunto have they respect? Truly they will allege that men must purchase
Gods grace by them, and that they stir folk up to greater devotion. Again,
they give the title of Sacrament too all the foolish devices of their own
heads, saying: such a thing must be kept, for it is a Sacrament. But when all
is justly reckened, a man shall see that their intent is to please the world,
and to mainteyne themselves still. For they be enforced spite of their teeth to
confess, that it makes neither here nor there as in respect of God, and that
he passes not for their kind of service, but utterly dislyketh it, because he
will be served with obedience. But what? There will be horrible confusion (say
they) if men cut off all after that fashion, and speak plainly of things. See
I pray you, how they would feign disguise themselves, and in such wise
corrupt and falsify religion, as there should be made a mingled confusion of
all: or else that there should no more be taken away but the grossest and
fondest things, and in the mean while such Ceremonies be let alone as may be
any whit sufferable. It is certain (say I) that all they which speak so,
desire nothing else but to have fair wind and weather to the worldwarde.
Seeing it is so: let us take warning at the holy Ghostes hand to flee such
plagues: And although we cannot triumph in this world, although we be nothing
set by, although men rail upon us with open mouth: yet let us not cease too
hold our own for Gods truth, and let it suffice us to be allowed of the
heavenly judge, though all the world abhor us. Although then that we see all
these things: yet let us be pacient, and tarry till our Lord Jesus Christ
show himself to be our warrant, and therewithal give (...) victory in the
behalf of his truth, so that all his enemies may be put to shame and have
they^ mouths stopped up.

Now let us fall down before the majesty of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him too touch us with such true
repentance by his holy spirit, that being utterly cast down in ourselves,
and quite and clean rid of all presumption, we may be heartily sorry for them:
and that moreover it may please him so to increase the gifts of his holy
spirit in us, as we may no more be given to our flesh, and the world to be
hindered and hilde down by them, but that we may go forward to serve him, and
indeuer that his name may be glorified more and more, and we bear such a
mark of his adoption, as we may be so confirmed with it in our selves, that
other men may have occasion to glorify the name of this our good God for
working so in us. That it may please him to grant this grace, not only to us,
but also to all people and nations of the earth. etc.

The. 43. Sermon, which is the sixth and last upon the sixth and last Chapter.
14 God forbid that ever I should glory [in any thing] saving in the Cross of
our Lord Jesus Christ, whereby the world is crvcified unto me, and I unto
the world.

15 For in Jesus Christ neither Circumcision nor Uncircumcision avails any
thing: but the new creature.

16 And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be upon them and
mercy, and upon Israel that perteyneth to God.

17 From henceforth let no man put me to pain, for I bear in my body the
marks of the Lord Jesus.

18 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.


WE have seen heretofore how Saint Paul condemned such as sought
altogether to row between two streams, thereby too please the world, and in
the mean while to eschew persecution: And that made them to disguise the
Gospel, whereof we see too many examples yet still at this day. For such as
see that the pure doctrine and truth of God can not be brucked of the world,
but that the wicked sort do rage against it: they (I say) would feign find
some mean way, that they might not be hated nor incur any displeasure. And
that it is so: if now a days ye ask it of such as have but some little
understanding: ye shall scarce find one of them among a hundred, which will
not grant that there are many abuses in Popery: but yet [they will say] that
all must not be cut off by the quick, but that it is inoughe if some of the
ouergrosse and excessive superstitions be taken away, and so they would feign
still nourishe a great sort of infections. And why? For (as I have said) they
would feign be in credit and estimation, and it is no matter at all with
them to betray the pureness of the Gospel, so they may save themselves from
persecution: yea and even among us a man shall find inowe that would have
both. And what moves them, but that they would advance them selves, and get
some reputation? Forasmuch then as we see that the Devil which raised those
broils in the time of Saint Paul, continues [the same] unto this day, we
ought to be armed with this doctrine. And the very remedy, is that which S.
Paul sets down here: namely to reject all glory, save that which we have
in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now for the better understanding
hereof, first of all we must call to mind how it is said in Jeremy, ^er.
9. f. 23.
and alleged also by S. Paul, that all the glory of man must be cast down,
too the end that God may be exalted as he deserves. Esa. 29. d. 14. and. 1.
Cor. 1 c. 19.
And in very deed it is truly said, that all the wisdom which men ween
them selves to have, is nothing, but must come to account and be quite da^^ed,
and they must resort (...) God, as to him that has the fullness of all good
things in himse^^ Let us confess (I say) that all wisdom proceeds of his
free goodness, inasmuche as we be enlightened by his holy spirit, and that
because we be weak of our selves, we must be strengthened by his power, and
whereas we be full of all filthe and iniquity, we must recover
righteousness by his gift. But now we must come to the means. For it is
not enough for us to know that God is our light, our righteousness, our
wisdom, our strength, and finally that the whole perfection [and fulnesse] of
our life, joy, and happiness is in him: that is not enough, for there is a
very far distance between him and us, and therefore it stands us in hand to
know how and by what means we may be partakers of all the graces which we
have to seek in God. Howbeit we know that the whole is communicated to us in
Jesus Christ, verily for that he came down here bilowe, and abaced him self,
and was contented to be crucified for us. Seeing then that our Lord Jesus
Christ is he out of who^ we must draw all things that we have need of: now
we see why S. Paul says he will not seek any glory but in the Cross of our
Lord Jesus Christ. And why? For in as much as he suffered so paynefull and
bitter a death, yea and was set against Gods justice for us, and took all our
cursednesse upon him: therefore was he given unto us to be our wisdom,
righteousness, holiness, strength, and all that ever we want. But first of
all we must learn what we be, to the intent to beat down all our own
glorying, and to settle our selves upon our Lord Jesus Christ. For we see many
men burst with pride, and they wot not why. There is nothing but wind and
smoke in all the things which they surmise of them selves. Howbeit the very
cause why they seek not Jesus Christ, is for want of due examination of them
selves: and such are the Hypocrites, and the Counterfetters, and those that
are puffed up with ouerweening of their own works. Therefore (as I have
touched already) it behooves us to look to our own state, and to see how
wretched we be till our Lord Jesus Christ pity us. That is the way too
prepare us too come unto him. And that shall serve for one point. Howebeeit
that is not yet all. For there (...) that can grant them selves too be
sinners, and that there is nothing in them but vanity: and yet notwithstanding
they welter nevertheless in their own filthy dung. And why* For they co^ceyue
not Gods justice, but are (as ye would say) doted in this world. None of all
these unthrifts which give them selves over to drunkenness, or to whoredom,
or to such other lewdness, can excuse their vilanies, but that they are feign
to be ashamed of them: and yet nevertheless they delight in them, and continue
still in them as if they were hardened. And why? Because they be made drunken
with this world, and the devil has so clozed up their eyes, that they see
not how they must one day come to account. They play the amazed men, and bear
them selves in hand that they shall always stand at a stay, and so they go
forward with their naughtiness, and never sighe nor be sorry for the matter,
but are always laughing at it, as though they meant to spite God wilfully. We
see then that one sort is let, yea or rather utterly turned back from
coming to Jesus Christ, because they presume upon their own wisdom, and are
possessed with an imagination that Satan has put into their head, so that too
their own seeming they be wise enough without Jesus Christ, and therefore they
hold scorn of him. The other sort (which are infinite in number)
notwithstanding that they knowledge themselves to be wretched sinners: do
nevertheless not seek the remedy. And why? For this present world
possesses them, and they be so wrapped in it, as they can not lift up their
eyes, nor their minds, to seek the remedy that is ready for them in Jesus
Christ. So much the more need therefore have we to mind the thing that I
have touched already: that is too wit, that we must rid our selves of all
selfetrust and ouerweening, and be so grieved as we may never be in rest till
we have found succor in our Lord Jesus Christ. And let us not only open our
eyes to see our own foulness, and to be ashamed of it: but also let us
consider that this life is nothing, and that God has set us here as in a
wayfaring, wherein he intends to try whether we will come to him or no.
Therefore let every of us summon him self evening and morning, and as often as
we look upon our sinn^^ let them be as spurs to prick us and provoke us to
repair unto God, so as we may not (...) brute beasts, nor be hilde back in
this world, but that our necessity may always drive us too resort too our
Lord Jesus Christ. Thus ye see how we may glory in the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ. And Saint Paul has purposely spoken here of the cross,
because the matter that he delte with, was the pulling down, and as it were
the treading under foot, of all loftynesse which men aspire unto. For we will
needs be always somewhat of our selves, and hold still some worthiness. To
the end therefore that we might be discharged of that wicked affection: Saint
Paul tells us that Jesus Christ the son of God can not be our glory, but
only in respect that he was crucified for us. And heerevpon inseweth that which
he adds, namely that we shall be crucified to the world, and the world to us,
when we shall have learned to glory in the only mere grace that is brought us
by our lord Jesus Christ. As how? surely they that are not crucified to the
world, that is to say, they that covet to be in some authority, and to set
out them selves, they that desire to be honored and exalted, and (to be short)
they that are drawn hither and thither of their lusts, do not yet know what
it is too glory in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ: for they should have
begone at the foresaid point, that is too wit, of being confounded in them
selves. Therefore not without cause does S. Paul say, that for as much as he
had settled his glory in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, he had quite
forsaken and given over the world. Now by the world he means all that is
delightsome to the flesh, as when men think neither upon God, nor upon the
life of heaven, so as one is given to covetousness, another to ambition, and
every man is driven by his own natural sway, and there is not any that
passes further than this world. When men follow their own swinge, and God
has not yet touched them with his holy spirit to draw them too him: surely
although they do all fling over the feelds, and run astray: yet is there
great diversity in their affections, so that if the matter come to trial, one
draws one way, and another another way clean contrary: and to be short, men
seem to differ quite and clean one from another. But yet they be all alike in
one thing, that (...) wit, that they would advance themselves to the
worldwarde, that they be given to their own private profit or pleasures. At a
word, they be so entangled here, that they could find in their hearts too be
separated from God. But S. Paul says that when we shall have set all our
glory in our Lord Jesus Christ, knowing that by the means of his Cross he
has dedicated us unto his father, and purchaced us the kingdom of heaven:
then it will be easy for us to withdraw our selves from the world, and to be
as it were cut off from it. And why? For it is certain that whosoever has bin
touched and wounded to the quick with the feeling of his sins, will so
pursue the grace that has bin given him in our lord Jesus Christ, as the world
shall be nothing with him. And in good sooth we show that all the spiritual
benefits which God offreth us, and whereunto the calls us are as things of
nothing unto us, in that we esteem them not in comparison of the trumperie
and inticements of Satan. What is this world if a man view it in it self?
There is no man but he sees how frail our life is, and how it is but as a
smoke that passes and vanishes away: and yet we see men frye still in their
affections, and how they be utterly carried away and ravished with them. God
on his side cries out. Ye wretched folk, ye be more destitute of wit than
little children. For ye buzie your heads about mooneshine in the water, and
about pelting trifles wherein there is nothing but foolishness, and ye be
wholly wedded unto the^: and yet in the mean season when I offer you perfect
happiness, ye make none account of it, all is one to you. Ye see then that
the cause why we be so cold and negligent now a days in receiving the
benefits which God offreth us by his Gospel: is for that the world has gotten
the possession of us aforehand: and on the other part we also do set too much
store by the world. And why do we so? Because we know not the inestimable
benefits that God offers us. Therefore let us join these two together, that
is to wit, that we be crucified to the world, and the world to us, because we
have our glory in our Lord Jesus Christ crucified. But this is easier to be
said than to be done: and therefore every man must strain himself in his own
behalf, and when he understands this lesson, he must put it in practice. For
if we covet to be taken and auowed for Christians before God and his Angers: we
must be conformabl^ (...) the holy Ghost in the thing that he sets down
here. And in very deed if we were not too far ouerseene, we have occasion
of it enough, as has bin said before. For they that do but only enter into
themselves to consider what they be, and what their state is so long as they be
separated from Jesus Christ, must needs be scared with the feling of gods wrath
which they have deserved, when they perceive themselves to be plu^ged in such
cursednesse, that it were much better for the^ if the earth had swallowed the^
up a hundred times, than to have lived in that plight but one day, being in the
mean while enemies to their God, from whose hands they can not escape.
Therefore let us learn to look to our selves. Such as intend to deck
themselves to the worldward, and specially women, will look in a glass, and
that shall be done with as much curiosity and warenesse as may be. But in the
mean while we look not upon our selves to spy our own wa^ts and filthiness,
to the end we might humble our selves truly before God, and seek our glory
where it is to be had. Now, it is certain that he which knows his own reproach
and shame, will seek to come to the remedy of it, at leastwise of Gods spirit
work lively in us, and that we be not sotted by Satan, as I have said before.
Let us learn, let us learn to look upon ourselves, both without feining, and
without flattery. And when we shall have known our own wa^ts and miseries, let
us resort to our lord Jesus Christ. And forasmuch as al loftiness,
stateliness, and vaunting must be beaten down by means of the Cross: Let us
be truly crucified to the world, and let the world also be nothing unto us. Now
whereas S. Paul says, that the world was crucified to him, and he to the
world: it is true that he meeneth another thing [than plain crucifying]. For
thereby he intended to show yet more strongly, how we may renounce the world,
and be separated from it, namely by being crucified to ourselves as in respect
of the world, that is to say, by mortifying all the lusts that fight one against
another within us, and have too much force, and inflame us al wholly like a
burning fire, and cast us here and there, because we see that the son of God
was feign to suffer so reprochful a death for us. Who would now make his
triumphs and braueries in the world, when he sees that he which is the head
of the Angels, and unto who^ belong all majesty, glory, and dominion, (...)
hanged upon tree, and made accursed and abominable for us? Gal. 3. c. 13.
Thus ye see by what means al our lusts may be mortified, and the death and
passion of our Lord Jesus Christ work so in our hearts, as our lusts may be
no more so ticklishe as they have bin. And that is for one point. Again, the
world must be crucified unto us. As how? By esteeming all worldly things as
chafe and corruption (according as in very deed there is not any thing in
them which is not corruptible) in comparison of the spiritual benefits
which Jesus Christ has brought us, and which we enjoy by this means. For
in very deed all worldly things are corruptible. And moreover, what else are
all the things which men covet so sore and so vehemently that they be utterly
entangled in them, but snares that Satan has laid too catch them withal?
Are they not al of them illusions and trumperies? Yes surely be they. Seeing
it is so then, let us learn too set nothing by the world, and too be fully
persuaded and resolved in our selves, that God is our freende, that he
acknowledges us for his children and heirs, and that he blisseth us, and that
without those things we be miserable. By this means then ye see we may
pass lightly through the world, and not be stayed not pulled back by any
thing, for we will always look still to that mark. We know we ought to
make have too come too the place that God calls us too: and if the affections
of this world entangle us, we shall be estraunged from our God by that means.
Thus ye see in effect what we have to remember upon this streyne. Now
heerevpon S. Paul adds, that in Jesus Christ neither Circumcision nor
Uncircumcision avails any thing at all: but the new creature. As if he
should say, that they which did then trouble the Church, had nothing to move
them thereto but their own vayngloriousnesse. For to stir up great troubles
when the Church is not furthered nor fares the better by them, surely it
shows that men seek nothing else, but to set up them selves in the room of
our Lord Jesus Christ. For what should be all our drift, but that the son of
God might reign among us, and we be ruled by the word of his Gospel, and
that his power might be known, to the end that both great and small might
put their whole trust in him? And therefore according hereunto, let us be
reso^^ed in our whole life to obe^ God, and to submit our selves to his word.
For like as Gods spiritual temple consists in faith and newness of life: so
faith imports that we should do homage unto God for all his benefits, that
we should have our recourse unto him, that we should blaze abroad his praises,
and that his holy name should be called upon among us. That is the way for us
to be advanced to be Gods temple. Ageine on the other side, we must also be
renewed in our life, and by patience learn to renounce ourselves, and to
dedicate ourselves unto God. Lo what all teachers and preachers ought too
procure. They then which shoot not at that mark, do show well enough that
their intent is not to serve our Lord Jesus Christ. So then S. Paul declares
that nothing avails in Jesus Christ, but the new creature: that is to say,
that we must come too that point, according as we have seen how he said
heretofore in the second to the Corinthans, 2. Cor. 5. c. 17.
that whosoever will be esteemed in Jesus Christ, must become a new creature.
For if one man boast of his eloquence, another of his wit, another of his great
learning, and another of his trim behavior or goodly personage all this is but
vanity. Therefore let us learn too forsake our selves quite, and to forsake
the world, and to give our selves to him that has bought us, to the end that
we be no more looce. For it is good reason that Jesus Christ having bought us
so deerly, should possess us and fully enjoy us. But that cannot be done,
except every of us renounce himself, and all things else that may hold us
among men. Lo what we have to mark. Now Saint Paul speaks of Circumcision
and uncircumcision, because that (as ye have seen before) the disputation and
controversy which he had was about the Ceremonies of the Law, which he
comprehends here under the particular term of Circumcision. For the Jews
would needs have men to retain still all the shadows and figures which
served but for a time. And therefore S. Paul scorning all those things, says
that our Lord Jesus Christ is not come to hold us still in the old forworne
figures, but that for as much as the veyle of the temple is rent asunder, and
he has in himself the body and substance of all the shadows that were in the
Law: men must hold themselves contented with him, and therefore Circumcision
was no (...) any thing worth. We shall profit our selves the more by (...)
text, if we apply it to that which we saw yesterday. For in pope (...) they
have many pelting tryfles wherein they put all the trust of holiness. And if a
man ask the Papists how they ca^ deserve favor at Gods hand and purchase
remission of their sins, as they make their boast: They will clap you in the
mouth with their holywater, their Tapers, their Sencings, their Organplayes,
their chauntings, their Pilgrimages and with a number of other things. Agein
they have their foolish devotions of trotting from altar to altar and from
chapel to chapel. Moreover they must buy good store of Masses. To be short,
all Gods service which is so termed in the popedom, is but a maze and gulf of
superstitions invented of their own heads. But let us consider what those
things may avail. God has not made mention of any of the^, but men have
devised them of themselves, yea or rather Satan has whispered them into their
ears, too trouble Gods service withal. And yet notwithstanding, the papists
imagine that there is neither Religion, nor faith, nor service of God, nor
zeal, except a man be ravished with their foolesbables. But S. Paul speaking
even of the ceremonies that God had ordained in his law, says that they be
hensforth as nothing. And why? For God thinks it enough that we serve him
with a pure conscience, and that having put our trust in him, we call upon him,
knowing that we hold all things of him, and therwithal that we live uprightly
and faithful, one with another, knowing that charity is the fulfilling of the
law and the end of the law: and finally that we be so dedicated to our god, as
we may live chastely and in all holiness, Tit. 2. c. 13.
waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ as it is said in the epistle
to Titus. That the^ is the first point of the holiness and perfection which
God shows us by his word. But the Papists will on the contrary part say,
how so? what shall become of so many goodly devotions? Shall they all be
abolished? Nay it were better that God should be plucked out of Heaven. Lo
what the doltishnesse of the Papists is. But we see how Saint Paul tells
us, that if men be so sore drowned in their own fancies, as too surmize that
they can work woonders with God, and be hild down too their own pelting
trashe: all of it is nothing woorthe. Who has pronounced it? God by the mouth
of Saint Paul. What [auaileth (...)n? The new creature. And what is meant by
the new creature? T^^^ we should fall too examining of our lives after such
a sort, as we might be utter abaced in our selves: and thereupon offer unto
God the spiritual sacrifyces which we owe unto him, even offering ourselves
too him to the end he may have pity and mercy upon our myseries, and provide
remedy for them: and finally be ready too follow him whither soever he
calls us, and not have any other wisdom than his only word, knowing that
he cannot be served with pompes and gay shows of great glittering too the
world, but he is contented that we should simply offer up unto him our
thoughts and affections. And therefore it is long of none but of our selves,
that we know not what S Paul meeneth, nor wheretoo this lesson may serve us.
For it is certain, that all they which flatter not themselves in their own
vices, but look up unto God, knowing that they must come before his judgment
seat will rid their hands of all glory. And furthermore they will consider
what God commaundes them by his word, how he wilbee served of us, and what he
allows, so as they shall no more be in danger too be deceived, by those
tryfling toys wherein the hypocrites are plunged over head and ears. For it
is certain that whereas the Papists torment themselves (as we see) to serve
God: it is too none other end, but that he should hold them acquit, and they
escape his hands, and not be constreined to serve him as he commands: for
they despise the whole law, and yet in the mean while have a number of things
to put into their account, which they would have God to allow of. But (as I
said) the end of all their doings, is to imagine themselves discharged to
Godward, and that he should not press the^ to sore, and yet notwithstanding,
that they might follow their own swindge, and take leave to assoile themselves
of al their sins, and that God having I wot not what, (that is too say, some
fair countenance of their own bringing) should have his mouth shet and not
be so hardy as too speak a word. Now then we see whereat S. Paul amed.
And he adds in the wynding up, Peace and mercy be upon all those that
submit themselves too that rule, and upon Israel that perteyneth too God. In
speaking of the Rule, he shows that men may well ma^^ themselves believe this
or that (...) yet in the mean while God will not bow, for he is not mutable
that he should suffer himself to be led by our folyes, or be made to swerve
aside: that is impossible says S. Paul, and whatsoever befall, the Law that
God has stablished must abide unchangeable as he himself is. No doubt but we
will admit this at the first sight. For who will not willingliy abide that God
should be our superior? Yea and we perceive full well, that to say the contrary
were blasphemy. Ye see then that at a glaunce the whole world can well grant
that God should be our souerein, and his law our rule, but therwithall let us
see what liberty men take to themselves. Every man deuiseth one thing or
other, and when he has so done, he would have all other men too observe the
same: every man then would have his own rule alone by himself. True it is
that in the popedom all are not of the rule of S. Frauncis or of S. Dominik:
but yet for all that there is not so doting an old fool, nor so superstitious
an hypocrite in the popedom but he has his rule. Ageine, there is not so young
a calfe but he has his rule too. For all of them will say, that is my
devotion. And their using of the word Devotion, is as much to say with them,
as, God is put back, and I must have my liberty to do what I list, and God
must hold himself contented with it. Thus we see how the devilish pride of me^
in fleeting to and fro, and in wandering out at rouers, gadding now on the one
side and now on the other, is all one as if they made crooked and overthwart
paths, and that God should therefore be feign to bow his rule, and become
pliable to bend according to their fancies. So much the more therefore behooves
it us too mark well how it is said here, that men may well torment
themselves, but yet Gods rule shall continue still, and hold on his course and
keep his pace. And what is this rule? It is that it should suffize us to have
perfection in such wise, as our Lord Jesus Christ shows it us in his Gospel.
Not that it can be fully in us: but that it behooves us too labor toward it.
For when we speak of perfection it is not meant that we can atteine to it so
long as we live: but that we must not swerve one way nor other, neither to the
right hand nor to the left, but keep on still to the mark that God shows us.
Ye see then that it behooves us to become new creatures: that is to say, we
(...) renounce ourselves and y^^lde wholly unto God. And since it is so: let us
bethink us too sub^^^^ ourselves to the said rule, and to frame ourselves
thereafter. For every man will soon set forth his legs and feet: but that
shall be but to fisk here and there. And therefore to the end we stray not,
let us learn to stick fast to the things that God shows and teaches us by
his word. Now whereas S. Paul says that peace and mercy shall be upon them:
it is to show us, that we may defye the whole world, and that although we be
condemned by the folly of men, yet we need not to pass for it, but may
keep on our race still: so God allow of us, it is sufficient. For surely we
show that we yield him not the honor which is due to him, when we be so
shaken down by the foolish judgment of the world, and with the opinions
that men sow abroad of us. If it be said of us, these fellows behave not
themselves well, and we be grieved at it, and thereupon would frame ourselves
to every man's liking: it is certain that in the mean while we shall swerve
aside from God. So then let us mark well how S. Paul has told us here,
that although men condemn us and find fault in our doyngs: (as certainly the
world will never agree with God:) yet notwithstanding we must esteem it as
nothing, and hold ourselves contented that God blisseth us, and offers us
here all happiness under the word peace, certifying us that he will have
compassion upon us, how miserable soever we be. Although men should spit in our
faces, and although there appear no such virtues in us as were requisite: yet
notwithstanding, if we keep on our way still unto God, we shall ever find him
pitiful to bear with our infirmities, and to relieve all our miseries. When
we be once at the point, it ought to suffyze us. But on the contrary part, let
us understand also that in blissing such as frame themselves too the rule of
God, the holy Ghost curses and detesteth, yea and utterly shakes off such as
run at rouers after that sort, and set more by their own fancies than by all
laws, and will needs have leave to do what they list, and harden themselves
in such wise against Gods word. Although then that they be had in reputatation
to the worldward, and be in a manner drunken in their own pride and
presumption, and set more by themselves than rea^^^ would they should: yet we
see that God does always hold them as accursed. So then the thing that we
have to remember in effect, is that we have but one only rule, which is
contained in the Gospel. And whither does that rule lead us? Even to this,
that we bring not to God what we our selves think good, or what we have deuized
of our own head: but that we submit ourselves wholly unto him and to his word,
and consider also that seeing we have all perfection in our Lord Jesus Christ,
we must be contented with him alone, specially for as much as we see God to be
pitiful in having mercy upon us, and that our life shall be happy and
blissed of him, so we go on forth whither soever he calls us: Like as on the
contrary part, what soever opinion the world have of us, and how much so
ever it favor us, we must needs be accursed, if we have not the rule that
Saint Paul speaks of here. And he adds Israel that belongs too God:
too show that they which serve God after that spiritual manner, shall always
be acknowledged of him for his people. For Saint Paul's enemies against whom
he disputed in all this Epistle, would needs have all the Ceremonies kept,
and that they should be the marks of the Church, as they surmyzed. Likewise
in these days the Papists would have men too keep [Oyle and] Cream and
diverse other things. But Saint Paul's enemies had much more color than the
Papists have, and their case was much better in comparison. Nevertheless
Saint Paul rejects all those things, and says that God muzeth not upon
any of those small toys. True it is that he had ordained the figures of the
Law for a time, and they had also some profit in them, because they served
too lead the people too our Lord Jesus Christ. But now that we have the
substance and pithe of them in him: we must give them quyte over. Then of
much more lykelyhood they be not the Israel of God, that set forth
themselves with great pomp before men: but they that have the true mark of
God. For when the Papists speak too us of the Church, the Pope must needs
be there with his tryple Crown, the Bishops must be disguyzed too play
their interlude, there must be a sort of horned beasts, all must glister,
the Priests and Monks must be present, and the eyes of the simple souls
must be dazeled. Ye see then wherein the Church of God consists after the
opinion of the Papists: that is too wit, in pomp and in tryfling and
unprofitable gewgawes.

And what say they too the Sacraments? They must have this and that: and to
be short, they have their ma^kes which they take to be good stuff. But in
the mean while let us come too the Gospel. What shall a man find there?
Nothing but plain simplicity. God will not have the preachers of his word and
the ministers of his sacraments too be disguised, nor too make so many
murlimewes: neither is it his will that his sacraments should be defiled with
men's inventions, for all that is nothing before God. Therefore let us bear
well in mind the definition of the true Church which Saint Paul sets
down here, too the end we be not shaken when men say too us. How now? See I
pray you how goodly things they be. They be so in deed according too our
natural understanding. For after as a man is fleshly and earthly: so will he
be always inclined to follow the thing that caryeth a fair show to his
senses. But it is not for us too judge of Gods service: we must stick too that
which he has determined, for his sentence cannot be repealed: which is that
we must seek al our whole wisdom in Jesus Christ, which thing we then do
when we obey him, and not else. Furthermore let us understand that he will not
have us any longer tied too the outward things which he ordained in the time of
the Law: but he will have us to be contented with Jesus Christ alone, and with
the perfection that is in him. And thereupon we have also too mark, how he
wishes the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ too be with their spirit. For it
shows that the world by reason of his unthankfulness: is not worthy too
see the benefits that are offered it in Jesus Christ. The Gospel shall
[perchaunce] be preached enough, but yet in the mean while we see how every
man shrinkes back and wrytheth aside, as though we had conspyred too forsake
the good way of salvation, too cast our selves intoo ruin and destruction. And
what is the cause thereof? It is for that we have our minds empty, and the
Devil fynds always entrance into us, and thereupon tempts and provoke us too
flitter in the air. Too be short, until (...) grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with our spirit, it is certain that we shall always be as
wayeryug reeds, so as there shall be neither hold nor stay in us.

Ye see then that the point wheretoo we must come, is not only that God
should pour out his grace upon us, but that we also should so receive it in
heart and mind, as it may take root, not to hold us down here beneath, but
to lift up our affections and all our senses unto God. And because this
doctrine can never pass unspoken against, S. Paul does here defy all such
as lift up themselves against it, and says: Hereafter let no man trouble me,
for I bear the marks of our Lord Jesus Christ in my body. When he speaks
of the marks of our Lord Jesus Christ, he sets them against all the cotes
armours of Princes, against all their Crowns and scepters, and against all the
cognisances or badges, which they have too honor themselves withal, or to
purchase themselves any majesty or reverence to the worldward. When a Prince
intends to keep his estate, he will furnish and apparel himself in such
sort, as men shall not be able to look upon him without dazeling of their
eyes. And they do it, oftentimes because they have not in themselves wherewith
to win estimation, but are feign to borrow it else where: and so ye see it is
the fashion of worldlings to set out themselves with pomp and bravery, and to
use many things to get themselves reputation. To be short, the world does
always borrow of others, because it has nothing but vanity in it self. But
S. Paul tells us that the marks of our Lord Jesus Christ are much better,
preciouser, and of far greater Majesty, than all the things wherewith the
world is so ravished as we see. But by the way we must see what he meant by
these marks. 2. Cor. 11. e. 24.
He has showed it [in another Epistle] heretofore, where he says that he had
bin often whipped, that he had bin once stoned that he had bin cast in prison,
that he had suffered hunger and thirst, and finally that he had bin as an
outcast and forlorn person. True it is that such reproachful things would be
shunned to the worldward. But S. Paul says that they be much better, than all
the honor and pomp that could be devised to be done unto him, and that he
caryeth those marks, to the end that men should not stop him of his course,
nor hinder him of discharging his duty. Now then we see how S. Paul's
meaning is, first that if we be Christians and (...) true Church of God, we
must keep this order, namely that we be united together, or that we be all
as one. And how is that? Not every man after his own fancy, as we see some
do, who being of a froward mind cannot possibly frame themselves to others,
but will needs keep alone by themselves, like shrewde horses, and it were too
be wished that there were Hermitages and Cloisters for such manner of people,
when they will not by any means join with the order of the Church. Therefore
when they do so separate themselves from the company of the faithful through
their own pride, they must be made the Diuelles Hermites and Cloysterers. But
howsoever the world go, men see why they be so hidden: namely because the
Devil holds and possesses them, and their desire is nothing else but too
have I wot not what a separation, too turn quyte and clean away from God.
But Saint Paul tells us, that the rule which we must go by is this, namely
that we make Jesus Christ our shooteanker, laboring too fashion our selves like
unto him, so that whenever he speaks, we may yield our selves too his
saying, and every of us keep his order: and afterward that we help one
another. For we may well brag of perfection and of this and that: but if we
indeuer not too further the buylding up of the spiritual temple, surely we
shall still serve Satan, and be as slaves under his tyranny. Therefore let us
learn to have one conformity among us, tending all together too our Lord
Jesus Christ. And furthermore let such as have stoutnesse and constancy to
walk in Gods Law, defy all these Cockerelles that mount up in pride after
that fashion, too bring in this or that. For Jesus Christ will always know
his own marks. That is too say, although we be despyzed too the worldward,
yet shall we always be auowed too be Gods children. And therefore let us go
on forewarde still, and let such as would stop us, be sure that God will
beat them down, as we have seen heretofore. Yea and it is good reason that
they should be scattered and confounded, Gal. 5. b. 12.
since they break the unity of the Church: and for as much as they will not
employ their service (according too their ability) too the furtherance of the
kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, G^rt must needs overthrow them how
glorious or prydefull so ever they be. Thus ye see what we have too gather
upon this text, if we mind too continue in the inioying and possession of
the benefits that have bin purchaced for us so dearly, by the death and
passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, and are still daily offered us by the
Gospel.

And now let us fall down before the Majesty of our good God with
acknowledgment of our faults, praying him that we may be so wounded with
them, as they may make us too bewail them and too crave forgiveness of them,
and also too reform them in such wise by true repentance, as we may fight
manfully against all the vices and corruptions of our flesh, till he have
rid us quyte and clean of them all, too clothe us again with his own
righteousness. And so let us all say, Almighty God heavenly father etc.

Thus end the Sermons of Master John Calvin upon the Epistle of S. Paul too
the Galathians.
All praise, glory, honor, and thanks be only unto God through his Son
our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
The prayer which M. John Calvin made ordinarily before the beginning of his
Sermons.
LEt us call upon our good God and father, praying him too vouchsafe too turn
away his face from the great number of faults and offenses, whereby we cease
not to provoke his wrath against us: and forasmuch as we be too too unworthy
to appear before his majesty, it may please him to look upon us in the
countenance of his well-beloved son o^ Lord Jesus Christ, accepting the desert
of his death and passion, for a full recompense of all (...) sins, that by
means thereof he may like well of us, and vouchsafe to inlighten us by his
spirit, in the understanding of his word, and grant us the (...) to receive
the same in true fear and humility, so as we may be taught thereby to put our
trust in him, to serve and honor him by glorifying his holy name in all our
life, and to yield him the love and obedience which faithful servants owe to
their masters, and children too their fathers, seeing it has pleased him too
call us to the number of his servants and children. And let us pray unto him as
our good master has taught us too pray, saying. Our father which art. etc.

The Prayer that Master John Calvin made ordinarily before the beginning of
his Sermons.
LEt us fall down before the face of our good God. etc. (Here he adds as the
matter treated of in his Sermon, gives him occasion too require at Gods hand,
and because the same changes almost in every Sermon, it cannot here be
specified.) That it may please him to grant this grace, not only to us, but
also to all people and Nations of the earth, bringing back all poor ignorant
souls from the miserable bondage of error and darcknesse, to the right way of
salvation, for the doing whereof it may please him to raise up true and
faithful ministers of his word, that seek not their own profit and
vainglorie, but only the advancement of his holy name, and the welfare of his
flock: and contrariwise root out all sects, errors and heresies, which are
seeds of trouble and division among his people, too the end we may live in
good brotherly concord all together: and that it may please him to guide with
his holy spirit, all kings, princes and magistrates that have the rule of the
sword, to the end that their reigning be not by covetousness, cruelty,
tyranny, or any other evil and disordered affection, but in all justice and
uprightness, and that we also living under them, may yield them their due
honor and obedience, that by the mean of good peace and quietness, we may
serve God in all holiness and honestie^: and that it may please him to comfort
all afflicted persons, whom he visit^^ after diverse manners with cr^^es and
tribulations: all people ^^om he afflicts with plague, war or famine, or
other his rods: and all persons that are smitten with poverty, imprisonment,
sickness, banishment, or other calamity of body (...) ^exation of mind:
giving them all good patience, (...) them full discharge of their miseries: and
specially that is (...) please him too have pity upon all his poor faithful
ones, that are dispersed in the captivity of Babylon under the tyranny of
Antichrist, chiefly which suffer persecution for the witnessing of his truth,
strengthening them with true constancy, and comforting them, and not suffering
the wicked and ravening wolves too execute their rage against them, but giving
them such a true steadfastness as his holy name may be glorified by them both
in life and death: and finally that it may please him to strengthen all
Churches that are nowadayes in danger and assaulted for the quarrel of his
holy name, and overthrow and destroy all the devises, practices and attemptes
of all his adversaries, to the intent that his glory may shine over all, and
the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ be increased and advanced more and
more: Let us pray him for all the said things in such wise as our good master
and Lord Jesus Christ has taught us to pray, saying: Our father which art.
etc.

ALso let us pray our good God to give us true continuance in his holy faith,
and to increase it from day to day, whereof we will make confession, saying: I
believe in God the father. etc.

The blessing of the people after the Sermon.
THe grace of God the father, and the peace of our Lord Jesus Christ through
the fellowship of the holy Ghost dwell with us for ever. Amen.
