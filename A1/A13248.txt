THE SCHOOL OF THE NOBLE and Worthy Science of Defense.

Being the first of any English man's invention, which professed the said
Science; So plainly described, that any man may quickly come to the true
knowledge of their weapons, with small pains and little practice.

Then read it advisedly, and use the benefit thereof when occasion shall serve,
so shall thou be a good Commonwealth man, live happy to thy self, and
comfortable to thy friend.

Also many other good and profitable Precepts and Counsels for the managing of
Quarrels and ordering thy self in many other matters.

LONDON, Printed by NICHOLAS OAKS. 1617.

TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE CHARLES, PRINCE OF WALES, DVKE OF CORNEwale,
York, Albany and Rothesay, Marquis of Ormount Earl of Rosse, and Baron of
Armanoch, high Seneschal of Scotland, Lord of the Isles, and Knight of the most
Noble order of the Garter.
MOst Gracious and Noble Prince, the many great and kind favors which I
received from the hands of your late Brother deceased, unto whom I was tutor in
the skill of weapons, to my no little credit, which makes me now turn back to
show my love in a small measure unto your Princely self, and yet it is as much
as I am able, a bunch of grapes is but a small present, and yet King Philip of
Macedon did receive them, and accept them, and the rather, because a poor man
presented them, and therefore J trust your Highness will more esteem the
good will of the giver, then the value of the gift.

Three things did chiefly encourage me to publish it under the glorious name of
your gracious Highness: The first is, in regard of your Highness deep desire
to gain experience in all Arts and Sciences, the which is seen by jour Graces
favoring and furthering any man which is endued with any good quality, therein
rightly resembling a branch of the same Stock from whence your Excellency
sprang, of whom in my next Epistle to the Reader I will speak more at large:
But at this time for doubt of being offensive, with the renewing of old
griefs, I stand in a maze, like unto that child, who being asked whether he
loved his father or his mother best, stood mute as doubting how to answer for
fear of displeasing the one of them: even so in this place will J. Now the
second cause of this my Dedication unto your Excellency is, in respect of my
vehement love whereto in duty I am bound unto your Princely self: and thirdly,
that it may pass under your Highness protection, the better to shroud it
self from backe-biters and fault-finders, least amongst such it be taken up
like a friendlesse vagarant: Oh therefore let it find favor, J humbly entreat
your Highness, although it can little pleasure your Princely self, yet it may
stead many others, and so doubting least J have troubled your Highness over
long. J will therefore here draw the Curtains, and commit your Highness to
the Protection of the Almighty, who ever bless, preserve and keep your
Highness with long life, and prosperous health, and happiness to the worlds
end.

By your Highness to be commanded so long as I live. Joseph Swetnam.

An Epistle unto the common Reader.
IN setting out of a book, friendly Reader, this I know, that there is no
better a thing to be observed then order, for except there be an order in all
things, all runs to confusion, but what do I mean to talk of orders,
which am no Scholar, nor have no learning; but only a little experience, which
God and nature has bestowed upon me. As it is impossible to build a Chuch
without lyme or stone, no more can a workman work without tools, yet to
avoid idleness, something I will make of it, although I cannot make it sound
to so good a tune as I would, for want of learning, for I was never at Oxford
but while I baited my horse; nor at Cambridge but while one Sturbridge fair
lasted: wherefore if you do examine me concerning learning, I shall answer
you as the fellow did the gentleman, who asking him the way to London, a poke
full of plumbes sir said he; or as he which came from a Sermon was asked what
he heard there; he said it was a good Sermon, and the Preacher spoke well, but
he could not tell one word what he said, no more can I answer one word
scholler-like or according to learning; yet both at Oxford and Cambridge I
looked upon the Scholars, and they looked upon me, and so I became a little
the older, but never the wiser; wherefore if I should continue tempering this
book so long till I had put it in order, I should resemble those, which do
make their apparel so long of the newest fashion, until they are quite out of
fashion, or like as the fiddlers do their strings, who wrest them and temper
them so long, until they bring them out of all time, tune, and reason, least I
should do so I will let it go with this drafte as it is: but gentle Reader
look not here to gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of thistles: nor of a
wild and a barren tree, nothing else but wild and barren fruit, yet amongst
dust, sometimes there are pearls found, and in hard rocks gold and stones of
great price, I have here as it were mixed wheat and rye, barlye and oats,
Beans and Pease altogether, now take a little pains to separate that grain
which thou likest best for thine own benefit. I give thee here a friendly
caveat, to prepare thy self in a readiness, for although thou art at quiet now,
yet do thou not know how soon thou shall be urged to take weapons in hand,
as my self and many others have been, when I least thought upon it, therefore
to have judgment and skill in weapons is good, although thou never have
occasion to use it. The Proverb says cunning is no burden, the same mouth
which at one time says, I will live quietly, for I will make no brawles with
any, yet at another time he again will say, oh that I had skill, for then would
I be revenged on such a one that has injuriously wronged me. Therefore for
such a cause be prepared before hand, for if the King were sure that he should
never have wars, what need had he then to provide armor and weapons, but in
the time of peace he provides himself; the wise Mariner prouides in a calm
for a storm, for things doubtful are to be dreadful. It is better to live in
fear then in security, and to this purpose Tully has a pretty saying which
goes thus; he which desires peace let him provide for wars, but I fear me
that the tide will be spent, before I can double this point, and therefore here
I will cast anchor, and will ride in this rode something longer then I would,
for fear least I cast my bark away on a lee shore, for want of water; these
words of wariness do I use because there are many which no sooner out of the
shell, but are cast away like an addle egg.

Therefore I would not have young sprigs spoiled in the blosome, I mean I would
not have young branches or young entereres into the world imbarke themselves in
the ship of fools, for fear least they cast themselves away in a manner,
before they have had any beginning, for I have known many blasted in the
budding in a manner, before they came to know cheese from chalk: only for
want of instruction, and likewise some again have perished, and yet not for
want of instruction, but they have known what was good for them, and yet would
not seek it, but have delaid the means, as many delay their repentance, till
the latter day, or till it be too late, not much unlike a sluggard, which
rowsing himself, and looking abroad in the morning, he sees that it is high
time to rise, yet sluggishly he lies down again to sleep, and so forgets
himself; even so many perish, some for want of good counsel, and some for
lack of forecasting a mischief before it do light upon them. It is said that
we must not tempt God. Math. 4. but I hold it a tempting of God to presume
wholly upon him for all occasions whatsoever, without seeking other means
which is commonly known, and by God prepared for us: as if we were sick men we
ought to take the Physicians counsel, and if wounded we must seek for help
of a Chyrurgian, if our house be on fire we must power on water, and if we fall
in a ditch, we must not lie still without using other means besides, saying
God help us, but for this and all other things God has appointed means, we
must seek and then no doubt God will give his blessing with it, but we must
not presume how carelessly soever we live, or how desperately soever we dye,
nothing can hinder us of our salvation, but so far deceived I fear me are
such, that there is a thunderbolt of mischief prepared for their ignorance
herein. Our Savior Christ would not presume so much of the mercy of God the
Father, as when he was upon the pinnacle to cast himself down, but he came
down by other means, for the stayres were made for the purpose; God the
father might otherwise have saved Noah without any Arc if it had pleased him,
but Noah had warning that such a thing should be, whereupon he sought a means
to save himself by making the Arc, therefore he that will not be prepared
before hand with oil in his Lamp, or with skill in his weapons, when there is
means to be found, he may be shut out of heaven as the five foolish virgins
were if he chance to be slain suddenly, as many a man has been, by dying
without repentance.

Indeed if there were no means then if we did with humbleness come unto God,
no doubt then I say but God would miraculously defend his servants, as he did
the children of Israel when their enemies were behind them, and the red sea
before them, then there was no means nor help left them, but only in the
Lord, but then the Lord stopped not his ears nor shortened not his arms, but
gave them passage with his outstretched arm through the red sea, and then again
they being in the wilderness, there was neither meat nor drink, and then and
there again the Lord sent them food from heaven, and he also made the hard
rocks gush forth rivers of water. The Mariner in distress throws over
board the Merchants goods which are in ship, and yet then finding small hope of
life he cutteth down the masts of the ship, and so he throws them and the
sails ouerboord, which should be the only mean to bring them to land, but
then these Mariners being bereft of al hope, they rely wholly upon God, which
never leaves in distress those which trust in him, but then he miraculously
does defend them, and bring them into a safe harbor contrary unto man's
expectation.

So not only here in this place, but as I go on I will show some examples out
of the book of God and from the Philosophers and other School men, and the
application to be applied unto our selves, for there is nothing written but
has been written for our learning, and of those we are to learn counsel of
which have run through the brambles, briers, and the mischief of the world.

Then be not wise in thine own conceit, for S. John and Paul says that the
wise are catched in their own craftiness. John 9. 13.1 Cor. 3.19. If the wise
are catched what then will become of the ignorant and foolish, not only of
this profession, but of all ethers; for there are many of all trades which do
think their own wit best, and hating to be reformed, but I wish such to take
heed of ignorance pitfall, least they fall into the springle with the
woodcocke; for who is so bold as blind bayard. But as some men of all trades
with small skill do go on and live by their trades and yet in a manner but
botchers, even so I have often hard many a man say, that with a little skill
they have saved their lives being put unto trial, for those which are in
danger of drowning will catch at a straw to save their lives, but for the most
part it so falls out, that if the father or the master be a coward, or
unskillful in his weapons, then the sons of that Father or the servants of
that Master, seldom prove good soldiers, not much unlike that saying of the
Prophet when the mother is an Hitite, and the Father an Ammorite, the child
seldom proves an Israelite. Ezekiel 45. Then we must not follow or go on
being led on blindfoldly, by a cowardly sort of people, which will say that a
good eye or a good heart is all that belongs unto the defense of a man's body,
these are they which professing themselves to be wise, are become fools. Romans
1.22. Or they may be compared unto those which talk of Robin hood and yet
never shot in his bow, so this trumpe have I cast in your way, Then show not
thy self worse then a beast, for beast have wit to find out remedies to cover
their grief.
for loath I am to leave you any starting holes to wind out at, but that you
may keep the high beaten way, least in seeking by-ways you wander quite out
of the way, yet mistake me not in thinking that hereby I seem to hale thee on
for thy own good, like a beast, for I do but lead thee with the cords of
love, and wish thee to taste of this my opinion which I have new broached. And
I make no doubt but in trial it will be no whit distasting unto thee, for by
experience I speak it that above all, skill is the key of the work, as the
eye to the body, or as the Captain to the soldiers, or the pilot to the ship;
if the eye be dark in walking, the body falls, if the Captain be ignorant,
then do the Soldiers march disorderly, or if the Pilot be unskillful, the
ship sails in danger, but as I was about to tell you of a sort of
logger-headed asses which further more will persuade their familiar friends, by
telling them that skill will do them no good, for when they have learned skill
and afterward when they shall have occasion to use their weapons, then such
dunces will say that skill will be forgoten and little thought upon. Also they
say that a man with a sword will cut off thy rapier at one blow, but I say this
is a most cowardly kind of ignorance, for if a skillful man do hold the
rapier, it is not a hundred blows with a sword can do a rapier any harm, no
although they light upon him. Therefore those which will persuade any from
learning skill with weapons, for the defense of their bodies, may fitly be
compared unto the false Prophets amongst the Jews, which persuaded them that
they should not fear nothing, but peace, peace, peace, when the Assyrians were
in a readiness to cut their throats as in the 6 of Jeremy the 14, there you
may read it, therefore a provident care ought to be had, as Iehosaphat did
when he feared the Moabits to come upon him, 2 Chronicles. 20.3. David lived
securely in Jerusalem, and without fear, which made him forget God, as in the
2. Sam. 11. the whole Chapter is worth the reading; does not the wisest man
that ever wrote say, that there is a time of war and a time of peace, Eccle.
3.8. If a man did know what hour the thief would come, he would surely watch,
wherefore be advised to deal wisely, but not like unto Pharaoh for he said,
let us deal wisely when he dealt most foolishly Exodus 1.10. and so we will
go on.

In reading over diverse Hystories I thereby understanding the noble acts, and
also noting the manly mind of these who lived many hundred years ago, whose
fame shall never dye, whereas cowardly dastards which never bent their studies
in marshall exploits, such I say at their death their fame dies with them, and
so they are quickly raked up in the ashes of forgetfulness, and buried in the
valley of oblivion. So that if a man would go search for the pedigree of their
gentility, they shall find it laid up in a beggars box, or as the Charter of a
City written in dust, whereas on the other side the valiant and gallant minded
men, although they dye, yet in their life time their manly acts and valiant
deeds which they worthily performed, some in the wars and some at single
combat, and some at other honorable and laudable exercises, whereby they
merited to themselves immortal fame for ever, for to some no exercise nor
weapon came amiss as in stead of many examples these two out of the book of
God shall be sufficient, David with his sling, (as Hercules with his Club) and
Sampson with his Iaw-bone or any other weapon which came next to his hand, but
loath I am to trouble you with so long an Epistle or Preface, yet for an
Introduction to the rest something I must say and most of that which I have and
will say is so necessary as the rest, although it be longer then I would, but
we will now to the matter.

Then thus, by reason of diverse errors which are in sundry men's teaching of
this noble art of defense, I therefore being pricked forward by the earnest
request of some of my friends, to describe the rules of weapons, which I by my
study have invented, and by practice brought to perfection, and likewise for my
countries benefit, I mean to better the unskillful in knowledge, I have
thought it good to open plainly the best grounds, which belongs to our
English weapons, that are now in use, so far as my simple invention by great
practice has attained unto. Another reason which moved me hereunto was where
some do find out many hidden secrets which they bury in the earth again with
their bodies, or else if they make it known, it shall be to such a faithful
friend as they love and affect dearly, all writers that ever wrote did write
either for profit or pleasure: some to profit others, and some to pleasure
themselves; and some have wrote common and necessary things for their own
posterity after them; I write but of common things, yet not so common as
necessary, and therefore my meaning is to make my secret study known so plainly
as I can unto all the world, for the benefit of many thousand yet unborn, for
every man has or should have skill in his weapons, the reasons shall follow,
as occasion shall serve hereafter more at large; but as yet I know the greatest
number are blinded in an ignorant conceit, I mean such as do think to
overcome their enemies if occasion do serve by quickness of the eye, or by a
kind of valorous resolution, which for the avoiding of this and such like
abuses, I have here and there put down sundry reasons in this book, although
they be not in order, yet take a little pains to seek them out, for I wrote
this book at such leasurable fits as time would permit me; now for affection
sake some will say it is well done, and others again will say it is reasonable
and indifferent, and so I pray you let it pass, for if I should perceive it
should go for stark naught, then should I account my time and labor very ill
bestowed; but yet this I know, if it were ten times worse then it is, yet would
it be welcome to a number of my old friends and familiar acquaintance, such as
were the cause of this my idle time spending, who were earnest with me for the
setting forth of this work. Lo this is the anchor whereon my hope depends,
but yet I make a doubt least that my book may light into the hands of some
envious mates, who never knew me, yet will not stick to say upon the very
first fight, oh this is such a man's work, I know well enough what he could
do, and yet will not fully give up their verdit, but only shake the head,
with a wry mouth and a smiling countenance, throwing it from them, and so
seeming by their silence that they could further disgrace me, but will not.
Indeed it is a more easier matter for such to find fault with a part of my
book then to amend the whole, but I could wish such learn before they take
upon them to control, but those which are wise and kind, will accept of my
good will, for I have given out this but as a theme; let a wiser then I rhyme
upon it, and although it seem but as it were a glimpse of the noble Art of
defense, in regard of the substance, yet some will perceive day at a little
hole; wherefore travel further in it, till you find out the substance, like a
good Surgion search the wound to the bottom before thou lay a plaster, I mean
read it over before thou give judgment; and then play the wise man's part
which is to speak little, although he think much; indeed I must confess a
vanity in my self and that I have deserved blame, because so bluntly I have
set forth such an vnperserued piece of work, but my reasons in the latter end
of the book may a little excuse me, but in the mean while let it be never the
worse welcome vntothee, for that it has my poor name unto it, I speak this
because I know there are some will speak they care not what, to disgrace they
know not whom, without rendering any reason at all, out only out of a dogged
humor, or an idle brain, some finding fault with the gards, and some because I
have written of things which belongs not to the matter or ground of this
work, and some because it is a book of pictures, accounting a book of
pictures fit for children and fools; to answer such I say when a child or a
fool does look in a glass, he does think there is a baby on the other side,
but when men of discretion look in a glass, they do not think so; therefore
as by the Heathen we may learn many good lessons, even so a man of
understanding may learn wisdom, and gain experience of a fool; I wrote not
this altogether to pleasure those that are skillful already, for this book can
steed them but little, for the whole and sound need not a Physician, but the
ignorant and unskillful may profit by this book as much if with discretion
they take regard in their practice according to my direction, as if my self
were in person to teach them, but both the skillful, and unskillful, the wise
and the foolish may here learn one lesson or other, which they never learned
before; yet I know not how every one will take this my presumption, in
aduenturing to set out a book having no learning, yet I pray you read it over
first, and then judge, but yet be slow in condemning me, for I have done my
good will, now he which can make a simple thing better, he ought so to handle
the matter, that although he get credit himself, yet condemn not me for
showing the best I could; therefore so judge of me behind my back as you
would have others judge of you, but if you judge well and like well of it, then
shall you have the second part with six weapons more, but I will first see what
will become of this first part, let it commend or condemn it self, for great
braggers cannot better it, nor dissembling specches impair it, neither will I
maintain for well done, all that I have done, but if you accept it then I have
all my desire, if otherwise good will shall bear the blame for my presumption:
but why do I make a dought of any evil speeches, which deserus no blame,
again this I know that there is none which stands in so much need of good
words as those which go about to cover dishonest deeds, wherefore I may say as
that great Captain Marius who having occasion to use a speech before the
people of Rome, in his conclusion he said, although my words are not well set
in order I weigh not so much so that my deeds be good.

I have made this of brick and stones, as Augustus said of Rome at the first,
but now Rome is built with marble: even so I would wish that some expert and
learned person or other would pull down this rude begun work of mine and
build it up with marble, for the work it self if it were workmanlike handled,
deserves to be written in leters of gold, and to remain for ever, but first it
must be twice or thrice distilled as they do their Rosasolis, for first it is
Aquavitae, and then in the second and third distillation, there is bestowed
greater charge and more excellent matter arises of it.

I have but roued at skill in weapons, yet I am sure that I have shot so near
the mark that some will account me for a good Archer, otherwise they would
never have been so important with me to have me put my directions in writing,
and when it was in writing so many desired Copies, that amongst so many friends
I knew not which to pleasure first, but especially and above all the late high
and mighty Prince Henry whom I well hoped that he should have lived to have
been the ninth Henry and the tenth worthy of the world, for what did any of
the other nine worthies do, but this good Prince was as likely, if he had
lived to have performed as much as any of them; for what has been done but
may be done again. But as I was about to say, this good Prince had the
perusing of this book and earnestly persuaded me to print it, but I had not
leisure to finish it before death untimely took him away to my grief and many
more, for all the whole kingdom was nothing but mourning. Death were kind if
he took none, but those which offended, but oh most unkind death, for thou in
taking away that good young Prince, have taken away him which never offended,
for there was never the like seen in one so young, for his wisdom, learning,
and kind courtesy, to all which came to see his Princely self, talking so
mildly and familiarly to every one which did so rejoice and glad the hearts of
all true and loving subjects, and also caused him in his fame to be spoken of,
for Kings and Princes are talked of at poor men's tables, and good words he
deserved, as ever any earthly creature did. For besides his skill in Music,
he was able by his learning to discourse with any foreign Prince whatsoever,
also his admirable and well riding of a great horse, and his excellent running
at tilt or ring; likewise his cunning in weapons, for the fight on horseback
or on foot, and for tossing the pike never so many feats seen in any Prince,
insomuch that it made strangers stand amazed to behold him; at a word he had
experience in all arts or sciences, thereby seeming as it were desirous to
trust more to his own valor, if occasion served, then to the goodness of his
horse. And so to make an end least of the ignorant I get the name of a
claw-blacke, and also another doubt I have, least undertaking so difficult a
task, and being not able to discharge it according unto the dignity and
worthiness thereof, the which I cannot do, and therefore I will not wade so
far in so dangerous a river, but that I may easily escape out, wherefore like
the finger of a dial I will point, it must be the clock which tells you the
just time of the day, I have drawn his Highness in bare colors, and so I
leave the oily colors unto those which are learned, you may see by a taste what
wine is in the butte, and so to our matter again. Now he which will practice
after my direction, thou may a little the rather attain unto that perfect
knowledge in the Art or skill with thy weapons having an able body by agility
to preserve that skill which I have here in this book laid open unto thee, for
I did understand many things which my body was not able to perform; now
because many at the first will wax weary in their practice, yet such
weariness is overcome by often exercise, and that new skill once obtained will
be such a pleasure to thee, Give not over practice nor reject not skill because
thou can not be a master of art, or a doctor at the first day, for time must
work and bring al things to pass, for that is well done which is done by
leisure, for have many times makes wast.
that it puts all weariness out of thy remembrance, now until thou have
skill thou must not think it a toil, but strive continually to overcome
weariness: resolve this with thy self, that the pain will be nothing so
wearisome as the gain of skill will be delightful and comfortable unto thee,
and commendable amongst others: I have made it as plain and laid it as open as
I can express by words, because I would have every man expert in weapons,
considering that skill in weapons is so honorable and so precious a thing,
that in my mind it may be preferred next unto divinity, for as divinity
prescrueth the souls of those which follow it, from hell and the devil, so
does this noble and worthy art of defense defend the body from hurts and skars
of those which learn it, but those which neither follow the one nor learn the
othet, the first fort for ought I know may go throw fire brands in hell, and
the second sort may sit in an alehouse, and there show how many hurts, and
likewise tell how many wounds he has about his body; for I have known wany
brag of their hurts, and in my conceit they take a pride In that they have
stood so near the point of a weapon, whereby to receive wounds, therefore they
are willing that the world should know how venturous they have been, but now in
my mind if they had skill they need not be hurt: wherefore skill is not only
available to preserve and keep the body without hurts and wounds, but also
the use and practice with weapon, does drive away all aches, griefs, and
diseases, it remooueth congealed blood, and breaks impostumes, it makes the
body nimble, and plyant, it sharpneth the wit, it increases the sight, and
procures strength, and expels melancholy and cholericknes, and many other
evil conceits, it keeps a man in breath, in perfect health, it makes him to
be of long life which uses it, it is unto him which has the perfect skill in
weapons, a most friendly, and comfortable companion, when he is alone, having
but only his weapons about him, it puts him out of all fear, and in the
wars and places of most danger it makes a man bold, hardy valiant, and
venturous. wherefore they that are once experienced in the skill of weapons
will afterward to the end of their lives enconrage the unskillful to learn
still, considering how necessary a thing skill in weapons is, insomuch that God
and nature tollerates the practice of this skill in weapons, which is here meant
for the defense of man's body, it also preserves many from murder, also in the
wars it may likewise stead a King, gentleman, or any other private soldier;
for if in the wars a single combat is desired, as that of Golias, there started
out of the army a David who with a godly valor stood in the gap, for the good
and preservation of many men's lives, which no doubt else had perished in that
great and dangerous battle. Therefore it behooves Kings being challenged by
their equals for the safeguard and good of their subjects and country, to
adventure and hazard their own lives in hope of a conquest, so that thereby
the wars may cease.

Some there are which take delight to talk of the art of defense, and yet
have no insight nor judgment therein, the proverb is verified in such which
goes thus, there are some which talk of Robin-hood which never shot in his
bow, I speak this because a gentleman on a time came to my School and would
not play by no means, yet he was busy with his tongue in teaching others, and
in discoursing of several weapons, and several guards, but by his words he
bewraied his small judgment, for his speech founded to no sense nor reason,
and so I being weary with hearing him talk so long, and far from the mark
which he aimed at, so at length I rounded him in the ear, thus, hold your
peace, or else speak softly, for my usher laughs you to skorne. But we will to
our matter again, and draw to a conclusion of this Epistle, for the necessary
use of weapons. In Luke the twelve there the Lord as it seems did think them
to be more better then a coat upon a man's back, he therefore bade his
Disciples generally, go said he, sell your coats and buy you swords, he spoke
not this to one of them alone, but unto them all.

Now the Kingly Prophet David teaches you where to wear your swords, saying
gird thy sword on thy thigh, he does not bid thee wear it about thy neck in
a string, even so as the Lord in many places of the Bible is said to be of many
professions, for he is called a shepherd, a husbandman, a Physician, and
David in his 144. Psalm, in a manner calls him a fenser, for there he faith
that the Lord did teach his hands to war, and his fingers to fight: He also
faith in another of his Psalms, I am a worm and no man, and yet I fear not
what man can do unto me. Other examples bending to this purpose hereafter
shall follow more at large, some in one Chapter, and some in another, as they
come in my mind, and although it has been my study and practice this twenty
years, yet now I have unfolded every place, and showed every wrinkle of these
few weapons, so far as my invention has attained unto, and I have set them
down so large and made them so plain, as by words I could any way express
them, so that thou may learn them in twenty days and less, if not all, yet
enough for the sure defense of thy body, and the rest shall follow in a second
book hereafter, if thou do friendly accept of this.

In the mean time arm thy mind to these weapons here following, for they are
sufficient for thy defense at single combat, also here thou shall find other
lessons no less profitable then delightful, if thou with content peruse them,
and so I will hinder thee no longer from that which ensues, and therefore
ending my Epistle with these words of the Friar, who often in his Sermon said
the best is behind, so he that reads but the beginning of a book, can give
no judgment of that which enueth; then read it over, and thou shall not be
deluded with the best is behind.

I hope I may call this book a book without any offense, for the collier he
calls his horse a horse, and the Spanish Iennet is but a horse. Now as this
art is called a Noble art, and not so named vnfittingly, being rightly
understood, for there is no art nor science more to be preferred before this,
for that there is none that iumpeth in equality, nor that matcheth in
singularity or that has so many sundry subtle devices and ingenious
inventions, as this noble art of defense has. Now he that does but read of
this art, yea although he read never so much, yet without practice and by
experience in trial, it will be imperfect, for how can perfection be attained
but by practice, and therefore it also behooves thee to use practice with
sundry men, and so to make use of the diversity of each man's skill, and then
for thy benefit, like the wise physician who of many simples makes one
compound, or as the be which by her serious industry gathers virtue from
sundry sorts of herbs and flowers, and thereof makes her honey, she is not
therefore to be condemned of envy, but rather to be commended of all.

Neither do I write this book altogether to profit those inlearning that
which they before wanted, but only to set them and other willing minds a work
which by art and learning can better swim through such a deep river then I
can, it should have been better if my learning had been answerable to my will,
yet hoping that the wise will rather wink at small faults, then rashly reprove
that which may profit the simple, for all have not skill and cunning alike, I
am persuaded that some will the rather pass it over with patience, although it
be but only for affection to the art, and so hoping that this my work may be
profitable to all, for so it can no way be hurtful to none, but if you chance
to meet with this book after he has served out the apprentiship of seven
years, if God grant me life so long you shall see him in double apparel, and
then you shall have just cause to say that his master has fulfilled his
covenants, for I wish all men well, and every one an increase of skill in all
laudable and profitable arts or sciences, and so with this long entry into a
little parlor, I leave you to him whose seat is in heaven, and whose
footstool is the earth. And rest,

Thine in the Lord, Joseph Swetnam.

Unto all Professors of the Noble and worthy Art of Defense I send greeting.
MOst noble brethren by profession, and brethren in Christ by Religion, wishing
all health and happiness to all them of the noble Art or Science of Defense; and
as your profession is noble, so in brotherly love, I do earnestly request you
all to use it in that noble fashion, as the name or title requires, the rather,
and for because you are men, not only noted and talked of, but often looked on
and more pointed at, then any other ordinary men are, of what profession
soever. Also it is the worlds wonder, to set a man of civil government using
this profession herefore I pray you consider with me alittle, that we are as a
Beacon set on a hill, or like a candle in a candlestick; then let not your
candle be made with a great wike, and no tallow, but let him be so mixed with
both, that your light may so shine before men, that they seeing your discreet
government and good behavior may (by your good examples) reform many ill
infirmities which they see in themselves. Alas, I pray you consider and
remember, that as the tree grows, so he falls; we are not borne for our
selves, but for our Country: and if we do no good, though we do no harm,
then better it were that we had never been borne. The fig tree in the
Gospel, is said to trouble the ground, because he bare no fruit, and
therefore better an addle Egg then an ill Bird; for a good and a godly life,
has a good and a godly end, and an ungodly life has an ungodly end: and
therefore most happy dies that man, of whom the world doubts not of his
salvation, although the world is given to speak well and charitably of the
wicked when they are dead, and yet it may be they think in their minds they
are gone to hell; then call to mind, and wisely consider of this, and also of
your end, and in what great ieopardie your lives stand; for he that to day is
well, lusty, and strong, may the next day, nay, the next hour, have his life
taken suddenly from him at unawares, when he least thinks on is, for many of
this profession do not live out half their days, for there is many ways to
bring a man to his end, some by quarrelling when they have no cause, and so are
stabbed suddenly, and some by drunkenness, as you shall hear anon; for I
could write of many which came to their ends, and yet died not all in their
beds, nor all in the wars, nor all at the gallows, and yet many of them
have gone these ways: for there are wicked and evil angels which are the
wayters, and do attend upon an ungodly life, for Death respects no manner of
person, for be does assault the skillful so well as the ignorant, the wise so
well as the foolish, and therefore it is good for every man to be prepared
and in a readiness, and then he need not to fear to say, Come Lord Jesus,
come quickly; to day or to morrow, or when thou will, and with what manner of
death soever, so it come by thine appointment.

And now (for examples sake) I think it not amiss to renew your remembrance
with the death of some few of the Noble Science, because I have known their
ends; and first, to begin with that one of master Turner, which should be
the last, he did not so speedily kill John Dun, with a thrust in the eye, but
he was as soon murdered afterward, with a shot of a Pistol; for neither
of them, after they had their deaths wound, spoke one word; lo, by this you
may see, that some hawks are but a flight, and some horses are killed with a
tournie, and a man is but a shot; but now, by reason that Master Turner, by
his unlucky hand, thrust out two or three eyes, and because none others are
known to do the like, it bath therefore bred an admiration in the ignorant
and vulgar sort, insomuch, that generally they do applaude him with this
commendation, saying that he has not left the like behind him, nor never
will be the like again: But this is a great error in thinking so, and far
deceived are they; for I well knew Master Turner by familiar acquaintance, and
therefore (to speak the right) he was a worthy fellow and deserved well, but
yet I know many which can go so near the eye as ever he could do, if they so
listed, as in this book you shall see many false thrusts at several weapons,
which may endanger any man's eyes, if those which learn them do carry envious
minds, or if they were desirous to work a man such a mischief, but God
forbid that any man should be so ill minded. I will not say, but that by
chance such a thing may be done, and so it may be that Master Turner did it
more by chance, without any intention; for so some do judge of it: but if a
man choppe a thrust at the face, yet, by chance, he may hit the eye: for no
man is certain, that with the first thrust he will hit the eye, but with
proffering many, by chance he may: now the use which we ought to make of this,
is, to advise all men to take heed that they bear not a killing heart, for
then we shall have no killing hand, as that example more of Henry Adlington for
killing his Master John Deuell, was hanged: Furlong he drunk a pint of Aqua
vitae at one draught, and he fell down and died presently: Westcoat, for some
unkindness received of his own daughter, he went into a wood near Perine in
Cornwall, and there hanged himself: Richard Caro, he died most miserably of
the French disease in an old house near Plimmouth, although he had a new
suite of clothes from top to toe, yet he was so loathsome a creature, that
no body would let him harbor in his house, for part of his body was rotten
and stuncke above ground: also old Carter of Worcester lay along time sick of
a lingering disease, and being worn away to nothing but skin and bones, he
died in his bed: and so of many more I could write, but it is not my intention
to write a Chronicle, and therefore these few shall serve for this time, I
wrote it but only to put you in mind, that you may so lead your lives daily
and hourly, as if Death were even at your heels, and so to live as though you
should live for ever, always keeping something for a rainie day, as says the
Proverb, that is to say, for sickness, if God do send it, and for old age
when your aching bones do refuse to perform that labor which the heart
willing to set them to.

Therefore I would wish every one, in his youth, to provide and get himself a
homely home, and to settle in one good town or other, for a rolling stone
gathers no Moss; the Grasshopper cannot live but in the grass, and the
Salamander dies if he go out of the fire: therefore, spend not thy time in
travel from place to place, but keep thy homely home, and there begin thy
pending as thou may continue, cutting thy coat according to thy cloth, and
not spending all at one time, and have nothing at an other to serve thy turn,
as many of all Profession do.

Wherefore, you young branches of this noble Art of Defense, of you I mean to
speak, and unto you I do make this earnest request, that you will bestow all
your idle time, which too too many spend in idle company, and in drunkenness,
such ill spent time, I could wish, that it were either bestowed in reading of
good books, or in giving good counsel unto such young men as do frequent your
company, teaching them besides skill with weapons, how to manage their weapons,
and how, and when to appoint the field, but not upon every drunken quarrel,
and chiefly of all, charging them from profaning the Sabbath day, drunkenness,
and all other vices belonging thereunto, which makes their white souls so
black as incks, stinking before God as it were the smoke of sulphur and
brimstone: and thus doing will purchase you, not only the love of God, but
likewise of all the world, and your good report will be in every man's mouth,
yea it will go before you in your trauells, like as with an Herald of Arms,
or else like a speedy Post, overtake you wheresoever you go, whereas on the
contrary side, those which do spend their days in drunkenness, and leading
their lives lasciuiously one misfortune or other happens unto them, either by
the loss of a limb, or by the loss of an eye, or by the loss of their lives.

For I have known many very skillful men not only of this Profession, but
likewise of others, which delight in ungodliness, drunkenness; and being put
to trial in their Art or Profession, they have received disgrace and lost the
day, and they afterward have thought that they made at good excuse, in saying
that they were in drink when they went about their business, and yet it may
be it was not so, but admit it was so, then is it mere madness, that any man
should be so foolish in taking too much drink when before hand he knows
this is the day, wherein I am to stand upon my credit; now because I know,
that many will read this besides those unto whom it is dedicated: therefore I
wish all men, of what Profession soever, to make this reckoning (as aforesaid)
every day, and not to be forgetful of that which he should chiefly remember;
for every day one time of the day or other thou may be put so to thy shifts,
and thereby have an occasion to sommon up all thy wits, and driven to use thy
best skill, and yet all little enough to serve thy turn.

Wherefore unto you which this any way may concern, I wish you to apply your
selves unto your Profession, and still to be studying and practicing the true
and perfect rules belonging both to the true and false play, especially unto
such weapons as you are not grown unto the full perfection before hand, if
they may serve either for the wars or for single combat.

Be not wise in thine own conceit, in thinking that thou have learned all the
skill which is possible to be learned already, far deceived art thou if thou
think so, for if thou live till thou art old, yet thou may learn still,
for one guard crosses another, and the false play crosses the true play;
there are many secret slippes and guards to be invented, and one guard or one
trick may more stead thee, and more prevail against some men then another;
for when with plain play, thou can not endanger thy enemy, yet with false
play thou may hit him, for although thy enemy do know the defense of some
manner of false play, yet it may be he is not acquainted, neither with the
defense nor offense of thine, for there it more ways to the wood then one, and
he which knows many ways, may go the nearest.

Even so, he that knows many guards, and the true skill at many weapons may
be the better able to answer any stowt bragging forreiner or stranger when
they come with their challenges into our country, let them be of what nation
soever, and at what weapons they will, and upon what terms they dare, as
hitherto they have been sufficiently answered during my time, by Master
Mathews, Master Turner, Master Bradshaw, and Master Yates; for these chiefly
stood to stake against all comers, and yet I can not choose but remember
Master Church, and Master Brentley, who of this latter time hane deserved to
be well reported of, and for aught that I could ever hear or see any get at
any of their hands, they have small cause to brag of their winning, for they
always went away with shrewd shrubs and knockes, I mean with black eyes,
broken shinnes, or cracked pates; but of my self I will say little, because the
world is sufficiently satisfied of more then at this time I mean to write of
now, although the ignorant can not answer them for want of skill and judgment,
yet they will rejoice and clap their hands to see them answered by sufficient
and able men of valor and judgment.

Now if any should ask my reason, why some should have such good fortune, and
other some disgraced, and yet by the worlds judgment their skill equal;
because you shall not must long about it, I will quickly tell you my opinion,
good government and good carriage is the maine point thereof, yet me thinks
amongst the vulgar sort I hear some say, because two or three famous fellows
are dead, that there will never be the like again: but far deceived are they
which think so, for there has not been so good, but there may come so good
again: for as yet I never knew any man but he has met with his match, and
therefore I wish every one not to presume one step the higher, for any gift
that God bestows on thee, neither to think thy self better then any man,
though there are some which, for want of discretion, will disable others, only
to magnify themselves, and thinking thereby to make the world believe there is
none so good as they. Lo, this is the cause of many quarrels, and sometimes
murders: Therefore speak not evil behind the back of any man, nor
dispraise no man's play nor workmanship, be it never so simple, do not like
other Tradesmen, which cannot live one by another, but with a kind of grudging
hatred, as the Hatter against the Hatter, the Shoemaker against the Shoemaker,
and the Tailer would even hang the Tailer by his good will, and so of all
Trades the like; but I would gladly wish it otherwise of all Trades, but
especially of this Profession, to be loving and kind one to another, meeting
together in their trauells, and like Birds of a feather hold together, and in
brotherly love embrace one another, and let it not be from the teeth outward,
but from the heart inward, for you shall have many others which will undermine
you, and creep into your secrets, and so run betwixt one another with
tattling tales, only to set you together by the ears, and then laugh at you
when they have done: Lo, thus an evil tongue is the cause of many a man's
death: wherefore leave and forsake all evil vices, though you fear not man in
respect of your manhood, yet fear to offend God for doubt of his judgments,
which undoubtedly lights upon all those that carelessly forget him.

For, as the greatest honor that ever came to man, was through skill in
weapons, and the greatest downe-fall that ever came to man, was through pride
of his manhood, and in neglecting his duty toward God: wherefore, as you
worthily carry the style or title of Masters of Defense by your Profession,
then be the same yon seem to be, I mean, never leave studying and practicing
till you come to the ground, and until you have sounded into the depth of your
Art, for there are many other principal points belonging to the wars,
besides, march, troop, charge, and stand; even so unto a Master of Defense
belongs the skill of many other weapons, besides backe-sword, sword and
dagger, rapier and dagger, and the staff: for, if he be not provided with
the skill of many other weapons, he may be to seek of his defense, if he
should be challenged unto some other weapons which he is unacquainted withal.

Then he is not worthy to be called a Master of Defense, which cannot defend
himself at all weapons, especially against every ordinary man not professing
the Art of Defense, nor except he can play with a Lion, as well as with a
Lamb, and sometimes again to play the Lamb so well as the Lion; for he that
can not tell when to spare, and when to strike; and he which cannot defend
himself, cannot teach others to defend themselves, nor is he not worthy to be
called a Master of Defense, but he that can do it is worthy of that title;
and therefore greatly wronged of them which will call such a one a Fencer, for
the difference betwixt a Master of Defense, and a Fencer, is as much as
between a Musician and a Fiddler, or betwixt a Merchant and a Peddler; it will
not well please a Merchant to be called Peddler, yet the Merchant sells the
like wares as the Peddler does: Is therefore a Merchant and a Peddler all one? No
more is every Fencer a Master of Defense; nor every Fiddler has not skill in
Pricke-song, and therefore no Musician; if a man have but ten shillings worth
of Pinnes, Points, and Inckle, he may then be called a Peddler, but he that
has a hundred sorts of wares, shall scarce get the name to be called a
Merchant, no more can he which has gotten a little more skill at three or
four weapons then every common man, yet he may be to seek of the true skill
of many other weapons which belong unto a Master of Defense.

Yet one thing more, which I had almost forgotten; unto Scholars and unto
Vshers of Schools of this Prosession, proffer no wrong to your Masters
neither in word nor deed, nor deny not your Tutors, but bear a hearty love
unto him which has brought you from nothing to something, from a shadow unto a
substance; Let not the Priest forget that he was a Clarke. I have known many
Scholars so good as their Master, and (it may be) better, according to the
Proverb, A man may make his own dog bite him; but in my mind, such a dog
is worthy of a rope: make the application as you see occasion. For I have
known many an ungrateful knave escape the gallows, by the means of an
honest minded man; yet such a knave (upon small or no occasion) has afterward
gone about to hang such a friend if he could, even so some young lusty
Scholars, when they have gotten perfect skill, for lack of wit, would offer
to wrong their aged Master, if they could: It is not strange to find one
scabbed sheep in a whole flock; nor it is no news amongst many honest men,
to find a treacherous varlet, void of all honesty, fear, and wit. Now
having no warrant to force you to follow my counsel, but only in brotherly
love, I thought good to request you, and every of you, to amend one; and God
amend us all, he I mean, whose Seat is in Heaven, and whose Foote-stoole is
the Earth.

Your well-willing friend, Joseph Swetnam.

This first Chapter shows what wepons are chiefly to he learned, with many
other principal notes worthy observation.
BECAUSE old weapons lies rusty in a corner, and every man is desirous of the
newest fashion of weapons, especially if they seem to be of more danger to
the enemy then the old, therefore it is my intent and purpose at this time to
express and set down both the true and false play principally of the rapier
and dagger, and staff, for I hold that the skill of these two weapons are
chiefly and necessary of every man to be learned, for to have the use of a
rapier to ride with, and a staff to walk a foot withal, for those which
have the skill of these two weapons may safely encounter against any man having
any other weapon whatsoever as hereafter you shall be sufficiently satisfied.

But first a word by the way in commendations of those two weapons, this I can
say and by good experience I speak it, that he which has a rapier and a close
hilted dagger, and skill withal to use him has great ods against the sword
and dagger, or sword and buckler, and the like I do affirm of a staff
against all long weapons; my reasons shall follow anon; but first I will speak
more in commendations of the rapier and dagger, note it well, for it is the
finest and the comeliest weapon that ever was used in England, for so much
cunning to this weapon belongs as to no weapon the like: wherefore I would
wish all gentlemen and others, not only to learn the true and perfect skill
thereof, but also to practice it often. For there is no exercise in the world
so healthful to the body, and the skill of it a sure defense for the same,
likewise it also behooves every man to be well instructed in this weapon, the
rather, and for because it is a weapon which for the most part all outlandish
men do use; wherefore being unprepared thou may be the better able to answer
them at their own weapon either in single combat or otherwise, but if thou
delay thy practice till thou have need, then I say at the very time of need it
will be too late, and little available to thee, for being learned in such
haste it is soon forgotten, and he which never learned, but does trust to his
own cunning may soon lose his life, for there is but two ways for the doing
of every thing; that is to say either a good or a bad, and commonly by nature
every man has the worst way; both at this exercise and so at all others the
like, but the best way being learned, by a little practice keeps it so
perfect, that it is never forgotten again.

A Physician is but little regarded, but in the time of sickness, even so the
practicing of skill is not remembered until a man has need to use it. Plato
was a Divine, yet he so highly esteemed the art or skill in weapons, insomuch
that he commands that children should learn so soon as they are able, and
Cyrus says that skill in weapons was as necessary as husbandry; but now when
you have the true and perfect skill, be not over rash nor take not exceptions
at every light occasion, but only by good advise to use it, in cases of
necessity; revenge not every small wrong, nor quarrel not upon every light
occasion, for the strongest and the richest man that is, must pocket up an
injury at sometimes, He that to wrath and anger is thrall, over his wits has
no power at all.
then be not hasty in thy wrath, but pause although thy weapon be drawn, for
the thrust being given, and the blow once fallen, it will be too late then to
repent; wherefore be vanant, but yet not too venturous, so fight as thou may
fight again, for the hasty man never wants woe, and he which will quarrel
for a small matter trusting unto his own manhood, yet for all his skill and
courage, may oftentimes meet with his match, and so carry away the blows with
dishonor.

A quarrel is oftentimes begun without discretion.
For a small or a bad quarrel has many times ill success, therefore let thy
quarrel be grounded upon a good foundation, for then it half defends it
self, but if it be upon drink or in defense of a lewd woman, such quarrels
are naught, and have ill success; again have this care, never be proud of thy
skill, but go as if thou had it not, except occasion serve: but be not
lifted up with a proud mind one step the higher, for courtesy wins favor with
all men; wherefore all way so frame your speech and answers, that there never
grow any quarrel upon a foolish word or a froward answer.

And furthermore, have this skill in thy memory, so rule thy tongue as never to
speak ill, whether it be true or false behind the back of any man, for if
the party spoken of be not in presence, yet he may hear of it, and thou may
be called in question for the same when thou think least upon it, yea
although thou suppose that thou speak it to thy friend, for I have known
many which to magnify themselves would boast and brag of their own manhood,
and disable others, which were far better men then themselves; thinking never
to hear of it again; but this one folly has been the cause of many
quarrels, and thereof springs deadly hatred, and sometimes murders. Yet I
do advise all men if indiscreet words do pass from the mouth of the simple
for lack of wit (but I will not say for lack of drink) but whether it be
drink or mere foolishness, revenge not every wrong, but first consider the
worth and quality of the party which has wronged thee, for if he be a
desperate person, or one which has nothing to loose, nor wife nor children to
care for, some such there are that are desperate, and care not if they were out
of the world, Be valiant but not to venturous.
as our proverb says, hab or nab, fall back fall edge, they care not whose
house is on sire, for they have nothing to loose, now although thou have the
perfect skill with thy weapons, yet sight not with such raskalls, not with none
upon every small wrong; for so thou may be accounted careless and bloody
minded, as though Mars the God of battle were thy father, or thinking thy
self to be more mighty then Hercules, or as one altogether forgetting that
which so often has been seen, that a little wretch of stature by skill,
judgment, and reason, As that of David he overcame great Gollas.
has subdued and overcome a far more mightier man of person than himself.

For he that is well instructed in the perfect skill with his weapon although
but small of stature, and weak of strength, may with a little moving of his
foot or a sudden turning of his hand, or with the quick agility of his body
kill and bring to the ground the tall and strongest man that is.

Forget not this lesson.
Now before thou go into the field to fight, first of all put God before, and
use thy devotion to him privately, and commit thy self wholly to his mercy,
because he redeemed thee, and the victory lies in him, if thy skill and
cunning were never so good; for if thou go with a sure hope and trust in God,
Fear not if thou have skill to answer a good quarrel for its better die like a
house in battle then live like a hog in a stie.
and thy quarrel good, and some skill withal, then fight and fear not, and
although at the first it will be fearful to most men, being but once
experienced therein, it will encourage and make a man bold, yet take this by
the way, and note it well, for skill makes some men toward, for if thou
learnest the best skill thou can, and in a fence school meetest with one
that is so good, and cunning as thy self, such a one will hit thee sometimes in
spite of thy teeth, the which hit makes some think with themselves, I did now
lie in as sure a guard as I could for my life, and yet if I had been in the
field this hit might have killed me.

But I say there is great ods betwixt fighting in the field and playing in a
fence-schoole, for in the field being both sober, I mean if it be in a morning
upon cold blood, then every man will as much fear to kill as to be killed,
again a man shall see to defend either blow or thrust in the field then in a
fence-schoole, for a man will be more bold with a foil or a cudgel, because
there is small danger in either of them.

But when they come to tell their tale at the point of a rapier, they will
stand off for their own safety; go not into the field in the afternoon,
partly for the avoiding of the common speech of those which will say it is a
drunken match, neither go not presently upon the sudden falling out; for
choler overcomes the wits of many a man, for in a mad fury skill is little
thought upon, and therefore very dangerous to both; for although thy memory
serve thee well; and so thou being careful and not bearing any mind to kill,
yet thy enemy if he be but a rank coward, upon drink or fury, or upon hot
blood, will be so desperate, that if you favor him he will endanger thee.

There is seldom or never any quarrel begun but in an afternoon, for then
commonly the drink is in and the wit is out, although thou know thy self
in good case, and not to have received more drink then to suffice thy want,
yet do thou not know how little drink will overcome the wits of another man;
and this I know, and by good experience I speak it, there is no ods during the
time betwixt a mad man and a drunkard.

Never jest with edge tools, nor play not the fool with thy weapons, but
keep them to defend thy self when occasion shall require thee, or at such
time as thou shall be oppressed, for many hurts and much mischief has been
done by overmuch folly in jesting with weapons, when at the beginning there
was no harm meant.

Ever refer the quarrel to be tried in the morning, for then thy adversary so
well as thy self being in cold blood, skill avails, and he which the night
before would seem to fight with the devil, will in the morning be as cold as
a clock; for then it is the nature of every man as well to fear to kill, as
to be killed, and so thou by skill may fight long without danger, and sight
with many, and have no hurt.

(...)
When thou go into the field, note the Sun, for if it do thine, it may
annoy thee; but get thy back toward the Sun, and so trauerse the ground,
that thine enemy get not about thee, so shall thou always keep his face in
the Sun, which will so annoy him, that he can not make play to endanger
thee. But if there be no Sun to trouble thee, then make choice of the lowest
ground, for he which has the lowest ground, has the greatest advantage. Also
take heed that thou strike not with thy rapier, for so thou may break it,
and bring thy self to thine enemies mercy, and it may be he will take the
advantage of thee: If thy rapier fall out of thy hand, take thy dagger by the
point, and make an offer to throw it, for that will so dare thine enemy, that
he will stand until thou have taken up thy weapon again.

Take heed of (...).
But if thou recover thine enemies weapons, (as I have known many let fall
their weapons in fight) give it not to him again; if thou mean to fight with
him any more for that time; for, to unarm thy enemy, is more credit to thee,
then to kill him. Never lend a weapon to sight against thy self, for these two
follies have been the end of many good men's lives: if thine enemy fall, hurt
him, if he will not yield up his weapon, but kill him not, though his life do
lie in thine hands, but if thou spare him, sight with him no more for that
time; for I have known many that might first have killed, but by sparing their
enemies, have been killed themselves; if thine enemies weapon break, then
there is favor to be showed: but these two last points are to be conditioned
upon. When any two Gentlemen, or other, whatsoever, shall have occasion to
fight, yet it is not amiss, at their meeting in the field, for the one of them
to say before they begin, Show me that favor which thou would have thy
self, that is, if I fall, or my weapon break, stay thy hands, and I will do
the like. Have always as great care to save the life of thy enemy as of thine
own, fearing more the Judgments of God, then the Laws of the Realm.
Likewise, never be too earnest in persuading a coward to go with thee into the
field to fight; for I have known a Gull that would abuse a man in words
behind his back, but when he has been called to account for it, by the
party grieved, he durst not answer him in the field, yet by earnest
provoking, has gone and put a far better man then himself to the worst.

Therefore I hold it very unfortunate to persuade any man too too earnestly, to
go into the field to fight against his will; neither go into the field with
every rascal, for thou do hazard thy self, and gettest no credit,
wherefore, if such a one do challenge thee, if thou can conveniently, break
his pate, for he is worthy of somewhat for his forwardnes, but to answer him
otherwise, let this excuse privilege thee; say thou scornest to do him that
credit. Let thy rapier be of a reasonable length, rather too long then too
short, four foot at the least, except thine enemy do give or send thee the
length of his weapon; then it is a point of manhood to match him as near as
thou can: always let thine enemy tell his tale at the point of thy weapon;
but trust him not to whisper with thee, lest he shall stabbe thee, or else by
strength recover thy own weapon, and so do thee a mischief before thou be
aware; keep clean thy rapier; remember that of Alexander, how he cassiered a
Soldier out of his Army, because he was making clean of his Armor, even then
when he should have used it. Likewise there is a Proverb, A workman is known
by his tools: Then if thou have skill to use thy weapons, let it appear by
the cleanly keeping of them, then leave not thy rapier in a wet scabbard, when
thou come to thy iournies end.

Yet once more I do advise all men to take heed how they jest or show their
tricks in travel in their Chambers with their weapons, no though the scabbard
be on; for by such foolish ieasting I have known much mischief done, and
sometimes murder, when there was no hurt meant at all; therefore I do wish the
wiser to rule the other, so that a mischief may be prevented before it be
done, for else repentance may come too late. Also in playing with sticks,
without buttons, many (for want of skill) may loose an eye, as many have done
heretofore. Many a man will say, That skill in weapons is good, and one of the
principallest things that belongs to a man, yet themselves altogether
unskillful; in their youth they think it too soon to learn, and in age too
late, yet when they are wronged, they would give any thing, that they were able
to answer their enemy without fear or hurt, as he which is skillful in his
weapon may do.

For it happens in an hour which happens not in seven years.
Go not into the field with one that is known to be a common drunkard, no
though thou take him never so sober, for if thou chance to hurt him, the vulgar
sort will deem that he was drunk, so thou do hazard thy life, and get no
credit, then take no exceptions at a Drunkards words, for what he speaks is
not regarded amongst men of discretion, yet many times it so falls out, that
a drunken madde-braine meets with a prodigal unwise fellow, and they do
quickly upon a word, nay upon a look, make a sudden brawle, to the
disturbance of the rest of the company; for he that will match a crooked
dagger with a crooked sheathe, in seeking may find one; even so he that is
given to swaggering and quarrelling, does meet with his match sometimes, nay
very often it so falls out.

Also he is unwise which will begin a quarrel in a School of Defense, upon
the taking of a knock, as many do; for a man plays, either to give a knock,
or to take a knock: but with skill a man may play a long time, and do neither
of them, except their fury do overcome their wits; but he which cannot arm
himself with patience, by considering with himself the danger of his rashness;
let him spend all his idle time in practicing in weapons, with one that is
skillful; for by use of play, many a man comes to know the danger of
rashness, and so with a due consideration, do thereby come to mittigate their
furious affection, whereas an other sort of harebraines (upon very small
occasion) will be always ready, not only to breed, but also to maintain
any idle quarrel, whether it be right or wrong, in Fair or Market, Fence
school or Tavern, as many witless drunkards do; for skill without
discretion makes some more forward and desperate in maintaining idle quarrels,
then otherwise they would be, whereas a man of discretion and government will
be no whit the prouder of skill, but go as if he had it not, and amongst wise
men he is accounted most valiant which brags least, and is master of himself,
in conquering his affections, and always fore-casting the worst, before a
mischief does happen; for a common quarreller is like a common hackny, which
is never without a galled back; even so a quarreller is seldom without hurts:
let thy hands be slower then thy tongue, yet let not thy sword rust for want of
use, nor yet surfeit with blood, but after many threats in place convenient
vnsheathe thy sword, but yet do it with an unwilling kind of willingness, as not
being too prodigal of thy blond in mis-spending it idly, and yet grudge it
nor when occasion shall serve, either for thy King and Country, or in defense
of thine own reputation, but not in every rascally brawle, nor in a great
assembly, where many times a foolish mad-braine, will draw his weapon upon an
idle quarrel; in such a place I have known, that after one has drawn, many
have likewise drawn their weapons for company, according to the old Proverb,
One fool makes many: But howsoever, in such a case I have known much
mischief quickly done, although many of them have not known the cause, nor
whom to strike, until it has been too late; but then when all is done, these
great fighters, when it is too late, they would make inquiry how the quarrel
began, and upon what occasion; but men of discretion and wisdom would
examine the cause first, before they do vnsheathe their weapon: for in my
mind, he that undertakes such quarrels, shows neither manhood, wit, nor
valor, and contrary unto all the Laws of Arms; yet I will not say, but,
where much people are, a man that means no harm, may be wronged; but there
is no wisdom to right himself in a multitude: for fear of a mutiny, I mean
in setting many together by the ears, but in a place convenient thou may
call him in question which wronged thee before, examining the cause of the
quarrel, when the heat is past; and then if you find it but a pelting
quarrel, being wisely considered upon, and that it has been no great
scandal unto thy good name and credit, partly, because the match was made,
and the field was appointed in a drunken humor, in such a case I say, it were
a very wise part, for the one of them to make a friend acquainted, which by
wisdom may end the quarrel, before a further mischief be done: Nay more, I
have known as good a man as ever did draw sword, upon an idle quarrel, has
himself gone the next morning to the house of his adversary, not making any
friend at all acquainted with the business, and he has thus said; I am come to
answer what the last night I promised, but yet withal, to tell thee, that our
quarrel is but small, and began upon idleness, yea so small, that I am
loath to have it come into the ears of wise men, left they should account us
both fools: now, for the avoiding of this and other dangers, it is not amiss
for the wiser to offer this reasonable composition, though we do think him
too weak for thee, for then thy credit will be the less in fighting with
him, and yet if thou do kill him, the danger is as great toward thee, as if
thou did kill the best man in the world: now on the other side, say he is a
man noted and known to be as sufficient a man as ever drew sword; then I say,
if an honest end can be made, without fighting, that is the best way. For if
two men of war meet at Sea, they will not fight willingly one with the
other, for they will consider before hand, that there is little else then
blows to be gotten one of the other: wherefore, if you be persuaded to end it
with a boll of Wine, be not froward but yield unto reason, if no friends know
of the quarrel, then (as I said before) the wiser of the two may say unto the
other; Come, let us go and drink our selves friends, let us take a hair of
the same dog, which the last night did bite us, and made us mad, shall now
cure us and make us whole; and so let us smother up this pelting quarrel.

But now, if the other be froward, and will not accept of thy reasonable
motion, but will needs end it with weapons, then, rather then show thy back to
thy spiteful enemy, let him see thy heart blood: I mean, if he can get it,
but there is no such danger in fight, except Skill and Discretion be wanting:
wherefore rowze up thy spirit, and what thou undertake, do it without
rashness, and yet perform it without fear always; in a good quarrel, if
thou be overcome, let thy heart yield last of all; and if thine enemy be not
too rash upon thee, it is a sufficient conquest, that when thou might hurt
or kill, yet do it not, but still wear Patience to the hard back, for by such
victory thou workest thine own peace; and he that thus does, gets himself
credit.

If the peacemakers are said to be blessed, then the quarrellers and make-bates
are accursed.
As there are many men, so they are of many minds, for some will be satisfied
with words, and some must needs be answered with weapons, and some are never
well full nor fasting; therefore I would have every man fitly armed for his
defense, what company soever he keep, let him be armed with patience, still a
fair tongue, We must not seek revenge one of an other, because the Lord says
Revenge is mine.
and a good weapon: so that if one will not serve, another must, rough or
smoothe, as occasion serves: for some are like unto nettles, which if thou
handle tenderly, it will sting thee, but if thou gripe it hard, thou shall have
no harm: even so, if thou give unto some men never so mild and gentle words,
yet will they not be persuaded, but they will the rather deem that thou
fear them, and so domineere the more upon thee: but yet for all that, they
are the children of God which desire peace, for the Prophet David says, I
seek peace, but when I speak thereof, they are bent to wane, Psalm. 120.7.
Again, there are many reasons to persuade one Christian not to fight with
another. First, the King and Council, have, and still do make strait Laws,
for the keeping of peace and for preventing of murders; but above all, God
expressly commands to the contrary, and if thou will not obey man, yet fear
the displeasure of Almighty God above all.

Consider then and meditate thus with thy self before thou pass thy word to
meet any man in the field, why should I go into the field, for when thou
come there thou must not kill, for if thou do, thou must look to answer
it before that great and fearful Judge which is the Judge of all Judges:
howsoever thou by friendship or by pity do escape the hands of the Judge in
this life: Besides, thou do loose thy goods, which thy wife and thy
children should possess. Again, when thou come into the field, and there
calling to mind these dangers before spoken of, and so forbearing as being
loath to kill: Then thy enemy, by sparing him, may kill thee, and so thou
perish in thy sins, having small or no time of repentance, and so thy death
will be doubtful, except thou did lead a very upright life before, which
may very well be doubted: for if thou did serve God aright, or fear his
judgments, then thou would not for any cause fight with thy brother.

Concerning this there is an excellent example of Patience showed by King
David, in the second of Samuel 16.6.10. David being in the midst of his Army,
there came a fellow with cursing and railing speeches, saying unto him, Come
out thou murderer, and withal, threw stones and dust at him: and one of the
servants of David said unto his Master, Shall I go and take off the head of
this Rayler? But David very wisely and mildely answered his Servant thus, It
may be that the Lord has sent him, and therefore let him alone: but now we
have a saying, That flesh and blood cannot endure such injuries as here you
see David did. But I say, those that will go to Heaven, must not look to be
carried thither in a feather-bed, but by enduring injuries, crossings,
vexations, and tribulations: O then think on Heaven, and yet forget not Hell,
presume not, nor yet despair not; live to die, and yet die to live: Oh then
lead thy life in true humility, for so shall thou undoubtedly escape Hels
damnation, and enjoy Heavens everlasting salvation; which place the God of gods
vouchsafe us all.

CHAP. II. Declaring the difference of sundry men's teaching, with a direction
for the entrance into the practice with thy weapons.
AS men of all arts trades and sciences, differ in art and workmanship, (as
for example) all Physicians do not use one kind of purgation, nor all Surgions
one manner of salve, nor al writers write not alike, but to make a rehearsal
of all arts it were too long, my meaning is so many men so many minds, even
so in this art of defense as the number which are experienced in it is
infinite, even so several fashions do exceed the number of infinite, if it
were possible; for every man holds his opinion to be best in that fashion
which he has been most used unto; although a man show them many errors by
good judgment, yet it is as hard to withdraw them from their own will as it is
to compel a Papist from his religion, which he has been always trained up
unto.

But the true skill of weapons once perfectly learned is never forgotten again,
for if any man were to fight for his life, as by a familiar example I will tell
you of those which have been unskillful, yet have had a sudden occasion to
use their weapons, and even then suddenly summoning up their wits, what defense
they should use for the safeguard of their lives, being so suddenly charged,
does not he then as I said remember himself of the best defense, or the best
trick, that ever was showed him, for then is the time to stand him in stead,
and then will use it, although he never played nor never practiced in seven
years before.

Nay further, he which never learned one trick but what nature bestowed, nor
never had any other experience use nor practice at one weapon nor other, but
only what he has seen of others, by chance, where he has happened to come:
yet such a one upon a present occasion being urged thereunto, will instantly
call to mind that such a time and such a time, I did see such a man fight or
play, and he was accounted a very good player, or a very tall man of his hands,
and thus he lay or thus he defended himself; Lo thus imitating for their
defense that which they have seen others do before, another example which by
experience I can speak of, and that is of some which never did nor never could
swim in all their lives, yet such at sometimes have been in danger of drowning,
by chance falling over board into the sea, or into other deep Rivers, where
there was no hope of life but only by swimming, such I say being put to their
shifts, have remembered themselves in the water, and so by laboring themselves I
mean with their hands and their feet, so have escaped and saved their lives.
Now I say if every man before hand were grounded in skill with his weapons, and
in the art of swimming when they were young, then would either of them be the
less fearful, for what is bred in the bone, will never out of the flesh.

Yet here one example more; take a young plant, and set him, and come again
within a month, and you may pull him up with ease, but let him grow a year or
two and he will be so deep rooted in the ground, so that you cannot pull him
up for your heart, except you use other means; even so of youth, if they give
their minds to good and laudable exercises when they are young, it were great
pity that they should want encouragement, whereby it might take root; but if
their minds be given to any idle or bad exercises, it were good then that it
were pulled up in time, before it have taken any deep root. And so I will here
leave off, because I shall have occasion hereafter to speak concerning those
matters.

CHAP. III. Fearful examples of murder, with advise to avoid murder.
GEnerally three sorts of men are hated for the most part, and very much
abhorred, that is to say, the proud minded man, a coward, and a murderer, but
especially a murderer, howsoever it be done: therefore most unhappy is he
which kills a man cowardly, in a desperate humor, but if he do it in his
own defense, or in a morning upon a just quarrel in the field, and both being
equally matched, then it may be the better tolerated both before God and man,
yet I do not well to say so, for Romans the 9. it is said, what art thou which
do dispute with God, then why go I about to make my toleration in murder,
when God has given us an express commandment to the contrary, saying; thou
shall not kill. Exodus 20. According to this saying, In no case commit not
murder.
he which strikes with the sword, shall perish with the sword, and likewise S.
Paul gives us a good lesson saving, do nothing without foresight and
judgment. Because I touch divinity in many places of my book, no doubt some
will say what should fencers meddle with divinity; but to answer you again,
every Christian ought to know the word, (indeed the sword is good) but much the
better when they go both together. But to our matter again: those which fear
God, and by chance happen into the company of a murderer, there hair will
stare, and their blood will rise, that they will inwardly wish they were out of
his company again, for many simple men do fear a murderer ever after they
have once known him to commit a murder, yet diverse honest men do by chance
happen into a murderers company, when they would be glad to shift themselves
from him again; or as were to spue him out of their presence, in regard of his
evil qualities, which is quarrelling, and taking exceptions upon any little
occasion. If any man also do seem to contrary a murderer, or a little cross
him in his swaggering, he will forthwith break out into these or such like
ungodly speeches, saying; I have killed a far better man than thy self; such
like words will he say with a brazen face, and a stony heart, lifted up with
the pride of his manhood: for he that is a murderer does think that he is the
best man in the world, especially if he escape the gallows so long, until he
has killed two or three men: I have been my self in company with many of
them, Oh remember how the curse of God fell upon Cain for murder.
but I did never see any fruit of repentance in them; for when they have past
the hands of the pitiful Judge, then they think that they are cleared for
ever, as well in this world as in the world to come; and then will they say if
they did offend, they had the Law for it; but I know not how so many of them
escape the gallows: there is a Proverb says, foolish pity overthrows
town and City. I think and am verily persuaded, that a murderer is accursed
and hated both of God and man, yea I am also persuaded that the house is
accursed wherein they dwell, and the ship wherein they sail at sea, mark their
end, and you shall see that although they pass the hands of men, yet God
persues them with the hue and cry of his vengeance, which follows them, and
apprehends them, and brings some of them to one kind of death, and some to
another; as these few examples following shall declare, and thou may consider
of them to thy benefit.

First Sir John Fitz: how wickedly and how cowardly did bewith two or three of
his men pursue and overtake Master Stannell, as he was riding from Testok in
Devonshire, toward his own house, this Master Stannell was beloved both of
rich and poor, he was a good and bountiful housekeeper, and his untimely
death was lamented of thousands, the occasion of the quarrel, was as I have
heard because Master Stannell called Sir John Fitz. Tenant, for that sir John
Fitz his father hid used to pay him a matter of two shillings a year: this was
no great cause of quarrel if it had been weighed in the balance of discretion,
considering the great love and familiarity which had continued long time
betwixt them, the which also was the reason that Master Stannell had not of
long time demanded the rent, nor did make any reckoning or account of it. But
then both having appointed to meet at a merry making in Testok only to be
merry, and there this unfortunate word tenant proceeded out of Master Stannels
mouth, which sit John took in very great choler, Master Sannell perceiving
that he had moved him betook himself presently to his horse, and riding
homewards having but only his footman with him, before he had rode two miles,
sir John Fitz with two or three of his men, being well horst ouer-tooke Master
Stannell and there compassing him about some before him and some behind him,
most cowardly and desperately murdered him; and upon that sir John fled into
France, but before one year was past his friends procured a pardon for him,
insomuch that he came home again, and to every man's seeming was at quiet, but
the hue and cry of Gods vengeance was in his conscience, and three or four
years after upon London way there apprehended him, as you shall hear; for
then and there most cruelly and diuelishly he killed his host, which was a
very honest man, and afterward most desperately with his own hands took his
rapier and murdered himself; yet thus much I can say of sir John Fitz he was a
proper man, and for the space of thirty years he lived orderly, to the guess
of the world, for he was well beloved in his country, and if he had so
continued to the end, it had been well, but what should I say, a man may be an
honest man thirty years, yea forty years, and yet be a knave at the last.

Another example was that of one Hocket of Pitmouth, who looking out at a
window, and espying one Captain Robinson coming down the street, and he
having an old quarrel to the said Robinson which began at sea, this Hocket
stepped to his door with his rapier ready drawn, and standing within his own
house until Captain Robinson was come just against his door, he there without
speaking one word ran him through with his rapier, and afterward was cleared
by the Judge of this world, but after his coming out of the gayle, he went to
sea, Master in a man of war, and within ten days after he was gone from
Plimoth to sea, the first ship they met withal shot but one shot, and yet
killed this Hocket, and no man in the ship killed nor hurt but only this
murderer.

Likewise in Plimoth one Captain Treherne and Captain Egles fell out about
nothing in a manner, the cause was for that one of them was denied lodging,
where the other did lie by the good wife of the house, for it may be she
affected the one better then the other, and two dogs and one bone commonly can
never agree well together, but they fell out about such a trifling matter, and
at the door in the street they fought, and in the first bout, Treherne was
down in the gutter, and Eagles there in presence of many might have killed
him, but stayed his hand, and suffered him to rise again, but then Trehearne
assaulted Captain Eagles most furiously, and it so chanced that with a blow
Eagles rapier brake, and then running into a house to save himself, Traherne
run him into the back and killed him, and afterward he received his trial
for it, but by the mercy of the Judge he was discharged of that matter. After
his coming out of the gayle, he presently got a crew of twenty eight persons,
and a ship, and went a rouing upon the coast of France, where they were all
taken, and every man of them hanged in France, now I do verily persuade my
self that many of them might have been living at this day, if they had not
happened into this murderers company.

Also, one Bartlet, who appointed the field with an other, after one bout, his
enemy requested him to hold his hands, that he might breathe, which he
consented unto; but as they both stood still, this Bartlet suddenly charged
his weapon upon the other, and ran him through, that he died presently, and
then Bartlet fled and escaped away for the space of seven years, but the huy
and cry of Gods vengeance followed him, insomuch, that he came again to
Plymouth of his own accord, thinking that all was well, and forgotten; but
there he was apprehended, and after the law had had his course upon him, Gods
vengeance left him not, but brought him to Plymouth again, and shortly after,
another did challenge this Bartlet, they both met in the field, and there was
Bartlet killed, not far from the place where he had killed the other before,
and he that killed him, fled away, and is not taken as yet.

Now, Remember this example.
to end these examples with the lamentablest history that ever pen did
write, for a more cruel murder was never committed, of king Richard the
third, in the Chronicles, If this make not your ears tingle, yet it may make
your heart; tremble.
there may you read it more at large, that after he had committed his
brothers two children to the Tower, he was not contented, but would have the
lives of these poor Infants, the doers of this hellish and cruel murder, were
sir James Tirrell, Miles Forest, and John Dighton, these three laying their
heads together, what manner of execution were best to be used in that Tragedy,
Fearful visions do haunt a murderer.
they concluded in the end, to stifle them in their beds in the dead time of
the night, and so with the clothes and pillowes which were about them, these
three murderers pressing them down under the clothes (as aforesaid) bereaved
them quickly of their lives, now, after this, what a hellish horror had this
King in his conscience, yea it so vexed and tormented his spirits, that he was
never well nor at quiet sleeping nor waking; for in the night he would
suddenly start out of his bed, and go up and down the Chamber like a mad
man; likewise in the day he never thought himself sure, but always feared
treasons, his eyes rolling continually about him, and oftentimes he would
clappe his hand upon his dagger, when there was no need, and afterward he was
vanquished with his enemies; and on the other three God showed his vengeance
somewhat in this world. For Sir James Tirrell was beheaded afterward at the
Tower for treason, but not for that matter; and Miles Forest had a consuming
and a lingering life, for his flesh did rotte away by peece-meale, and so
miserably died; John Dighton lived in great hatred, and was abhorred and
pointed at of all that knew him, and at the last died in great poverty and
misery. But I refer you unto the Chronicle, as aforesaid, which declares it
more at large: and so I will go on a little further to the same effect.

Though the Law do spare and not cut off a murderer so soon as he has
deserved death; yet I say the horror of his murdering conscience will so be
gnawing at his bloody heart, until it has eaten and consumed him to nothing;
also the horrible pains of hell will by visions show, and so plainly appear
unto him, still sounding in his ears such a peale, that he many times will
think that the devil is come from hell; for so long as he lives, his
spirits will be so distempered and affrighted, that in the night, many times
several visions will appear, sometimes spirits with ugly shapes, and
sometimes a multitude of weaponed Officers russeling in to apprehend him, and
sometimes the ghost of him which was murdered, insomuch that many times he
will sweat for fear, with running, laboring, and striving to keep himself
out of their gripe, and in a word, afraid he will be (in a manner) of every
grass; and whereas before he was accounted for a merry companion, is now
overcome with wild looks and melancholy thoughts, taking no joy, in wealth,
wife, and children. Lo, this is a life, but it is as wearisome as hell until
death does catch him, for death waits upon a murderer as a halter does upon
the stealer; as for example of sir John Gilbert ever after the killing of sir
John Burrowes, of which the world says it was an honorable quarrel, and yet
in the night his friends reported, that he would suddenly start out of his
bed, being sore affrighted, he knew not at what, he lived not many years
after, but yet died in his bed; so likewise master Hely killed captain
Foscue upon a sudden quarrel, meeting in the street in Plimmouth, yet, by the
course of the Law, was acquitted for it; but afterward, so long as he lived,
he lived a discontented life, and was never well in his conscience until
death took him. Now all these were but young men, and in the midst of their
years, to the eye of the world, either of them might have lived many years
longer, and yet not have been accounted for old men.

I could spend much paper and time with a number of examples touching this
matter, but I will here conclude, and leave the rest to thy daily experience,
which thine ears may hear, and thine eyes daily see (almost in every place)
far more fearful examples, concerning this former matter, the more is the
pity; but what becomes of them after this life is ended may seem doubtful,
but I leave that to the secret wisdom and power of Almighty God; but there
is no question to be made of those which lead a wicked and ungodly life, but
they shall have a wicked and an ungodly end; as on the contrary side, those
that lead a godly and an upright life, shall make a good and godly end: for if
a man do well, he shall have well, but if he do ill, he shall have ill. More
concerning this matter you may read toward the end of the eight chapter
following.

But I think it not amiss, here in this place, to show you alitle concerning
murders done in secret; for as the Proverb goes; Murder will not be hid;
albeit for a time God does suffer a murderer to live and reign without
apprehension, yet in the end he makes the devil bring forth his servant, to
receive his wages with shame enough, a murder can not be kept still close: for
the Lord sometimes does bring a murder to light that has been done in
secret, by the birds of the air, by water, by fire, by dogs, as in brief by
these examples shall plainly be demonstrated.

It has been known that a murdered carcass has been thrown into the Sea
when it was flowed to the full, thereby thinking, that with the ebb he would
have been carried away, but the water being gone, the murdered carcass was
found where it was first thrown in.

Also, I knew a woman that was arraigned and condemned, for murdering her
child, and well she deserved the same; for she cut the child into small
pieces, and then she took and threw them under a hot furnace where she was a
brewing: but when she had done brewing, and the fire out, there was found the
pieces of the child in the ashes, so fresh (in a manner) as it was thrown in.

Likewise, in Worcestershire were two brothers, the one a very honest man, and
by his honest means I and good industry, had gotten to himself a pretty house,
and crowns in his purse. But his brother being a careless unthrift, and
envying at his brothers prosperous estate, yet kept he it to himself, until
finding opportunity, one night (but they two being in the house together;)
this graceless unthrift forthwith knocked his brother on the head, which when
he had done, he cut off his legs, and buried him under the harth in the
chimney, and laid the stones again very artificially, hoping then that all the
goods were his own; and when the neighbors enquired of him for his brother,
he told them that he was gone a journey far off, to visit some of his
friends. But (a short tale to make) this murderer made a feast, and invited
his neighbors and his friends; and when they were all assembled together
within the house, as they sat by the fire side, they perceived the stones in
the chimney to rise, and the fire tumbled down out of the chimney, for the
heat of the fire made the dead carcass swell: and then search being made, the
carcass was found, and the murderer taken and executed. God I beseech him
bless every good man from murder, and from being murdered.

I have known many times, that some (through ignorance) have committed
murder, in parting of a fray, I mean such as are not experimented in the
Law, nor have no reason in such a case; for many times they which should keep
the peace, commit murder ignorantly, I mean, in coming in, either with club
or halberd, or such like weapon, and coming behind one of the two that are in
fight, strikes him on the head, when he little expects any hurt of any
other, but from him which he is now in hand withal, when indeed in such a
case, they ought to strike down the weapons of those which are fighting or
breaking them, but not strike them. Whose minds are occupied with fury one
against the other, and little expecting a mischief to come from one which they
never offended. Again some in parting of a fray will run in betwixt them, and
hold his familiar friend, and leave the other at liberty, and by this means he
which has been at liberty has killed him which is so holden, when many times
it had not so fallen out, if they had been both let alone to shift for
themselves, therefore men ought to have experience and to use discretion in the
parting of a fray, for fools do never forecast of a mischief before hand, but
wise men prevent it before it falls.

Wherefore I would wish whatsoever thou be, which read this lesson, to
remember it, and regard the life of a man, although many are at some times very
unruly, yet let no abuse cause thee to commit murder, neither in thy own
quarrel, nor in parting of any other: for I have heard and known many times
that a small stroke has been given with no intention of murder, yet it has
fallen out to the contrary, yea and contrary unto all men's expectation, which
have seen that a man with his fist or with a riding rod, or with a penny
loaf, and other things of less danger, and yet some have dyed being stricken
therewithal.

CHAP. IIII. which shows unto whom skill belongs, with the fruits of
drunkenness.
He which can govern himself is wise, but that must proceed from God.
MAny will say that skill in weapons is a good thing, and fit to be learned of
every man, yet all men will say it is pity that a man without government
should know the secret skill in weapons, for indeed skill does most chiefly of
all belong to a man that has wit and discretion to govern it, that when he
has skill knows how to use it as it ought to be used, for a good thing
learned and abused were better refused and never learned: for some when they
have a little more skill then every common man, then will they think by
brauing every man which comes in their company, by swaggering it with proud
brags and high looks, yet I have known such swaggering companions which have
had more hair then wit, meet with their match and carry away the blows with
disgrace, and yet themselves beginners of the quarrel when they might have
lived quiet if they would.

Therefore he which wears the greatest whistle is not the best Mariner, nor
he the best man that makes the greatest brags, for some will brave a better
man then themselves, and swagger it out, and yet so little in themselves that
they will scarce hold the touching when they come to the stone to be tried,
yet every subject ought if occasion serve to fight for his King and country, if
it be for the Gospells sake, and sometimes in defense of their own reputation
and credit.

Now although this art of defense is so fit and necessary a thing for all men
to be learned, yet withal I do exhort and earnestly entreat all such as have
skill to use it in that fashion as it ought to be used, for if a man had twenty
good qualities and yet if he be a drunkard, that one ill quality overthrows
all the rest, like as when a Cow gives a good soap of milk, and then
afterward strikes it down with her foot: she is as much to be blamed for
the loss, as commended for the gift, even so a man without government grows
out of favor both with God and man, for many a man without discretion and
judgment many times does fall out with his familiar friend, and so dare one
another into the field, presently upon the sudden falling out. Now if wit be
in neither of them, then a thousand to one but murder is committed, for a man
with skill may better fight with a hundred in the morning one after another,
then with three in an afternoon, upon drink or hot blood; for if you forbear
to kill thou may be killed thy self, if thou take thy opportunity thou may
easily kill a drunkard in his own coming in, for he will come in without
fear or wit: for drink makes a very coward challenge the best man living,
for in drink I have known many pass their words to meet in the field upon
small occasion, if with discretion the quartell were rightly considered upon;
but their own selves in the morning when they have their right wits about
them, then do they many times repent, and wish the match were to make, and that
their words were unspoken which they spoke the night before. Yet nevertheless
when a man has passed his word howsoever things fall out, he must and will
answer the challenge, yea though he loose his life by it. Lo these are the
fruits of drunkenness, al other vices may be left, but no bridle will rule a
drunkard, nor no counsel will make him forgo his draunken and swinish life,
drunkenness is the mother of all vices, for drunkenness does beget and breed
all manner of deadly sins, for by inordinate drinking thy soul is endangered,
thy body is infected, thy understanding banished, thy manhood distasted, thy
substance wasted, and beastlynesse resembled, and thy business neglected,
therefore leave that one vice, and all other will fly away with it: for as I
said before it is the only breeder and maintainer of quarrelling and fighting,
by fighting God is displeased, and the Kings Laws broken; again if murder be
committed, thou loosest thy goods, and endangerest thy life; if thou loose it
not, yet thou shall live despised, and hard of all honest minds that knows
thee, so that thy life will be more loathsome then death, therefore not to
fight at all is best, except thou be charged upon contrary to thy expectation,
then defend thy self, and yet fear as much to kill as to be killed.

CHAP. V. The cause of quarrels, and what preparation you ought to be prepared
with to answer a challenge.
Dissension, quarrels, and murder grows many times upon small occasions, yea
so small, that when it comes to the ears and to be disputed upon amongst
the the wise, when they have skand it over yields up their verdit, saying such
and such are fallen out for the value of a rush, and such and such have killed
one another for just nothing, is not here more madness? Be well advised before
thou do pass thy word, for a man will be as good as his word, for a man will
be as good as his word, if it do cost him his life: for it is a cowards trick
to cry peccaui, or least in sight the next morning.
yet I will not say but at one time or another a man's reputation may be so
nearly touched, that it cannot stand with his credit to pocket it up, although
it be made upon drink, for indeed the pot is the chief cause almost of all
quarrels, yet being wronged, it can not stand with a man's credit, to keep
his weapon in his sheathe; neither do I counsel all men to pocket up all
injuries which some will proffer them, but to answer a good quarrel, not only
with words but with deeds, as follows, for the further instruction. Whosoever is
honorably challenged unto single combat, the challenged may make choice of
his weapon, and likewise of the time when, and of the place where.

Likewise, the challenged may choose to fight on foot or on horse back, which
for his best advantage he shall think fittest: now also the challenged is to
consider well the quality of the Challenger, that thereby he may make the
better provision of such furniture as may serve for his own defense, and
likewise to terrify and hurt the challenger.

Now, if the challenger be chollericke and hasty, then charge thy point
directly upon him, that if he prease upon thee, he may come upon his own
death: but before thou go into the field, discharge thy duty and conscience
toward God, as well as in weapons, for thy best advantage, otherwise it can not
choose but be to thy body dangerous, and unto thy soul doubtful, and a most
principal note is this to be observed, for thou art not sure whether ever thou
shall return again or never.

Remember your skill, when you are at play, or in fight, for I have known
many, when their fight and play is ended, they do remember, that with this
trick, or with that trick they might have defended themselves, and either
hurt or disgraced their enemy, but many (through madness and fury) remember it
not till it be too late.

If you be both skillful in the false play, then I hold it good for both to
play upon the true play, for it booteth but little to use false play to one
that knows how to proffer it, and how to defend it; for it is ill halting
before a Cripple, yet I will not say but the best of all may be deceived by
false play, but especially false play may stand thee in great stead, upon those
which are not come unto the full perfection of knowledge: Again, one may have
skill in one kind of false play, but not in all.

Now whether thy enemy be skillful or not, it is a very easy matter to know so
soon as he begins to charge his weapon, if thou had no former
knowledge before hand. If two crafty knaves meet at dice, if either of them
shift in false dice, the other will perceive it presently, and so they will
know each other to be gamesters, but they will give over the sooner, with small
loss each to other, referring themselves to their better fortunes, and hoping
to meet with easier gamesters; even so I wish all men, if they perceive
themselves to be hardly matched, the wiser of them to yield upon composition,
after reasonable trial made each one of the other, before any great hurt be
done; for the best man that ever breathed, has, and may meet with his equal:
and when two good men meet, the conquest will be hardly and dangerously ended
on the one side, except Discretion be a mediator to take up the matter, before
it come to the worst, if by friends it be not ended before hand; but if thou
can hurt thy enemy, yes, although it be but a little, or unarm him of his
weapon, which thou may very easily do, if thou do fight with good
discretion. And either of these are accounted for a victory; also, take this
for a general rule always, keep thy body within compass of true Defense,
considering otherwise, that the danger is great in that part of the body which
lies most discovered, and is nearest unto thine enemy.

Now when thy enemy does assault thee, and is lifting up his weapon to
discharge at thee, be not then to prepare thy Defense, but be ready before hand
to defend every part of thy body, according to my directions, as when you come
to it you shall see more plainly. For thou do not know before hand where the
blow will light: As shrinking up of shoulders is no payment of debts, no more
will winking or blinking defend thy carcass, as those which have no skill will
wink: therefore, again, and again, I say, be prepared with skill before
hand. Most sure it is the blow must have his fall: but at every weapon I have
showed how to defend it, therefore the Defender must be well experienced
before hand with his defense, at such a weapon as he means usually to carry,
that when the blow does light, thou may be in thy defense, not to defend
thine enemies blow only, but also to answer him again in the time of
advantage, for a quick answer shows good cunning. Nor to know the true place
for the holding of of thy weapon, that is not all, but always so long as thou
art within thy enemies danger continue them in their place, except it be at the
very instant time when thou go about to offend thine enemy, and that must be
done with a very good discretion, and thy weapon must be recovered up again
into his place nimbly. Now if thy enemy do discover some part of his body,
that, to thy seeming, lies very open, yet be not too hasty in offering play,
though the bait be never so fair, bite not at it too rashly or unadvisedly,
lest like the foolish Fish you be taken with the hook which lies covered with
the bait; for if your enemy find your weapon or weapons out of the place of
true defense, yea if it be but an inch too high, or too low, too wide, or too
narrow, it is as much as concerns thy life: if thou be matched with one that
is skillful, never ouerlay thy self with a heavy weapon, for nimblenesse of
body, and nimblenesse of weapon are two chief helps for thy advantage in
play. Again, and again I say, strike not one blow in fight, at what weapon
soever thou fightest withal, except it be a wrist blow, and that you may
as well do with a rapier, as with a sword, for a wrist blow consumes but a
little time, yet better use no blow at all, but continually, thrust after
thrust: for (in my mind) he is a man ignorant and very vnvnskilfull that will
be hurt with a blow, and if thou make an assault upon thy enemy do not tarry
by it, to maintain it, for in making the assault distance is broken, wherefore
recover back into your guard and distance again so soon as you can, and
always let your ees be on your enemies face, and not altogether on the point,
then you may be deceived, by the swift motion of the hand, for the motion of
the hand is swifter then the eye or foot, many will set their eyes upon their
enemies point, or upon his hand for the avoiding of this error, the best remedy
is daily exercise and practice one with another, and to play with more then
one, otherwise thou will never come unto true defense for it is good to be
acquainted with every man's fashion, for that trick which will hit one will not
hit another, and therefore be well experienced not only in the true play but
in the false; I mean for the defense and offense of both, that if thou can
not prevail with the one then use the other: yet take heed of hasty
aduenturing in, least thou with the foolish bird which flies into the lime
bush, and being in, the more she strives, the faster she is; then make no more
have then good speed, least thou be taken in thy own folly, for many times
haste makes waste: if thou shootest at a mark if the mark be never so fair,
yet if thou shoot hastily without discretion, thou may oftener miss then hit;
also I do advise thee not to determine to answer every thrust or blow home
which thy enemy does assault thee with; but to answer it something short until
thou perceive whether he have any false play or not, otherwise if thou make thy
answer home, he may deceive thee by false play: now if both be experienced in
the true play and false then you might continue in fight a whole day, if it
were possible to endure so long and have no hurt: if thou have a close hilted
dagger and a rapier, I hold them more surer then a sword and dagger, but with
the skillful there is no danger in either of them; again in fight a man need
not use half the skill which he may learn, the second point of hawking is to
hold fast, and the second and chiefest point in this exercise is to learn to
defend thy self, and to use it when thou have occasion, then remember where
about thou art.

And let no illusions cause thee to look about thee when thou art within thy
enemies distance, least he take the advantage when thou do not see him, or
before thou be aware, as many do: for after when thou have the wound, it is
but a folly for thee to say, I had thought he would not have stricken me so
cowardly: I remember a tale as I heard out of Germany, thus it was, the Master
and usher of a school had upon occasion appointed the field, and their weapon
was each of them a two handed sword, and meeting at the place appointed, said
the Master thou art not so good as thy word, the Usher asked him why; marry
said he thou promisest to bring no body with thee, and yet look yonder what a
number of people are coming toward thee, the usher no sooner looked about,
but the Master smote off his head, and afterward meeting with some of his
friends said, I have taught my man a new trick this morning said he, which he
never learned before. Lo thus he killed him by policy, but it it was no manly
trick, neither do I commend this manner of murder: in my mind the Master had
been better that he had denied to go into the field with his man, then to have
such a clog of murder upon his conscience by killing of him, by what means or
policy soever; for every one ought to remember that he must not take vengeance,
when and where he may, so often as an inury is proffered him, concerning this
there is a good example to be imitated by strong beasts which never turn
again when little curs run barking after them, for the mighty or skillful
ought to use their power moderately, for so they may the better use
continually, for although fighting be the trial of cunning and skill in
weapons, and many men thereby prove their force, and yet afterward become
great frinds, for fighting is nothing dangerous being both wary and skillful:
but now in my mind much deceived are those which think that a quarrel begun
with words cannot he ended but with weapons, but my opinion is that so long as
no blows pass but only words, yet words are the cause of many quarrels, for
words will sting worse then a nettle, and prick deeper then a thorn, and cut
more keener then a sword, yet for all that let wisdom and reason guide thy
hand and after you have cross one another with two or three cross words, then
fall into a civil kind of reasoning the matter, and not in fury suffering it
to grow into any further quarrel, for a little spark at the first is easily
quenched, even so upon the drinking of a cup of wine or a pipe of Tobacco, or
upon such a light matter of no importance many a quarrel is begun; now in such
a case I would wish the wiser of the two in his good discretion, to yield
first, and so to end it without further grudging, for reasonable speeches may
be a full satisfaction where a small offense is committed.

But now if one of the parties in a stubborn frowardness will not yield but
rather go into the field with a desire to kill the other, now if there be
never a one of them wise, murder is committed and at leisure repented: but he
which first begins the quarrel, or gives the first box on the ear, rashly
or unadvisedly, upon a small matter as aforesaid, is worthy and well deserves
to be answered again with three, or else with the bastinado. And to match with
this I will tell you a tale of a Friar, who in his sermon said if one give thee
a blow on the one ear, turn the other and take another, and a lusty
seruingman hearing him, after the sermon was ended, he came unto the Friar and
said, sir you made a good Sermon, but yet in my mind there was small reason in
one lesson that you gave us, what was that said the Friar, marry quoth the
seruing-man that if one give me a blow on the ear, I should turn the other,
and take another: why says the friar the Scripture commands us so to do,
but quoth the serving man will you follow the scripture herein, yes marry that
I will said the Friar, with that the seruing-man up with his fist and gave him
a good box on the ear; the friar turned the other, and took another, but now
says the Scripture (quoth the Friar) look what you would have others do to
you, do the like to them; look what measure you meat, the like measure shall
be measured to you again, with heap and thrust, and running over, and with
that the Friar took a good crab-tree cudgel and beat the seruing-man well
fauouredly, and so to our former matter again. Does every blow that is given
deserve the answering in the field, I say not but first requite the blow
again, as before said, for I have valued the rate of the first beginner so low
as may be, for he is worthy to be requited, not in the same manner, but in a
more open fashion, requite the box again, and then being equalled of the
first wrong; let him which began the game reckon of his penny-worths, and if
in casting up his reckoning he find himself a looser, let him sit down by
his loss, and learn to make a wiser bargain an other time; but if it cannot
be so ended, then it must be answered otherwise as occasion shall serve.

Now if the lie be given before you grow into choler with a rash foolish
fellow; first, consider in what case the party is, which gives the lie, before
thou strike; for in drink or in fury I have seen one give the lie, which
would not have done it at an other time, I mean when he had his right wits
about him. Well, but say a man, at such time, and in such a case, do give the
lie, some mad heads will say, that it deserves the stabbe presently; Therefore
do not that to day which may be repented of to morrow.
but I never knew any man stabbe or kill another, upon what occasion soever,
but he was sorry for it afterward:That mariner is not to be commended which
gets his cunning by many ship-wreckes; nor that man is not to be praised for
his government which gets it by his punishment, which he has for the
killing of two or three men.

Now, upon the receiving the lie, if the stabbe be not given, some giddie
headed kill-calues will say, that such a man took the lie, and did not answer
it with a stabbe, wherefore he is a coward; but now I say, and this is my
opinion, he shows the best wit, and most valor, which seeing a man out of
the way, (as we term it) will give a mild and a quiet answer unto a froward
question: also the wiser sort will commend the patience of him that can bear
with one that is past reason; for all men know, that he which commits
murder, will afterward wish with bitter reares, that he had conquered his
affections, and stayed his hands, I mean, if there be any spark of grace at
all in him; and the first which strikes, many times loses his life,
therefore though thou cannot rule thy tongue, yet have a care to rule thy hands
before a mischief be done, for he which commits murder, when he comes
to examination, it is but a simple excuse to say, The other gave me the lie,
and called me knave, and I could not brook it. There is a pretty example, and
worth the noting concerning such a matter (as I have heard it) and thus it was.
A Judge sitting in judgment against a murderer, who answered for himself
saying, and it please you my Lord, he gave me the lie, and called me knave.
Why said the Judge, will thou kill a man for that? call me knave, and give me
the lie: the Judge being importunate, in the end, the murderer said, You are a
knave, and you do lie; then the Judge took the skirt of his coat and shook
it, and said, Lord, now what am I the worse? but every man can not be so
patient: although some will keep company seven years, and yet never give any
cause of quarrel: yet some again will upon a little drink, or upon a small
occasion quarrel, swagger and fight almost in every company they come into;
there is a Proverb goes, He which has an ill name, is half hanged: Before
he comes to the Barie, another Proverb touching our former matter says, He
which is accounted for an early riser, may lie a bed till eleauen of the
clock: even so he which has tried his manhood, afterward the world will
judge and say, that he is a man of his hands, and that he dare fight upon a
good occasion; but if he make a common occupation of fighting, he will then
be accounted for a common quarreller, and his friends will refuse his company
many times for doubt of his quarrelling, and yet he shall never be accounted,
more then a man again. He which is quarrelsome shall oftentimes meet with
his match; but if a tried fellow do at sometimes forbear when he is wronged
or challenged, the wiser sort will never account the worse manhood in him;
therefore except it be upon a most open and great abuse, let Patience be thy
buckler, and a fair tongue thy sword, and always have a care in the beginning
what will be the end; for a mischief sometimes happens in an hour which
happens not in seven years again, but Oh thrice happy were that man,
which toward the latter end of his days, can without a pair of lying lips
say, I thank my God, I never bare malice, nor I never injuriously wronged any
man, in thought, word, or deed in all my life.

CHAP. VI. Diverse reasons or introductions to bring thee the better unto the
knowledge of thy weapon.
IF thou do mean to practice after my direction, then put thy weapons in
their right place, looking not only to the picture, but to the words going
before and after, likewise, frame your head, body, foot, and hand, according
to my direction (as it follows) after the first picture; for if either your
weapons, or any part of your body be out of their place: yea, though it be but
an inch too high, an inch too low, too wide, or too narrow, it is as much as
your life is worth; If your enemy be very skillful and willing withal:
therefore, when thou go to practice, read it advisedly, with understanding,
for I could have made a great Volume, in describing many sorts of guards at
every weapon, but it would have been an intricate piece of work, and
needelesse for every common man to know.

For as some Scriueners can write twenty kinds of hands, yet one or two will
serve the turn; but the more sorts being well written, are the more to be
commended, but to have an entrance into many, and not to do one well, is not
worth commendations: even so one guard perfectly learned at every weapon, may
serve thee for thy true defense whilst thou live, against all other guards.

It is but little available to thee, if thou see a good Scriuener write,
except thou take the pen and practice to write, as he does; even so, it
booteth thee but little, that would be skillful of thy weapon, if thou do
see two skillful men play except thou take weapons and practice to do as they
have done before thee.

Again, it is not enough for him that would write well, to write his copy but
once over, and so leave, no more must thou, if thou will have skill in thy
weapons, thou must not give over with playing of one bowt, but thou must
exercise it many times, and practice it often.

And if a man write well, and exercise it never so much, yet he can never
exceed, well written; even so in skill of weapons a man may be perfect, and
play well; but when thou have learned the true and perfect skill with thy
weapons, thou may exercise for thine health and recreation, but thou shall
never pass that word, well played.

Also, he which writes much, and does not regard his coppie, but writes after
his own will, I think it were strange for such a Scholar to write well, but
he will always write a ragged hand: even so he that gets him hilts and
cudgells, and goes about to learn of his own head without direction of one
that is skillful, it were better that he had never played, if afterward he go
to learn; for he must first unlearn that which he has learned, which will
be very hard to be done without great pains taking.

Now he which writes a good Secretary hand, and then afterward he goes to
learn Roman hand, or Court hand, or any other the like, he does not thereby
loose his Secretary; but if he can write all kind of hands, then may he use
most, that which he likes best, or thinks fittest: even so, he which has
(by his practice) gotten good skill, and yet being of an other man's teaching,
it is of an other manner of teaching, and I will not say but that it may be so
good or better then mine: yet he which learneth my rules or follows my
directions, it can not hinder him any whit at all, but if he have once gotten
them by good and perfect practice, if he like them not, may go to his old
fashion again, or learn of any other afterward.

Yet again, as the observing of a true distance in a Scriuener between every
line, is commendable in his writing, so it be done without ruling of it, which
comes by much practice; even so in true skill in sight, distance is a most
excellent thing, and the principallest thing of all, next unto the guard to be
observed and kept, and it must be gotten by great practice.

Again, when you learn to write at the first, you write leasurely, but with
much practice your hand comes to be swifter; even so, with often use of thy
weapon, thy hand will come to defend either blow, or thrust more readily or
more speedily then at the first beginning of thy practice, albeit thou be
shown how to defend; and though thou have the reason perfectly in thy head,
and know when an other does it well, yet without practice thou can never
be skillful in defense of thy self.

Also, he which writes, and with his pen does sputter his paper with incke,
a Scholar will think, if it be not a great blot, it is a small matter, but a
Scriuener will say, it is a great fault; even so, if thy weapon or any part of
thy body be out of the right place, yea, though it be but a little, yet it will
seem to him that has skill, as much as a great blotte does to a Scriuener in
a coppie Book.

Moreover, he which learneth to write, must continually look to his coppie,
and must write according to it; for one letter, or one line well written, is
better then a great deal of incke and paper spoiled, and not one letter well
made: even so, one blow, or one thrust performed orderly, I mean, in his due
time, and likewise to the right place, is better then an hundred unorderly done.

Furthermore, if in writing an Obligation, a Scriuener do write one letter of
Roman hand, and another of Secretary, another of Court hand, it will not be
seemly, nor commendable, but with what hand you begin with, to end with the
same; even so you may frame your self, sometimes into one guard, and sometimes
into an other, taking heed always, that you observe the same defense which
belongs to the guard; for if you are in one guard, and you use the defense of
another, so you may deceive your self (for every guard differs in defense
and offense) and betwixt every blow, and every thrust, and every guard which
I have here described in this Book: there is as great odds as is betwixt
Secretary hand, Court hand, and Roman hand: nay the several difference of
guards are more in number then there are several kinds of hands in writing,
yea many more then any Fiddler can play lessons upon his instrument, and the
nature of the guards do differ as much as one lesson from another; wherefore
those that think one defense serves for defense of all guards, are as much
deceived, as they that think there is but one kind of lesson to be played
upon all instruments: for that several kinds of lessons are to be played upon
all instruments are infinite; even so, the several guards for defense and
offense are not to be numbered; for, between the true skill in weapons, and the
false, are an hundred of each at the least, and the contrariest and the most
unseemly, every man has by nature, but the best and surest way is to be
learned by Art of them that are skillful; wherefore see every man's judgment.
For as thou may hear at one Sermon that which thou shall never hear
again, even so thou may learn of one teacher, that thou can not learn
of another: for every one that practices natural play without direction of
one that is skillful, such a one in his practice, will have one foolish trick
or other: which when they have by common practice long used, will hardly be
withdrawn from it: as for example, some will be setting their foot upon their
weapons, as if it were to stretch him when he was right before, but they do it
of a foolish custom that they learn of themselves: likewise, some will puff
and blow like a broken winded horse when they are at play, and some will dance
and keep a trampling with their feet, and some will flourish and waver with
their weapons, some will whistle, and some will be blabbring of spittle in
their mouths, and putting out their tongues, and some again will run about
as though they could stand on no ground, and it is as hard to wrest or drive
them from such unseemly customs, as it is to drive a dog from a piece of
bread.

Yet many do not see it in themselves, but unto the skillful, which behold
them, it will seem very unseemly, and by nature, every one has the woorst
way; as for example, there are but two ways for the bowing of the head, either
to the right hand, or to the left, and by nature, every one does bow him
toward the left side, rather ten to the right side; and there is very great
odds betwixt the right and the wrong in true defense, as I have described in
my reasons more at large, both in the place of Sword and Dagger, and Rapier and
Dagger, for it is great advantage to lean thy head toward the right shoulder
a little; and at the beginning of your practice it is very easy to frame your
self to my fashion, with standing both with feet and body, for the use of
the foot comes not by nature, but by practice. Again, many young men will
be grown with slothfulness, and be so lazy, that they must be haled (as it
were) with cartropes to any good exercise, accounting him their greatest enemy
which gives them the best counsel, but to all folly they are prone and apt of
themselves, but persuade them to any goodness, and you shall see them hang
arse-ward like a dog in a string.

Most youth, for example, are willing to go to School at the first, but
within a week or less, away must the book be laid, for fear lest much
learning make them mad, as Festus said to Paul, for they will wax dull and
weary with a little pains taking.

And next, they must to the Fence School, but there I am persuaded they need
not learn offense, and I think a little defense is enough for them; for many
will be weary of well doing quickly, saying as the Porters of Bristow, a new
Master, a new, and hang up the old; even so, from the Fence school they must
go to the Dancing school, thinking that to be the only exercise in the
world, but with a little practice they wax weary of dancing likewise: then
they say, Oh that here were one to teach Music! that exercise they should
never be weary of, but within a little while that will be too tedious a matter
to comprehend: so you may perceive young men (by their wills) will take pains
at nothing, I mean, not one in twenty, but what they are forced unto.

Now I do not put down those vanities, here before in this Chapter
expressed, thereby that thou should wax the worse, by the reading of it,
but I do wish thee to mark others, and likewise examine thy self, that if
thou see in others, or find in thy self such foolishness, refrain while thou
art young.

Although many there be that do use foolish tricks, and perceive them not in
themselves to be unseemly, but suppose they become them well, as he that
wauereth his weapon, or runs about, wearieth him self: besides, he that so
runs is in danger of falling, for a little shrub, bush, briar, stone, or
moule-hill, may soon overthrow him which does not trauerse his ground
leasurely and orderly; for he which has true defense must be steadie in his
guard with his foot and hand in their right place, whereas he which wauereth
his weapon is at no certain guard for his defense; therefore, to keep steadie
your weapons in their right place, is the best way: for, one blow, or one
thrust, orderly done, is better then an hundred without skill or out of order;
for cunning in weapons may be compared to tricks at Cards, for if one show a
trick at Cards, it will seem strange to him that never saw it before; but to
him that can do it, it is nothing troublesome: even so, as that trick at
Cards is nothing when the secret is known, but very easy to be done: even
so, the best way at weapons, is as easy to be followed (being known) as the
worst.

Far deceived are those which imagine they cannot attain unto the perfect
skill of Defense with Rapier and Dagger, without such antique fashions of
learning, which many of late years have devised, some wreathing their bodies
like unto a coakes, and some, as though they were going to dance the Antique,
which makes many that have no experience at this weapon think it impossible
ever to frame their bodies, as they see these do, which I speak of: but now
these fantastical fellows will persuade a man, that it is not possible to
play well at Rapier and Dagger, except a man can frame his body as they do; but
I say, the best and surest way is the easiest to be attained unto; for a boy of
fifteen years of age, may (by small practice) defend himself against any
man, with his rapier and dagger; for a thrust with a rapier is more fearful
then with a sword, and a man may see the thrust better of a sword then with a
rapier, because there is odds in the breadth and bigness each of the other.
Again, a man shall thrust further with a rapier then with a sword, for the
hilt of a sword will shorten your reach, by reason of the closeness of the
hilt, though they be both of one length.

Yet many are of this opinion, and will say, it is better to fight with a Sword
and Dagger, then with Rapier and Dagger, the reason is (say they) with my Sword
I may both strike and thrust.

But I say, and by good experience I speak if, that he which strikes in
fight, gives his enemy a great advantage; besides, a Sword may either bow or
break, and so by that means he that strikes may fall into his enemies
mercy. Besides that, a boy of fifteen years of age may safely defend the
strongest man's blow that is, according to my direction following in the first
Picture; for a weak man, or a boy, may defend more with both his hands, then a
strong man can charge him with one; for many can not forbear striking, being
moved thereunto by anger, except they have been grounded in the disadvantage
of it by much practice; he that does defend a blow double, and make a quick
answer with a thrust, by turning of his knockes inward, may hit any man that
strikes, and yet defend himself without loss of time.

For the defense of a blow double, is sure, and yet you may answer your enemy
so soon, and with as much danger to him as if you did defend it single, for it
may be all done with one motion, both the defense and offense.

Furthermore, I would counsel all Clothiers or Chapmen, which carry many
times more money then they are worth, for their defense against false knaves,
to carry a Staff in their iournies, whether it be on horse back or on foot;
for a good weapon does not only serve to keep the peace, but also a man's
purse from a thief, and likewise to be experienced in the skill thereof, if
they should be driven to encounter upon a sudden at the like weapon. But a
staff may easily encounter against a Sword and dagger, although but small
experience be in the Staffeman; but a little skill is a great help at a time of
need, which if thou have not obtained in thy youth, then be not ashamed to
learn when thou art old; for as in a school of learning, there are some in
Grammar, and some in the Crosse-row; so the greatest Judge in the land was in
the Crosse-row first: even so into a schole of Defense there comes, as well
badde players, as good, and he which is the good player ought not, nor it is
not a thing usual to mock or skoffe at him which is the badde player: and
what of all this? Nothing, but to show, that it is better to learn late then
never, I mean especially any good exercise or quality, which is, or may be
profitable for a Commonwealth, healthy to the body, and commendable to to the
world, for we are not borne altogether for our selves, but our Parents,
Friends, and Country have interest in our birth.

Now although some will talk of this and that, and say, that they have fought
with four or six men at once, yet I can conceive no reason, how any man
should defend two men, especially if they be both willing to spoil, or kill;
for when thine eye is directly upon one of them; the other, in the mean while,
may kill thee, if he be disposed; for the motion of the eye is flower then the
motion of the hand; for a man cannot cast his eye about so quick, but that he
which is behind thee, or on the one side of thee, may kill thee, if they be
both willing (as I have said before:) But indeed if one skillful man have two
or three upon him, and be in a narrow place, that they can not get about him,
then may he defend himself a long time without hurt.

A left hand skillful has odds against a right handed man, one reason is,
that a left handed man is continually used to a right hand, but a right hand
does seldom meet with a left handed man; another reason is, a right handed
man, when he does open his right side of his head, by offering play, although
he bear his Dagger to the right ear, yet it does not defend that side, so
sure, nor so strong as it does the left side. But indeed, so long as the right
handed man lies in his guard of defense upon his Backe-sword, for the
Backe-sword is the chiefest point of defense against a left handed man;
therefore when you encounter against a left handed man, you must be careful
and heedie, if you do offer play, to recover your guard again presently, and
be in the defense of your Backe-sword guard: But of this I will speak more at
large hereafter.

CHAP. VII. That Fear and Fury are both enemies to true valor.
I Have taken upon me a very hard question to decide: for I can not well set
out the office of the one, but with disgrace of the other; the one is so clean
contrary to the other: First, that Fear is an enemy unto valor, I need not
to make any long discourse, for every one will say, that the fearful man will
never attempt any thing worthy the name of Valor, but always bear a load of
injuries upon his broad shoulders, excusing all the wrongs which are done him,
saying, that they were done with no intent of wrong, and so himself first
craving pardon of those which offend him, but yet bearing an injury in his
mind, until he can revenge it, by virtue of an office, or one way or another;
also, he is a raiser of mutinies, and loves to see other together by the
ears, and yet keep himself out of danger, but some I have known, which have
bin timersome and cowardly, show great valor, but indeed it was when there
was no remedy but that they must needs fight. Again, I have known many
simple cowardly men, who being well experienced with skill, and being practiced
therein, do wax bold and valorous; for when (by often trial) they see that
they can save and defend themselves, what need have they to fear, for there
is a certainty of defense, and he which has it, may be as sure without
making any doubt or question, as it is for Arithmetitian to cast up several
sums just to a penny: even so certain may a skillful man be in his defense:
and it is as easy to make a fearful or cowardly man, perfect in knowledge,
and so by knowledge to bring him to be valorous; yea more easy it is then to
make a hasty man, of valor and stomach, to forbear his former resolution;
for as no persuasions will make a drunkard forsake his drunkenness, but only
poverty or death: even so there is almost no means to persuade the furious
and hasty man from this sudden quarrelling and stabbing, but only many
dangerous wounds, imprisonment, or death: Yet if such a one do run through
many brawles, and so continue, until his own rod has beaten him, by crosses
and troubles: if all these can not make him live civil, and in sober fashion,
as he ought to do, yet old age will bring experience, and will make him as
tame as a sheep; for when he is old, then he will say, that a man should
not adventure further then skill being tempered with discretion, does allow:
for observe I pray you, if you chance to see two skillful men play or fight;
and if these two fall into choler and fury, so that like two wild Bulls
they go to it pell mell, then it is chance noddy to hitte or miss; for where
fury has the upper hand it is not worth the sight to the beholders, for they
can show no true Art, except they observe distance, for distance being broken,
they cut or hurt one another which is a great disgrace unto true Art, and a
discouragement to many which would learn skill, but that they see by such
hasty fools, that skill avails not, and indeed it does little avail such
as cannot bridle their hasty affections; but yet many will say it is true, yet
they cannot beware of the devil, until they are plagued with his damme. For
after a skilfuil man has received hurt he presently condemns his own folly,
for receiving that which he might have avoided if his mind had been on his
business; now as I would have no man turn coward but to answer a good
quarrel, so likewise I would most earnestly wish all men to forbear and not
maintain such light and idle braules which either spring from lewd women, as
that are pot frayes, for drunkenness is the cause of the most quarrels that
be, yet still I do allow and commend any man to answer his enemy upon a good
quarrel, and to stand against him, if he do assault thee: for that will make
others to fear to do thee wrong or thy friend wrong, thinking that thou will
rite it. Now he which is valorous by nature, and has no skill, and yet has a
good strength, courage, and stomach, many times does adventure rashly without
fear or wit, not much unlike a foolish gamester which urges and never
counts upon his fellows game, but many times it were better hold then vie,
for as some loose their money by their rash vying at the one, so many loose their
lives by a foolish bold hardiness at the other: for many in their very first
attempt, or as it were their entering into hope to get the praise of the world
to be accounted valorous loose their lives, which is for want of mixing
discretion with stomach.

Many examples to this effect might be shown which happened in the wars of
France, Flanders and Ireland, for in all these places as good men for valor as
ever the Sun did shine upon, lost their lives upon the very first attempt,
only by rashness, and so their honor is written in a Chronicle of dust, for
it even dyed with them.

I hold it a greater credit to retreat for thine own safety being in danger,
rather then still to charge one and so be slain or sore wounded, yet mistake
me not, for I do not here commend running away neither, but use a mean and
policy in retreating, for running away is a cowards defense. A good man may
give back for his advantage, and no disgrace at all, if men of judgment do
see it, and do judge with discretion. For the valiantest Captain that ever
did breath, for his advantage would retreat without any dishonor at all,
therefore he which will be accounted valorous, and run through many dangers
and bry ats of mischief, quarrels and troubles of this world, he must many
times be patient upon a great wrong proffered him, but afterward with
discretion examine thy force and thy skill together, how thou may without
hazard of thy life revenge the wrong offered, and that thou may so fight as
thou may fight again, without loosing thy life upon the first assault as
many do. but he is a fool which will adventure all his goods in one ship,
especially if it be in a dangerous voyage, or all his money at one throw at dice
although he know the run of the dice never so well, for he that does so may
hap to loose all. For there are many dangers at sea and many chances at dice,
but a good quarrel does half defend himself, and also a good quarrel many
times makes a coward fight: again, it is a great discredit to be counted a
run away, the unskillful must do for his own defense at sometimes and yet
stomach enough.

Therefore whether it be in single combat or other wise, use thy weapon with
discretion, without choler or hastiness, looking unto thy business which
thou have in hand, soberly and mildly, and let wisdom guide the bridle, for so
may thou go through many a quarrel and run through many skirmishes often
without hurt, although not without danger.

There is no exercise learned but by often practice, for so it is made perfect:
valor, and stomach comes by nature, but skill never comes by nature, and
he which is grounded in skill by art and practice will not fear the proud
brags of any man. But now if such a one fight he uses his skill and depends
chiefly upon it, but the hasty and furious man thinks tstat he is never near
enough, and so many of them never fight but once, for they are slain in their
own hastiness, the very first time of aduenturing; for haste oftentimes
makes wast.

I do remember a pretty jest of King Henry the eight as I have heard it, that
when he went to Bulloigne he sent out his Presse-masters, commanding them to
bring all the lustiest hackers in the country, and they brought and presented
him with many that in fight had received many wounds, the skarres whereof
remained, and the King beholding them saw that some of them had been cut in
the face in one place, and some in another, and some on the head, and some had
lost some of their singers; then said the King unto the Presse-masters, I like
these men well; but yet go fetch me them which did cut those fellows, whereby
he meant that those which had the most hurts were not the best men.

CHAP. VIII. How the use of weapons came, also the number of weapons used from
time to time, with other good instructions.
MAN was first created naked, without any weapons naturally, saving only hands
and feet, which are able to make but a weak resistance against any great
violence, only this the hands to thrust away that which may annoy us, and the
feet to run from that which may hurt us. Now al other creatures except man are
naturally armed with such weapons as does oftentimes kill and destroy any other
beast which does offend them.

As for example, God in his creation furnished the Lion, the Bear, the Dog,
and the Wolf, and other such like beasts, whith long and sharp teeth and
claws, and they are with them able to tear in pieces and devour any man or
beast, which they oppose themselves against, now other beasts there are whose
strength consists in other parts, and they do avenge themselves in other
manner; as the Unicorn and the Bull, with their horns, and the force of their
heads, so that there is no other beast or creature is able to abide the
violence and force thereof.

Also note the force of fowls of the air as the fawcon, and the Eagle, what a
dangerous weapon is the beak of them unto such fowls or beasts as they oppose
themselves against.

Likewise for venomous beasts, as the Serpent, the Viper, the Scorpion, and
such like, are so armed with poisoned and venomous stings, which not only
terrifieth but hurts and destroieth those men or beasts comes near them.

Likewise God in his creation made all creatures to several purposes, but most
of all for the use of man, for some he made to feed us, some to cloth us, some
to sport us, and some to carry us, and some to destroy us.

Lo thus much by the way of argument, as a preamble to that which I intend to
speak of concerning weapons as follows.

In old time amongst men the strongest carry away the victory, I mean at that
time when there was little or no other weapon used, but only tooth and nail,
hands and feet: now in those days many men did think that they made a good
hand when they saved themselves by flight, or any other means, from those
which were to strong for them, and so the world continued a long time, the
strongest still carrying away the victory.

For what weapons had they I pray you in the time of Sampson, did not he for
want of other weapons with a law bone kill and destroy a thousand Philistims in
a small time without any hurt to himself?

Now at this time if there had been any weapons of more danger put the case
this. Although Sampson was charged upon such a sudden whereby he had no
leisure to arm himself, yet you must understand and know, that his enemies
came purposely to be revenged upon him, because he had burned up their corn:
wherefore if there had been weapons they would have been so armed without all
doubt or question, and so provided for him, that either they would have wounded
or killed him, before he should have made such havoc or slaughter amongst
them.

Again, what weapons had they when Saingar slew six hundred Philistimes with
an ox goade, as in the third of Judges there you may read it in the last verse.

But after this as the number of people begun to multiply, and the malice,
rage, and fury of man began to increase, first they began to revenge themselves
with clubs, staves, slings, and darts. And afterward they studied and invented
other weapons and armor for wars, as at the first beginning of wars they made
Iron chariots, and then they armed Elephants, and horses, afterward they found
out the forging of swords, spears, Bills, Halberts, Iauelins and Partisans,
Crosse-bowes and long bows, and such like; and every kind of weapon for more
advantage and danger one then another, still changing only to make trial of
the best, for their advantage, and such they keep in use that were of greater
force not only to terrify, but to hurt and destroy their enemies. But of late
years they have changed all weapons for muskets, Harquebush, and Crosse-bowes,
Calieuers, Pikes, Swords, and Rapiers, and such like manly weapons of great
danger, especially unto the ignorant and unskillful.

Now therefore as we are provided of sundry kind of dangerous weapons, I could
wish every man to spend a little time in practicing to learn skill and cunning
at such weapons, as with skill are most safe to defend, and yet most dangerous,
and hurtful to thy enemy, considering this that the skillful and cunning man
fights without fear; for not only those which use the making of arms and
weapons are well accepted of, wherein many are accounted famous, and thereby
making a good living for their continual maintenance, but yet more accepted
are they which can use weapons well both for defense and offense: for many
thereby have gotten such credit through out all the world, insomuch that Kings
and Princes do a dorne them which are excellent therein with the names of
Knights, and some with greater titles of honor: wherefore it is a great shame
for any carrying the shape or personage of a man, but that he should be so
cunning and so furnished with skill and with continual practice, so to use it,
as not only to defend thy self, but also to speak and to discourse of weapons
and arms in what company soever thou come into fitting such a matter.

The Romans soon after the invention of swords generally they grew so expert
and cunning, that they were able and did set forth whole armies of
sword-players, such as are now called Fencers.

It is a woeful sight unto the skillful to see so many young gentlemen, which
being once blind folded with ignorance and for want of skill many times lose
their lives in fight, without reason or judgment, and yet some such there are
which will adventure; only they do it upon an aspiring mind, thinking thereby
to get the praise of the world, which is to be accounted valorous, and tall men
at arms, for to be accounted wise and valiant is every man's desire.

Wherefore as amongst the wise and ancient writers that ever wrote, we find
the wise to provide in summer for winter, in time of peace for wars; for there
is nothing so sure but as that after peace there will come wars, there is no
man living that although he carry himself never so uprightly yet at one time
or other he may be so wronged that he must needs fight: therefore he that is
wise will be armed before hand, not only with weapons, but skill; thereby to
prevent a mischief if occasion serve, as you shall hear more at large in the
next Chapter.

CHAP. IX. Shows what an excellent thing skill is, with persuasion to all men
to forbear the maintaining of idle quarrels.
TO show you what skill is it will be a hard question to decide, and a matter
too deep for me to handle, for we see daily many principal and cunning men
even at their wits end in studying and devising skill and cunning in all arts
and science, and yet to the end of their lives they find themselves ignorant in
many things, and are still to learn, yea even in that which they have always
bin trained up unto.

Wherefore I think the ground of art and cunning is not to be found out, no
although a man do travel more larger ground then the whole earth, or if he
should fly above the clouds, or diue deeper then the sea, all which is
impossible: wherefore seeing it is so large that I cannot compass it, so high I
cannot reach it, and so deep a hidden secret, that I cannot sound the bottom
of it; for I cannot travail so far, climb so high, nor wade so deep, yet so
far have I traveled and so high have I climbed, and so deep have I waded,
that I see art and skill so prevail with those which bends their minds
thereunto, they become more famous the^ any other ordinary men are, for skill
is such an excellent thing, that it abateth the choler and courage of the
hasty and furious man, so that he be tempered with discretion; even as iron
being tempered with steel, makes a blade; whereas if it be all steel, it
will be too brittle and soon broken; or all iron, then it will be too blunt:
even so, he which is furious and hasty will be soon killed. Again, skill, use
and exercise therein does overcome many ill humors, which without it, are
never to be left, as you shall hear.

For, skill makes those hardy at their weapons, which are so timersome, as
they will wincke at every blow; yea, and if he were as fearful and as
cowardly as a Hare by nature, yet such a one (by skill) becomes, bold, hardy,
and valorous; also (by use and practice) it makes a man to use both his hands
alike: wherefore I would have no man that carries the personage or shape of a
man, but he should learn as much skill in his weapons as possible he can;
and likewise learn as many gards at each weapon as thou may, that thereby
thou may be the better able to answer any man upon a good quarrel, if his
skill and cunning were never so good, but he which has skill but at one
weapon, and is acquainted but with one guard, and has but one kind of blow,
or but one kind of thrust; I do not see how such a man should be able to
defend himself from one that is skillful and cunning in many other guards, and
many blows and thrusts; for one guard, one blow, or one thrust will quickly
be worn threed-bare; it is supposed, that if a horse did know his own
strength, a man could not rule him; even so, for want of such manly knowledge,
as every one ought to be experienced in, do never come to the knowledge of
their strength, nor dare not attempt any thing worth the commendations of
manhood, only for want of experience and practice; for little does any man
know what good fortune is allotted out for him, and sure the greatest credit
and honor that ever came to any man, was through skill in weapons: such an
excellent armor is Skill, that it makes a man fight without fear: and he
which has it, will fight with such wariness, that he will hurt, and not be
hurt himself, except it be by great odds of weapons, or more then one weapon
at once.

He which is a man of his hands will have many tales brought him, but before
thou give any credit unto a Talebearer, consider well the condition of the
messenger, before thou put any confidence in his speeches, whether he be a
drunkard, a coward, or a fool; for any of these three sorts of men, there is
no credit nor trust to be given unto their speech. Again, a Gentleman, or a
man of any good fashion, ought not to carry tales: but if such a one do hear
his friend wronged behind his back, he ought with discretion to answer him,
in his friends behalf, with reasonable words, and not to report unto his
friend, the worst that he hears an idle fellow speak, except it be a matter
which concerns his life, then it is not amiss to warn thy friend, to the
end he may be provided against such a mischief; but the carrying of every idle
tale betwixt man and man, does much hurt, and sets whole households together
by the ears. Again, he which is a carrier of tales, can not truly deliver a
man's speech, without adding or diminishing: and either of these two do alter
the whole property of the speech which was first delivered, and it so falls
out many times, that the Talebearer brings himself into many quarrels, and
to be envied on both sides: therefore, he which can hear, and see, and say
little, will find most quietness, for little said is soon answered: but he
that talks much, can never place all his words well, nor please every man's
humor: and surely Tale-bearers are the breeders of great mischief.

For many times upon others words some do bear malice one to another, without
cause of desert, and yet occasion is taken, and perhaps none given neither;
the one party does not know of the malice the other bears him of a long time,
and this is not well, for if thou be grieved, reveal thy mind, and make a
bolt or a shaft of it quickly, either to end it with weapons or with words or
by the persuasions of friends, as occasion shall serve, when it comes in
question, and then afterward be friends, but at no hand, let no envious hatred
remain in thy heart against any person, of what condition soever; but rather
go unto him which spoke ill words against thee, and ask him in courteous
means, but not in outrage and anger, until thou hear his tale; for the
Talebearer it may be, is in the fault, in telling a tale to make a quarrel,
when there is none meant.

Meddle not with great men which are above thy calling, for though they wrong
thee, and that thou have a good quarrel), yet thou can get little by
maintaining such a quarrel; for might (oftentimes) overcomes right, and the
weakest goes commonly to the walls: then is it better to bear the burden of
the mighty, and endure their malice with patience and let such quarrels
slip, rather then stir further in them, lest it be thy overthrow: and, he
carries the most honorable mind, which in talking of his enemy, can so
bridle his affections, as to use no railing, nor indecent speeches behind his
enemies back, for he that does so, dishonesteth himself: besides, those which
hear him, will judge that he had rather fight with his tongue then with his
sword.

Again, a man of great power and authority ought not to offer wrong unto any
man of meaner sort: for it has been often seen, that a worm being trodden
upon, will turn again; and many poor men will rather loose their lives, if
so twere they durst adventure to challenge the rich for fear of the Law, I do
mean when they are oppressed, wronged, and disgraced by the rich and mighty
men; for the Law is a quirke to restrain or to check poor men's wills, for
it does hamper and temper, and bring them into subjection: and as the old
Proverb goes, The rich men have the Law in their own hands.

Even as the ignorant and unskillful do many times fear to displease a
swaggerer or a common quarreller; even so poor men are afraid to offend the
rich.

Now concerning a rich man, I remember a pretty example or a tale, and as I
heard it, you shall hear it, There was a Gentleman which built a gallant fair
house, whom I will leave namelesse, but he had many ploughs and carriages for
timber, lime, and stones; some serving his present need, for love, some for
money, and some for fear (as you shall hear) for at night, (when the carriage
was ended) the Gentleman called them one after an other, and unto the first he
said; What have you earned? Sir (said he) I came for love, and not for money. I
thank you (said the Gentleman.) So then he asked another, saying Sir, what
came you for? Sir (said he) I am but a poor man, and I came for money. And so
the Gentleman paid him his wages: Then he called an other, and asked him
wherefore he came, or what he had deserved? Sir (said he) I came not to you for
love, nor for money, but only for fear of your displeasure. Said the
Gentleman, why art thou afraid of me which never did thee hurt in all my life?
Yea, but sir (said he) I have seen many poor men enuyed, wronged, and
imprisoned many times for ill will by the rich, when they have but little
deserved it; thereby showing, that some rich men will bear such malice unto a
poor man, if he shall deny him such carriage, or if he do not help him in
the harvest, or if he shall deny him the selling of a horse, ground, or
cattle, that the Gentleman has a mind unto; for many of them think that a
poor man should deny them nothing, but if they do, a grudging hatred
continues until they have revenged it; but if in a long time they cannot
find a hole in his coat, whereby to revenge their malice: yet when a press
comes, then they put him forth for a Soldier, although there be twenty
others in the same Parish, which would willingly serve, and likewise that might
be far better spared, and a great deal more fit, for an unwilling servant
seldom does his master good service.

Chap. X. The tricks of a Coward.
THE first reason which I will set down, whereby you may know a coward, is, by
the lading of himself with weapons; for I have known a very fearful man to
see to, and yet a coward, carry a Welsh hook upon his back, a close hilted
Sword and Dagger, yet (mistake me not) for I do not call every man that is so
weaponed, a coward, but stand still alittle, and you shall know who I mean.

When a man (upon a good quarrel) does challenge a coward into the field, it
may be it comes to this point; Where shall we meet says the one? In such a
place or such a place says the other; but in the end, they make a secret
conclusion, and choice of a place is agreed upon; but then, if the coward go
into the field at all, he will be sure to go where he will not meet with
his enemy, but to one of the aforementioned places, and there he will stay a
while, and if any company come by, he will tell them, that he stays to fight
with such a man, because they shall note him for a tall man of his hands: and
then at his coming back again, amongst his companions, he will brag and
boast that he has been in the field, to meet with such a man, and he came
not; when the other all the while was at the place where they concluded to have
met.

Again, some cowards will so dare and brag out a man in company, with such
swaggering words, whereby the heaters should think there were not a better man
to be found: and if it be in a Fair or Market, then he will draw his weapons,
because he knows that he shall be soon parted, for the people will say, that
such a one and such a one made a great fray to day, but I account this but
pot-valour, or a Cowards fray to fight in the street, for a man can give no
due commendations of manhood unto such fighters, for there is no valor in it.

Again, I have known a Coward cunningly challenge a very sufficient man, and
they have met in the field, but at their meeting, the Coward will say thus unto
him, Now I see thou art a man, and I will take thy part against all men, but I
will never draw my Sword against thee, that which I did was but to try thee.

Also a cunning Coward, when he has wronged or mis-vsed a man, the party
grieved does challenge the field of him, then he will bear it out with great
bragges and high looks, enough to fear any man, that will be feared with
words, showing himself outwardly as though he would fight indeed; for the
Coward will say unto the challenger, Thou will not meet me, if I should
appoint thee a place, for thou dare nor answer me: for be it known unto
thee, if I vnsheathe my Sword, I will not draw him in vain; but now if he see
these bragges can not dismay nor assuage the fury of the other, but that he
will needs fight, then he assayeth other ways, if it be one of his
acquaintance, he will say, The world shall not speak of it, that we two
should fall out: or, if it be to an inferior, then he will stand upon his
gentility, saying that he will not do him that credit, for thou art a base
fellow, a fellow of no fashion, to compare with me. I have known in a strange
place, that a scuruy base fellow will stand so much upon his gentilitie, and
think to make the world believe he is a great man in his own Country. Also,
in a Tavern or such like place, if there be company ready to hold him, then
he will draw his Dagger upon very small occasion, showing himself resolute, as
though he would fight with the devil; and then the company (with alittle
persuasion) brings them friends, which I discommend not, but I discommend the
falling out about a pipe of Tobacco, or a cup of Wine or Beer. But of this I
have spoken something before, and shall have occasion to speak more at large
of it hereafter; But first, to end this I have in hand, many a Coward may say,
when he has lived so long in the world until the world is weary of his
company, I may be the best man in the world, for I was never yet tried, nor
never drew my Sword in earnest in all my life hitherto: again, it is good
sleeping in a whole skin.

And a wise or a valorous man may even say so as well as a Coward: for I say a
man may very well answer a good quarrel, if occasion be offered, yet sleep in
a whole skin; why shall we fear to go to our beds, because some die in
their beds; some die at Sea, and therefore shall we fear to cross the Sea;
some fall by chance, shall we never therefore rise for fear of falling? And
what is all this? Nothing, but to show, that there is less danger in fighting
a good quarrel with skill and discretion, upon cold blood: but of this I have
spoken sufficiently already, if words would serve. But if I should write a
whole Volume of one matter, yet it would serve to small purpose to some; and so
where we left there we will begin, for what I have said before, it is but as
it were a deaw, but this last shower shall wet them to the skin; a Coward
will have a Sword or a Rapier, for length (in a manner) like a half Pike: but
since the use of short Swords came, you cannot know them by that mark, as you
might before, for many of them are got into the fashion, and it is the fittest
weapon that ever came for their purpose; for short swords are worn both of one
and other, more for the fashion then for any other purpose: but because men of
good worth do wear them, therefore I will not call it the fools fashion,
but let every man alone with his humor. Again, a Coward will have as good
and as gallant a weapon as may be gotten for money; but I do not commend the
man by the largeness nor goodness of his weapons, neither he that has many
hurts and scarres about his body. There is no due commendations to be given
of a Judge, by his skarlet Gown; neither can a man commend the skilfulnes of
the Mariner by his wearing of a great whistle: gold is not certainly known
to be gold, before it is tried, every thing is not as it seems to be for
many a man carries the shape and personage of a man: but when they come to the
touch like gold to be tried, prove but shadows, as that which is like gold
many times does prove worse then Copper: even so, there is no certain true
report can be given of a man touching manhood upon the first sight, without
some trial. You shall seldom see a Coward use his weapon, except it be upon a
drunken humor, or else, when he is driven to it by extremity, and that he
sees no remedy, but that he must needs fight, but he will many times be
drawing in some Alehouse or Tavern, and there he will be fencing with him,
and showing his tricks, thinking to make the company believe, that he is an
excellent fellow of his hands: and there many will be hewing of bed-postes, or
table-boords, or many such like tricks he will use: then some Cowards will (by
casting abroad of libels) and by night-walking, do many mischievous tricks,
only to revenge a malice which they bear in mind, because they can not
revenge it manfully, and yet a Coward will grieve and fret if justly he hear
any other to be commended of any man for his manhood and valor, for he would
have no man better then himself. And if such a one bear office in City or
Town, he will at no hand abide to hear, that a master of Defense should
inhabit in the place where he governs.

Also if any other commend a man that is a man indeed, a coward will discommend
him saying, he is no body; or he is not the man you take him for; with such
like disabling speeches, for if a coward cannot disgrace a man with deeds to
his face, then he will deprive him with words behind his back.

Also a coward delights to breed quarrels betwixt man and man, and to set
such as are named to be men of their hands, together by the ears by false
reports, and by carrying of tales, and by making of molehills mountains, of
half a word a long tale, to the hurt of others, and no good to themselves: and
what is the chief cause of all cowardly minds but only ignorance, and want
of skill: but to conclude, never trust a coward in his fury, nor suffer him not
to come nearer then the point of thy rapier, and there let him tell his tale,
but let him have no advantage upon thee by no kind of illusions, especially if
he be thy professed enemy.

That he is a coward which practices the throwing of a dagger or the darting
of a rapier, I will not say, but he which puts it in practice upon a man, is
a coward, for if he kill a man with such a trick, in my mind it is pity but
he should die for it: and so I will end with that example of a cowardly
murderer of one Cosbe, whose murdering hands by a cousening device bereaved
the Lord of Burke of his life, and as I heard it, thus it was: a quarrel grew
between them, and the field was appointed, where they both met, and being ready
to charge each other, Cosbe said my Lord you have spurs which may annoy you:
therefore if you please put them off, and even as he was vnbuckling of his
spurs, this cowardly and murdering minded Cosbe ran him through with a mortal
wound, whereof he died presently.

Now to my own knowledge, my Lord Burke was very skillful in his weapons, and
sufficient to have answered any man being equally weaponed, or upon equal
terms, therefore hard was his hap to meet with such a cowardly murderer, for
his death is lamented of many, and Cosby was hanged for it.

Yet touching this matter, here follows another example, as I heard it I will
declare it: thus, there was a murderer who escaping the pitifully hands of
the merciful Judge, after he had killed two men, being taken and apprehended
for the third murder, and being arraigned before the same Judge which had
before showed pity, began now to condemn this murderer, and give the
sentence of death, and so began to declare to this murderer that had small
grace, which could not beware being twice warned, but must now kill the third
man: therefore thou (says the Judge) well deseruest death, and death thou
shall have: when the murderer saw that he must die, he said thus unto the
Judge: My Lord you do me wrong to condemn me for the killing of three men,
for it was you that killed two of them: yea said the Judge, how can that be?
marry thus: if you had hanged me for the first I had not killed the other two:
therefore it is pity in my mind, that a manslayer should live to kill two
men, but to be hanged for the first if it be not in his own defense, or upon a
very good quarrel, and so I will strike sail for a while.

CHAP. XI. Questions and Answers. Scholar.
I Have harkened all this while unto your discourse, the which I like very well
of, but now I am desirous if it please you to be instructed with some of your
skill.

Master. At what weapon are you desirous to learn.


Scholar. Such as you think fit for my defense.


Master. Then I hold it necessary for thee to learn the perfect use of six
kinds of weapons, not that thou should still be armed with so many weapons,
but with the skill of them, for that will not burden thee nothing at all: for
thou may in travel by chance meet at sundry times, with sundry men, which
are armed with sundry kind of weapons, now if thou be provided before hand
with skill at such a weapon, as by chance thou may meet withal, knowing the
danger thou will the better prevent the mischief.


Scholar. What be the six weapons which you would have me to learn.


Master. The first and two principal weapons are the rapier and dagger, and
the staff, the other four are the back sword, the single Rapier, the long
sword and dagger, and the short sword and dagger, but with the two former
weapons thou may encounter by skill with any man in the world, the rapier and
dagger against any weapon of the same length, at single hand and with a staff
against any two handed weapon, as against the welsh hook, two hand sword, the
Halberd, Partisan, and glove, or any other weapon of the like advantage: but
provided always thou must be sure armed with skill at those two especially:
and with all the rest if thou can, for then may thou be the bolder to
encounter with any man at any of the other, if thy enemy charge thee upon the
sudden with a contrary weapon, thou will presently know what thy enemy can
do with his weapon, which if thou have no skill in, it will seem the more
fearful unto thee.

For if Golias had been experienced in the cunning of a sling, he would not
have condemned David so rashly, nor made so light account of him as he did: but
if thou have skill with such a weapon, as thou art to encounter against, it
will be nothing troublesome unto thee, for there is no way to hit, but there is
a way to defend, as thou shall here more at large, but first tell me what thou
art, and thy bringing up.


Scholar. I was a yeomans son, and always brought up idle under my father,
but now my father is dead, and that little which he left me for the most part
I have consumed and spent, wherefore I pray you direct me my course, by some of
your good counsel, for I have little to trust to, but only my hands, therefore
I am willing to learn any thing which may gain me a good report, and something
beneficial for my maintenance.


Master. Indeed means to live and a good name withal, is more then gold, and
because thou show thy self willing to be instructed, thou shall hear
briefly what I would do if my self were in thy case, for if I should enter
into large discourses I might thereby well make thee weary with the hearing of
it, but perhaps never the wiser, and so thereby thou might well give me
occasion to account the time very ill spent in writing of it. Nevertheless I
will reckon little of my labor, for I am in hope to do thee good, for thou
must or should know not only how to use and govern thy weapon, but also thy
self, in all companies, and in all places, where thou shall happen to come;
for kind and courteous behavior wins favor and love wheresoever thou
go, but much the better if it be tempered with manhood and skill of weapons.
Now some will say that skill in weapons is good most chiefly for gentlemen, but
I say it should be in all men, for I have known and seen many poor men's sons
come to great honor and credit, and chiefly it was because they had skill in
weapons, wherefore in my mind it is the most excellent quality of all both for
high and low, rich and poor. But when thou art experienced at thy weapon, I
would wish thee to make choice of one of those three exercises for thy
continual expenses and maintenance so long as thou live, and not live like a
drone upon other men's labors, for least in time if thou were never so good a
man, yet every one would wax weary of thy company.


Scholar. I pray you, what be the three Exercises which you would counsel me
to take my choice of?


Master. Marry, thy self being of reasonable good years, and having neither
lands, nor but alittle living left thee, choose whether thou will go learn
some trade or occupation, or else go into the wars, or be a serving man; for
when thou have skill in thy weapon, thou must have some means to maintain
thine expenses; for idle hands will make a hungry belly, and a hungry belly
must needs have meat, and meat will not be bought in the market for honesty
without money.


Scholar. Which of these Exercises would you advise me to follow?


Master. I commend them all, but yet an occupation is a more certain stay
unto a man, both in his youth and in his age, then any of the other two are;
and as thou art in years, so ought thou to be the more witty, if it be not
so, it should be so, and a man of reason will the sooner be his crafts-master.
A man is never too old to learn, especially any thing that may be to the good
and profit of the commonwealth; and it is better to learn late then never: and
he that has a trade, let him look unto it, and he which will not labor, let
him not eat, says Saint Paul.


Schol. What trade would you have me to learn?


Master. Such a trade or occupation, as thy mind bends most unto, and then
to apply thy self to it, and follow it, and strive by honest means and
painful labor to be rich, for thou may be poor when thou will, but there
is no trade good to him which will not to follow it, for he that has never so
many trades, and yet gives his mind to drunkenness, and loves to lead an
idle and loytering life: such a one will never thrive, but fit in an Alehouse,
and complain, that the world is hard, and that work is very scant; indeed,
so it is with such a one, for a man can seldom find them in their own
houses, whereby to put work into their hands, but those that do look for
work, and attend it, need never to want work, but will always be in other
men's work, or else they will be able (by their good husbandry) to set
themselves aworke, and it is a very bad commodity, that will not yield money
at one time or other.


Do you understand me? if not, I will make it more plain, hearken to that
which follows, then above all, give not thy mind to ranging or running from
Town to Town, or from Country to Country, for a rolling stone will never
gather moss, the Grasshopper will rather die then go out of the grass; and
thou (with good behavior) may better live with a groat in thine own
Country, then with a pound in a strange place, for in a strange place,
although thou be of good behavior, yet many will fear thee, and be loath to
give thee credit, and will think, if thou were of good behavior, thou
should have had no need to come out of thine own Country: Again, thy
flying away will be a great discredit unto thee, if thou think to come home
again; for every man almost will be loath to put credit, or any thing of
value into the hands of a ranger, because that they are not resolved that thy
mind is settled to stay in thine own Country, when thou do turn from thy
race again. Many men there are that consume their time in ranging abroad, and
at the last, seeing the vanity of the world, they recall themselves, and repent
of the time which they have consumed in travel: but then they have experience
although no money; now Experience is no coiner, nor a tradesman worth a pin
without his tools; for what avails it to be a cunning Goldsmiths, and have
neither gold nor silver: few there are that will trust a traveler any further
then they can see him, especially, if he have been one that has served as a
Soldier in a foreign Country: therefore, although home be homely, endeavor
thy self to live by honest and good means, and be contented with thine homely
home; but beware, spend not Michaelmasse rent in Midsummer quarter abroad, as
many bad husbands use to do.

Now if a trade be too tedious for thee to learn, or too painful for thee to
follow, then go thou unto the wars, and serve either by Sea or Land, as thy
affections shall best lead thee unto: but in seeking by the wars to get
wealth, if thou loosest thy life while thou art young, thou need not to care
for old age; yet by the wars (if fortune serve) but to speak more
Christian-like (if God will) thou may get that in one hour, which (with
good discretion and government) thou may be the better for, so long as thou
live: the goods which do come by the wars, are neither light come by, The
wars are not like throwing of snow balls: far deceived are they that so
think.
nor godlily gotten (in my mind;) yet many think that wealth gotten by the
wars, is easily gotten; for so it appears by the prodigal and vain
spending of it: wherefore I would have thee furnish thy self with Discretion
and Knowledge before hand, that thereby thou may the better use wealth when
thou have it; but then thou must not abuse it, as many other Soldiers have
done heretofore: for I have known many get both goods and money by the wars,
but have made no other reckoning, but as one would say, lightly come lightly
go; and so suffering it to melt away like butter in the Sun: therefore if
thou happen, by the wars, upon that may do thee good, keep it warily, and
spend it wisely: for it is said, a dog shall have a day, and a man shall have
his time; but if he let Time slip, she is bauld behind, and therefore no hold
to be taken of her after her back is once turned; for I have known many by
the wars, get at one voyage, enough to live by all their lives long, if with
discretion it had bin governed; but they have consumed it in so short a time,
that a man would think it impossible; and then to the wars again they go in
hope of the like fortune, but they have not in seven years, nay all their
life time got so much, as they spent in one day, when they had crowns.

Goods gotten by the wars are like a live Bird in the hand, which, the hand
no sooner opened but she strait flies away.
Then consider with thy self, that if thou do light upon wealth, that thou
come not light by it, if thou get it by the wars, though indeed it is
gotten in an hour, yet it is gotten with great hazard of thy life, and no
doubt it is displeasing to God, for goods gotten by the wars serve but for
spending money for the time present; those which do save them, and hoord them
up, they are consumed before two generations do pass, yea though it were
abundance, it comes to nothing, as in my farewell to Plimmouth more at large
appears.

Now (in my mind) the third and the worst choice I have left till the last,
and that is a seruing-mans life, yet it is as it happens, for some happen
into good service, and some again spend seven years, yea all their life
time, and so they grow the older, little the wiser, nor never a whit the
richer; and some of them never care so they have from hand to mouth, nor never
think upon a rainy day until it come, and gentlemen are wise for they will
not keep a dog and bark themselves, neither will they keep a cat except she
will catch mice; therefore if thou will be a seruing-man thou must take great
pains, otherwise thou will have small gains at the end of thy service; yea
though thou be never so painful and dutiful, yet when thou look to receive
thy reward, there may be such great fault found in thy service, that all the
golden words and fair promises which thou have been deluded and haled forward
withal, they may all come to nothing except thy bare wages, there may be a
bill of caueling put in for the rest, saying if thou had been an honest man,
thou should have had this or that, if thou live never so uprightly, yet
there may be faults found, for it is a very easy matter to find a staff to
beat a dog withal, but because I cannot well display the life of a
seruingman, but either I shall displease the Master or the man, or both;
therefore I will here conclude, and leave the rest to thy daily experience, and
so for a while harken unto the skill of weapons.

CHAP. XII. Shows of seven principal rules whereon true defense is grounded.
1 A good guard. 2 True observing of distance. 3 To know the place. 4 To take
time. 5 To keep space. 6 Patience. 7 Often practice.
THe first is to learn a good and a sure guard for the defense of thy body, as
when you come to the use of weapons, as here presently after shall follow, and
when thou have thy guard it is not enough to know it, but to keep it so long as
thou art within reach or danger of thy enemy.

To observe distance, by which is meant that thou should stand so far off
from thine enemy, as thou can, but reach him when thou do step forth with
thy blow or thrust, and thy foremost foot and hand must go together, the
which distance may be twelve foot with a rapier, or with asword four foot
long, and yet thy best foot which should be the hindermost foot of a right
handed man, should be mored fast and keep his standing without moving an
inch, for then he will be the readier to draw back thy fore foot and body into
the right place of distance again for that thou must do upon every charge,
whether thou hit thy enemy or not; whereas if in stepping forth with thy
fore-foot, when thou do charge thy enemy either with blow or thrust, thou
suffer thy hinder foot to dregge in after the other, then thou breakest thy
distance, and thereby endangerest thy body.

There is no way better to get the true observation of distance, but by often
practice either with thy friend, or else privately in a chamber against a wall,
standing twelve foot off with thy hindermost foot, and thy weapon four foot
long or there about, for a good guard and distance are the maine and principal
points of all.

To know the place, this may be taken three ways, as this, the place of thy
weapons, the place of defense and the place of offense: the place for the
holding of thy weapons, thou shall know when thou come to it as I said
before, but it is chiefly meant here the place of offense; thou must mark
which is the nearest part of thine enemy toward thee, and which lies most
unregarded, whether it be his dagger hand, his knee, or his leg, or where thou
may best hurt him at a large distance without danger to thy self, or without
killing of thine enemy.

To take time, that is to say when opportunity is proffered thee, either by his
lying unregarded or upon thy enemies profer, then make a quick answer, I mean
it must be done upon the very motion of his profer, thou must defend and seek
to offend all at once, for thou must not suffer thy enemy to recover his guard,
for if thou do thou loosest thy advantage. But thou must answer him more
quicker then I can speak it, for if thou loose thy answer, and charge thy
enemy when he is guarded, thou give thy enemy that advantage which thou
might have had thy self, for he which makes the first assault does
endanger himself most, if he be not very expert and cunning in his business,
otherwise a man of reasonable skill may hurt him by making a quick answer.

To keep space this may be conceived two ways; the one in the space between
thy enemy and thy self, this I call distance, and I have already spoken of
it; but the space which in this place I will speak of, is to advise thee to
keep a certain space betwixt every assault, I mean if thou charge thy enemy
either with blow or thrust, recover thy weapons into their place, and draw thy
self into thy guard again, and so preparing thy self for to defend, and
likewise to make a fresh assault with discretion, but not charging thy enemy
rashly or furiously, for hastiness is foolishnes: for if fury have the upper
hand, and so you both strike and thrust, without reason and judgment, I say in
such a case the skilfullest man that is, may be so well hit as he hit another.

The next is patience, and that is one of the greatest virtues that can be in a
man: the Wise man says, he is a fool which cannot govern himself, and he
very unfit to rule which cannot rule himself; therefore, though thou be hasty
or choleric by nature, and by crossing thou art moved unto anger; yet I say,
let the bridle of Reason and Judgment so govern and overrule thy hasty
affections, that in no case Anger get the upper hand; But of this there is more
at large spoken in the eight chapter. Now the last thing that I will note
here, is often practice, for without practice the Proverb says, a man may
forget his Pater noster: for practice (with moderation) is, not only the
healthiest thing in the world for the body: but it is likewise as defensive
for the same. For skill to every reasonable man is a friend, so that with
moderation it be used, and so long as it remains in those of good temper; for
unto such, skill brings no more presumption nor fury then as if they had it
not: for in the field, those which I mean will use it as if they were in a
School, by which means such have great advantage of the ignorant and
unskillful; for those which are unskillful, are neither certain of their
defense nor offense; but what they do is upon a kind of foolish bold
hardiness, or as I may say by hap-hazzard or chance noddy: and therefore
(gentle Reader) resolve upon skill and knowledge which follows here
immediately.

The true guard for the defense, either of blow, or thrust, with Rapier and
Dagger, or Sword and Dagger.
Keep thy rapier hand so low as the pocket of thy hose at the arms end,
without bowing the elbow joint, and keep the hilt of thy dagger right with thy
left cheek, and the point something stooping toward the right shoulder, and
bear him out stiff at the arms end, without bowing thine elbow joint
likewise, and the point of thy Rapier two inches within the point of thy
dagger, neither higher, nor lower; but if the point of thy rapier be two or
three inches short of touching thy dagger, it is no matter, but if they join
it is good; likewise, keep both your points so high as you may see your enemy
clearly with both your eyes, betwixt your rapier and dagger, and bowing your
head something toward the right shoulder, and your body bowing forwards, and
both thy shoulders, the one so near thine enemy as the other, and the thombe
of thy rapier hand, not upon thy rapier, according unto the usual fashion of
the vulgar sort, but upon the nail of thy forefinger, which will lock thine
hand the stronger about the handle of thy rapier, and the heel of thy right
foot should join close to the middle joint of the great toe of thy left
foot, according to this Picture, yet regard chiefly the words rather then the
Picture.



Carry the edge of thy rapier upward, and downward, for then thou shall
defend a blow upon the edge of thy rapier, by bearing thy rapier after the rule
of the Backe-sword, for this is the strongest and the surest carriage of him.

But now it is but a vain thing to go about to practice after my direction,
except thou understand my meaning, and follow my counsel, as by words so
plain as I can, I have set down, both before and after: for if thou observe
one thing, and not an other, it will profit thee but little, as thus: if thou
place thy weapons in order; and then, if thy hand, foot, or body be out of
order, then it will be to small purpose to proceed in thy practice: again, if
thou frame thy body right, and thy weapons, and thy hand, and thy foot; yet
if thou do not observe a true distance withal, then thy practice will be
little available to thee: wherefore at the first beginning of thy practice,
take a good aduisement, and be perfect by often reading of this Book, so to
begin well; for if thou have been used to set thy feet abroad in thy former
practice, as most men do, then it will be hard for thee to leave thy old wont.

Now, if thou will break thy self of that fashion and practice after my
rules, then will I show thee by and by; for when thou have my fashion, thou
may go to thine own again when thou will, if in trial thou find it
better.

The best way to bring thy feet to a sure standing, both for defense and
offense, is when thou do practice with thy friend or companion; at the first
get thy back to the wall, and let him that plays with thee stand about
twelve foot distance, and set thy left heel close to the wall, and thy right
foot heel to the great joint of the left foot great toe, and when thou
intendest to offend thy enemy, either with blow or thrust, then step forth
with thy right foot, and hand together, but keep thy left foot fast moared
like an anchor, to pluck home thy body and thy right foot into his place and
distance again; use this fashion but three or four times, and it will bring
thee to a true standing with thy foot, and it will be as easy to thee as any
other way; whereas if thou practice in a large room without any stop to set
thy foot against, then will thy left foot be always creeping away, so that
although thou would refrain the setting abroad of thy feet, yet thou can
not, especially if thou have been used to set them abroad heretofore.

Now your body and weapons being thus placed as aforesaid, if your enemy
strike a blow at you, either with sword or rapier, bear your rapier against
the blow, so well as your dagger according unto the rule of the Backe-sword,
for in taking the blow double you shall the more surely defend your head, if
the blow do chance to light near the point of your dagger, for if you trust
to your dagger only, the blow may hap to glance over the point of your
dagger, and endanger your head, and having defended the blow double (as
aforesaid) presently turn down the point of your rapier toward your enemies
thigh, or any part of your enemies body, as you list your self; and with
your thrust step forth also with your foot and hand together, and so making
a quick answer, you may endanger your enemy in what place you will your
self, before he recover his guard and distance again, and always set your
rapier foot right before the other, and so near the one to the other as you
can; and if thou be right handed then thy right foot must be foremost, if left
handed, then thy left foot, and standing thus in thy guard, look for thy
advantage, I mean where thine enemy lies most unguarded; but first thou must
be perfect in the knowledge of the true and perfect guard thy self, so shall
thou know the better where thine enemy lies open, then thou must step
forth with thy fore foot, and hand together, to offend thine enemy in such a
place as thou find unguarded; but so soon as thou have presented thy
thrust, whether thou hit or miss, fall back again to recover thy guard and
distance so soon as thou can, but stand always fast on thine hindermost
foot, I mean whether thou strike or thrust, and then shall thou recover thy
guard; and having recovered thy weapons in their right place, then thou must
also trauerse thy ground so leisurably, that thou may be sure to have one
foot firm on good ground before thou pluckest up the other; for else, going
fast about, thou may quickly be down if the ground be not even. Also have a
special care that thou be not too busy in making of play, though choler or
stomach provoke thee thereunto. Furthermore, in standing in thy guard, thou
must keep thy thighs close together, and the knee of thy fore leg bowing
back-ward rather then forward, but thy body bowing forward; for the more thou
hollowest thy body, the better, and with less danger shall thou break thine
enemies thrust, before it comes near to endanger thy body; and when thou
breakest a thrust, thou must but let fall the point of thy dagger, but not thy
dagger arm, for some will throw their dagger arm back behind them when they
break a thrust; he that so does cannot defend a second thrust if his enemy
should charge him again suddenly.

The reasons of this guard.
FIrst, the points of your weapons being closed, your enemy cannot offend you
with a wrist blow, which otherwise may be struck to your face betwixt your
points: likewise, there is a falling thrust that may hit any man which lies
open with his points by following it into his face or breast, and thrusting it
home withal: also, if you carry your rapier point under your dagger, your own
rapier may hinder you, for by turning down of your daggar point, to defend the
body from your enemies point, according unto the first of the four defensible
ways, as hereafter follows: then your own dagger may hit your own rapier,
and so your rapier will be as it were a stumbling block, so that you cannot
discharge your enemies thrust clean from your body; and also by striking your
dagger upon your rapier will be a hindrance unto you, that you cannot make a
quick answer, by chopping out your point presently upon your defense: for if
you have any hindrance at all, then your chief time of offense is spent, for
before you can recover your rapier, your enemy will have recovered his guard,
and he being in his guard your proffer of offense is in vain: for if you will
hit your enemy, your offense and defense must be done all with one motion,
whereas if you continue a space betwixt your defense and your offense, then is
your best time of offense spent, for when your enemy charge you, either with
blow or thrust, at that very instant time, his face, his rapier, arm,
shoulder, knee, and leg are all discovered, and lie open, except the
oppressor be very cunning in recovering his guard hastily again, or he may
defend himself with his dagger, if he bear him stiffely out at the arms end,
for in your offense the dagger hand should be borne out so far as the rapier
hand goes, which must be done by practice and great carfulness; for many
when they do make their assault, they will put out their rapier, and pluck in
their dagger, thereby endangering themselves greatly: for except that the
dagger arm be kept straight, and borne out stiff, it is hard to defend
either blow or thrust.

A thrust may be defended four ways.
THe first is with the dagger, only by turning of the point down, and
turning thy hand-wrist about withal, without bowing the elbow joint of thy
dagger arm, but only turning thy dagger round, making as it were a round
circle, and so presently bring up the point of thy dagger in his place again.

Now the second defense is with the dagger likewise, but then you must bear
the hilt of your dagger so low as your girdle-steed, and the point more
upright then is described in the first picture, and in your defense of a
thrust, you must bear your dagger hand stiff over your body, without letting
fall the point but still keeping him upright.

The third way to break a thrust, is, with the single rapier; this defense
will defend all thy body from a thrust against a rapier and a dagger; and
likewise it is a sure defense for thine hand, if thou have not a close hilted
dagger, when thy enemy does proffer a thrust, pluck in thy dagger hand, and
put out thy rapier arm, and bear him over thy body, the point bowing toward
thy left side, breaking the thrust with the edge of thy rapier, keeping thy
point upright: but when I come to the single rapier, then you shall see it more
at large.

The fourth way is to defend a thrust with both your weapons together, and that
you may do three manner of ways, either with the points of both your weapons
upwards, or both downward, upward you may frame your self into two gards, the
first is according as I have described before, the points being close according
to the picture, so carry them both away together against your enemies thrust
breaking toward your left side; the other high guard is to put your rapier on
the outside of your dagger, and with your dagger make a cross, as it were, by
joining him in the midst of your rapier, so high as your breast, and your
dagger hilt in his usual place, and to defend your thrust, turn down the
point of your rapier suddenly, and force him down with your dagger, by
letting them fall both together: this way you may defend a thrust before it
come within three foot of your body; and this way defends the thrust of a
staff, having but only a rapier and dagger, as you shall hear more when I
come to the staff: for it is good to be provided with the best way, if a
sudden occasion be offered: and for the blow of a staff, you may very easily
defend with a Rapier and Dagger, by bearing him double; and so having defended
the blow, go in hastily upon him, for there is no standing out long against a
staff, and so likewise upon defense of a thrust you must be very nimble in
your going in within the point of his staff, I mean so soon as your enemies
thrust is passed under your Rapier arm, for that way the thrust of the staff
should go.

Three manner of ways for the holding of a Rapier.
THere are three ways for the holding of a Rapier, the one with the thumb
forward or upon the Rapier blade, and that I call the natural fashion, there
is another way, and that is with the whole hand within the pummell of thy
Rapier, and the thumb locking in of the forefinger, or else they must both
join at the least: this is a good holding at single Rapier.

Then the third is but to have only the forefinger and thy thumb within the
pummell of thy Rapier, and thy other three fingers about thy pummell, and bear
the button of thy pummell against the inside of thy little finger; this is
called the Stokata fashion, and these two last are the surest and strongest
ways: after a little practice thou may use them all three in thy practice,
and then repose thy self upon that which thou find best, but at some times,
and for some purpose all these kinds of holding thy Rapier may stead thee, for
a man may perform some manner of slips and thrusts, with one of these three
sorts of holding thy weapon; and thou can not do the same with neither of
the other: as thus, thou may put in a thrust with more celeritie, holding
him by the pummell, and reach further then thou can do, if thou hold him on
either of the two other fashions.

Again, thou may turn in a slip, or an ouerhand thrust, if thou put thy
thumb upon thy Rapier according as I have set it down, calling it the
natural fashion, and is the first of the three ways for holding of thy
Rapier; and this fashion will be a great strength to thee, to give a wrist
blow, the which blow a man may strike with his Rapier, because it is of small
force, and consumes little time, and neither of the other two fashions of
holding will not perform neither of those three things; for if thou hold thy
rapier either of the two second ways, thou can not turn in a slip, nor an
ouer-hand thrust, nor give a wrist blow so speedily, nor so strong: wherefore
it is good to make a change of the holding of thy weapon for thine own
benefit, as thou shall see occasion: and likewise to make a change of thy
guard, according as thou see thy best advantage; I mean if thou be hardly
matched, then betake thee unto thy surest guard, but if thou be matched with an
unskillful man, then with skill thou may defend thy self, although thou lie
at random.

The reason that your points should be so high, as you may see your enemy
plainly and clearly under them, is for a sure defense of a blow, if your
enemy should charge you therewith to either side the head, then bear them
both double together, and having defended the blow, presently turn down the
point of your Rapier toward your enemies thigh, and with turning your knuckles
inward, step forth with foot and hand together, whether you hitte or miss,
retreit nimbly into your guard and distance again.

And although I do advise you to keep the point of your Rapier so high, yet
withal I do warn you, that you may have a special care to fall your point,
and with all thrust him out, if your enemy do ouerreach or press in upon
you, whether it be upon choler, or upon stomach, or upon a kind of foolish
bold hardiness, or if he make a passage upon you, or if he do break
distance by any of those ways, although he do it never so actiuelie, yet
may you defend your self with your Dagger and either offend your enemy by a
sudden falling the point, and with the same motion chop in with a thrust to
that part which lies most discovered as you may quickly perceive when you see
his lying.

The cunningest man that is, and if he meet with one skillful, with whom he
is to encounter withal, cannot before hand say in such a place I will sure hit
thee; no more, then a gamester when he goes to play can say before he begin,
that he will sure win, for if he do, he may be proved a lier if his cunning
were never so good.

So that before hand you cannot determine where to hit your enemy, but when you
see your enemies guard, then it is easy to judge where it is open, if thou
know a close guard thy self, for he which cannot write himself, can give
but small Judgment whether another write well or ill, and if thine enemy do
incroach within thy distance, then be doing with him betimes in the very
instant of his motion whether it be motion of his body, or the motion of his
weapon, or in the motion of both together: put out thy point, but not to far,
but as thou may have thy rapier under command for thy own defense, and also
to provide him ready again to make a full thrust home upon a greater
advantage, for if thou answer a full thrust home, in the instant of thy enemies
assault, thou may endanger thy self if thy enemy do falsify his thrust,
and therefore make your thrust short at the first, or if your enemy do bear
his points any thing abroad, then you may fall in betwixt them, either to his
face or breast, or if his fore foot stand two foot distant or less from the
other if he stand not close, then you may hurt him in the knee or leg,
either with thrust or blow as he stands in his guard without any danger to
your self, and that is no killing place.

Likewise it is said before look under both your weapons, if with on eye you
look over either of weapons, you may be hit one the same side, either face,
head, or shoulder, either with thrust or blow before you can put up either of
your weapons in his place to defend it, and this know and remember it well, it
is the nature of an Englishman to strike with what weapon soever he fights
with all, and not one in twenty but in fury and anger will strike unto no
other place but only to the head, therefore always if you fight with rapier
and dagger, yet expect a blow so well as a thrust, and always defend the blow
double as aforesaid, but if your rapier point be down under your dagger, you
cannot put him up time enough to defend a blow, but must take it single on the
dagger, or on the pate, for if your skill were never so good trusting to the
dagger only you may be deceived by reason of the sharpness of your dagger,
if the blow light near the point it may glance over, and so hit you on the
head, and also by reason of the shortness of your dagger which are now most
commonly worn of all men, for I have known men of good skill deceived by
trusting to the point, or dagger only for the defense of a blow, the dagger is
not sure to defend it.

For look how much you step wide you loose so much ground forwards.
But when you make any play to your enemy whether it be offer, or an answer,
stop, right as a line forwards from your left foot, for if you stop half a
foot wide with the forefoote of the straight arm as it were by rule, then you
loose half a foot of your space betwixt you and your enemy, and if you step
likewise a foot wide, then you loose likewise a foot of advantage. For your
instruction herein, when you practice in a chamber, look what board you stand
upon, you should in delivering either of blow or thrust, always steps forth
with your right foot upon the same board which the left foot stands on, for
look how much you left your fore foot wide of the straight line toward your
enemy, you loose so much in your reach forward, as in your practice you may
see the trial and used often in practice in some Chambers with your friend
until you are perfect, and in your practice, keep your left foot fast
moared, that as an Anchor pulls home the ship, so the left foot must pluck
home the right foot and body into the right place of distance again, or as
the helm guides the ship, even so the left foot must guide the body,
always bearing thy full belly toward thy enemy, I mean the one shoulder so
near as the other, for if thou wreathe thy body in turning the one side near
to thy enemy then the other, thou do not stand in thy strength, nor so
ready to perform an answer, as when thy whole body lies toward thy enemy.

The manners of a passage.
A Passage is to be made advisedly with a nimble actiuitie and celerity of
the body, for he which will go in with a passage and escape, or go clear
away with all, the which is very hardly to be done if thy enemy be
skillful, and therefore in the performance thereof, thou must have great skill,
much practice and good judgment, especially in observing the point of thy
enemies weapon, and likewise thou must not consume one jot of time in thy
performance, for so soon as thou see thy enemy bear his point steadie in
any guarde, whether it be high or low, as if he do bear his point a loft,
then step in with thy left foot with a sudden iumpe, and clap thy Dagger under
his Rapier crosse-waies, and so bearing up his point over thy head, and at the
very same instant that thou ioynest with his Rapier, then chop in with thy
Rapier point withal to offend him, but thou must consume no time in staying
any space betwixt thy Defense and Offense, for thou must not make two times of
that which may be done at one time, and again, it is thy greater advantage to
do it quickly, if thy enemy do lie in a steadie guard, but if he keep the
point of his Rapier variable, then it is not to be done but with the greatest
danger of all.

The second opportunity to pass upon your enemy you have, if your enemy do
carry the point of his Rapier so low as your girdle stead, or there-abouts,
then you must step in with your left foot, and with your dagger strike away
the point of his Rapier, and with the same let your Rapier pass unto his
body, as beforesaid, I mean both at one time.

The third advantage is if your enemy do lay the point of his Rapier near,
or upon the ground, then step in with thy hindermost foot and cross your
Dagger overthwart his Rapier, keeping his Rapier down, so that he cannot
raise his point before that you have hit him, and are recovered to your
distance again.

The fourth way is you being both in your guard according to the first
picture, or any other guard according to your practice, and then feign a
thrust down to his knee, but presently raise your point again with a iumpe
four foot side-waies toward the left side of your enemy, and mount up your
Rapier hand withal, and put in your thrust over your enemies Dagger, into his
Dagger shoulder, and so with all possible speed recover your guard and
distance again, by springing or iumping toward the left hand of your enemy,
and so you fall away from danger of his point: but in falling back again,
your Dagger must be prepared to defend a second, or a parting thrust, if your
enemy should charge you therwithall immediately.

Yet there is another kind of passage, and that is an answer upon your enemies
proffer, if your enemy do offer a thrust at you, defend it with turning
downward the point of your Dagger, and at the very same instant slip in with
your left foot, and put in your thrust into his body, for by stepping in with
the left foot it goes in so strongly, that it is hardly to be prevented.

Some that are ignorant will say that it is not possible to defend a passage,
but I say there is no devise to hit a man neither with thrust nor blow, but
there is a true defense to be shown by one that is skillful, but yet not every
one that professes himself to be a Fencer cannot teach true defense, but it
must be such as have been grounded in the true art of Defense by great
practice, such a one it must be to teach defense.

The danger of a passage is to be presented three ways.
THe first is by an active and nimble shift of the body by falling back with
the right foot, and the danger being past to charge hastily upon your enemy
again, but the best way is in lying in your guard according to the first
picture, as your euemie comes in with his pass suddenly upon the first
motion, fall your point, and in the very same time put him out withal, and
with your Dagger only defend his passage, if it be charged at your body, by
turning the point downward, but if he put it into your Dagger shoulder in
manner of an Imbrokata, then you must not let fall your Dagger, except you
leave your Rapier to be a watchman for the defense of your sholder or with
bearing them both together it may be defense.

Another defense of a passage.
THe single Rapier alone, being carried according unto the rule of the single
Rapier, as hereafter shall be described when I come to that weapon, now if your
enemy do take the point of your Rapier, the which he may very well do by
reason of the high carriage of him, if you be not careful to fall your point
when you see him coming in, well if he do make seizure of your point, yet
he cannot stay your Rapier hand, but that you shall have two foot of your
Rapier and the hilts at your command for the defense of your body, which by
swearuing or beating him over your body, toward your left side, and a little
turning your body by falling back with your foremost foot, this is a good
defense for a passage: but indeed a man must have practice, and be as we call
them a good scholar, that is such as be skillful; for a passage comes with
such celerity, that one which is not used to it, cannot deserve the coming of
it, for there is no thrust so swift, nor so dangerous as the passage, but yet
there is no thrust, nor blow nor passage, but by skill and cunning it is to be
defended and avoided, for a man shall deserve the coming of a passage so
plain as a Hawke, when she intends to fly at Check, sitting upon the
Perch, a man may very easily perceive by the settling of her self to fly,
indeed it is dangerous and deadly, except your mind be upon your business,
for when you are at your play, you must expect a passage and false play as well
as true play, or plain thrusts, for the hurt of the passage is most dangerous
of all and most mortal, for with a passage a man cannot say I will hurt my
enemy but a little, as you may with any other thrust, being put in at the
length, I mean observing a true distance, for he that otherwise breaks
distance may be as soon hit himself, as he hit another; therefore the passage
is seldom or never used in fight, although they be both never so skillful in
putting forth a passage, or if one can pass, and the other cannot, but he
that can pass will be doubtful left, the other will entrap him in his own
assault, for why may not thy enemy be as skillful as thy self, once if he
meet thee in the field, he shows himself valorous therein, and if it be
thy fortune to hurt him by want of skill in a manner amongst men, he is
reported to be as good a man as thy self, in regard he adventured himself
with that small skill he had, and then in respect of an honest mind, ought
o show him some favor, if he be not too forward, whereby he is like to
endanger thee, but yet rather hurt, then be hurt, and rather kill, then be
killed, if there be no remedy.

False play at Rapier and Dagger.
YOu must proffer, or feign a thrust a foot above your enemies head, but
presently pluck back your hand again, and put home your thrust which you
mean to hurt your enemy withal under his Dagger arm, either unto his body
or thigh, as you will your self, but step not forth with your foot when you
feign a thrust, but with the second thrust which you mean to speed your enemy
withal, let then your foot and hand go together, for in faining it over his
head, it will seem to him that you mean to hit him in the face, so that
suddenly he will lift up his Dagger, thinking to save his face, but he cannot
put him down so quickly again but that you may hit him as aforesaid: again
if you profer or feign a thrust to your enemies knee, I mean more quick then
I can speak it, thrust it into his Dagger sholder, or to his face whether you
list, for you shall find them both unguarded, for when he puts down his
Dagger to defend the fained thrust, he cannot lift him up again before you
have hit him as beforesaid, if his Dagger arm were never so strong, nor never
so ready, he must put down his Dagger and so he will, or else you may hit
him in the breast, for no man can tell whether the fained thrust will come home
or not, but he which does thrust it, if the defense were never so skillful,
but now the only way to defend a false thrust, is with the single Rapier, for
when that the Dagger falls to clear the fained thrust from the body, then
the Rapier must save the upper part, I mean the face and shoulder, by bearing
him over your body as you do at the single Rapier, and so by that means the
Rapier will defend all the body so low as your knee. By false play a Rapier
and Dagger may encounter against a Sword and Buckler, so that the Rapier man be
provident and careful of making of his assault, that he thrust not his Rapier
into the others Buckler: but the false play to deceive the Buckler, is by
offering a fained thrust at the face of him that has the Buckler, and then
presently put it home to his knee or thigh, as you see occasion; for he will
put up his Buckler to save his face, but can not put him down again before
you have hit him, as aforesaid.

Likewise you may proffer or feign a thrust to the knee of the Buckler man, and
put it home to his buckler shoulder, or face; for if he let fall his Buckler
to save below, he can not put him up time enough to defend the upper parts of
his body with his Buckler, but must trust for his defense, to his single Sword:
wherefore it behooves every man to be skillful in the Backe-sword. The best
way to make a false thrust, is to strike it down by the outside of your
enemies Rapier hand, but not to thrust it home, and so presently bring up the
point of your Rapier, and thrust it home to his left shoulder; for if you
thrust the fained thrust within the compass of his Dagger, then it may be he
will hit the point of your Rapier, in offering to break the fained thrust; and
if he do but touch your Rapier in your first proffer, then you cannot recover
your point to put home your second thrust, before he has recovered his guard,
and so will prevent you: therefore, if you do make a false thrust, present it
without the circle or compass of his Dagger, that in his defense he may miss
the hitting of your point, then has he but the single Rapier to defend your
second thrust, and he must make his preparation first before hand with his
Rapier, if such an occasion be offered, otherwise it cannot be defended.

Now there be diverse other guards to be used at the Rapier and Dagger, but most
of them will ask a great deal more practice, to be perfect in, then this first
guard, and yet not any one of them more severe for defense both of blow and
thrust then this first guarde is, and therefore I do account it the master
guard of all other, yet in a School, to make change of your play, then the
more guard the more commendable, so they be performed with discretion and
judgment: therefore I have described those which I think necessary, although
not so at large, as hereafter you shall have them in a second book; for at
some times, and for some purposes, one guard may better serve then another: for
change of guards may cross some men's play, whereas if you use but one guard,
may in often play be worn threed-bare, therefore learn as many fashions of
lying with thy weapons as thou can, and then in thy often practice make
trial which thou do fit best withal, and that repose thy self upon at thy
most need: for I have known many that could well defend themselves at one
guard better then at another, although he be a cunning teacher, yet he cannot
make all his Scholars frame themselves unto true defense, all using one guard,
wherefore there must be trial made; for if the Scholar be dull of conceit in
one guard, yet it may be he will fit better unto another, so those which I have
found by my trial and practice, to be guards of defense, I put them down
briefly as follows, but I think it were as good left them undone, as begun
and not end them, yet thou shall have a taste, for by a taste men shall see
what wine is in the Butte.

The cross guard.
CArry the point of your Dagger upright, and the hilt so low as your
girdle-stead, without putting your thumb against the blade of your Dagger, but
griping him fast in your hand, and the point of your Rapier under your Dagger
hand according to the picture.

Lying thus in your guard, your belly or breast will seem to be open or
unguarded, so that he will make no doubt but to speed you in his first
assault; but he charging you with a thrust, for your defense, if it be above
the girdle-stead, then carry your Dagger steady over your body, keeping the
point upright and bear him toward your right side, but in your defense, do
not turn the point of your Dagger downwards, but presently bring him into his
right place again, and then upon his offer or making of play, if he charge you
above the gerdle-stead, then defend it with the Dagger, and presently step in
with your left foot, and thrust withal unto what part of his body you list;
but if he charge you under the gerdle-stead, then defend it with your Rapier,
striking it downward; now you must make your self ready to take your time of
advantage in your answering: I mean in the very motion of your enemies
assault, defend and offend both with one time: if you both lie upon this guard,
looking who shall make play first, then make you a short thrust, but presently
clap into your guard again, and so you shall draw him to make play, and yet be
firm and ready in your guard to take your greater advantage, which must be
done upon your enemies charge; for when he has charged you with his thrust,
and you defended your self, as before-saide, then step in with your left
foot to answer his assault, presently upon your defense. Now if your enemy
lying in this guard, and will not make play, then the best advantage which you
have of your enemy, is charging him (in a manner) as it were with a wrist or a
dropping blow to his face, breast, or knee, putting it in slope wise, by
turning your knuckles inward, and when it is lighted on the place which you
determine to hit; then thrust it home withal, and this thrust being put in
slope wise, is the best thrust to hit him which lies in the cross guard, and
the defender must be ready and nimble with his Dagger for his defense; or
otherwise to be prevented: but for a stroke, or a fore-right plain thrust, it
is with more ease defended by him which has the perfectness of this guard,
then it is by lying in any other guard.

Now if your enemy do lie on this cross guard, you may proffer a fained
thrust at his breast, and presently put it into his Dagger shoulder on the
outside of his dagger arm: this false thrust may be defended with a quick
bringing back of the Dagger again: but then the defender must not over carry
his dagger to defend the false thrust, yet he must carry him against every
offer.

Another defense belonging to this guard is lying in this cross guard, if your
enemy charge you under the gerdle-stead with a thrust, strike it by with your
Rapier, by letting fall your Rapier point toward the ground; but if it come
above, then defend it with your Dagger, as before, but do not carry your Dagger
above half a foot; for if you ouer-carry your Dagger, you may be endangered
by the false play. Again, if you make the first proffer, and your enemy lying
in this guard, then, so soon as you have made your thrust at him, presently
let fall the point of your Rapier to the ground-ward, lifting up your Rapier
hand, and defend his answer with your Rapier, by striking it outward, I mean
toward your right hand, so that his thrust may go clear on your right side,
for your Dagger will not defend your enemies answer so well as your Rapier,
especially upon this guard.

Many have had a good opinion of the stokata guard, but (in my mind) it is more
wearisome unto the body, and not so defensive for the body, as the first guard
following the first Picture; my reasons are these, the hilt and rapier hand
being borne so far back behind the body, it cannot defend a blow, for the
blow will light before you can bear out your rapier to bear the blow back
sword-way, as it should be done, neither can the Rapier defend a false thrust,
and a false thrust must be defended with the Rapier only: Also the point of
the Rapier being borne so low as this guard restrains them, the face and
breast lies open, or else unto a single defense which is not sure; therefore
keep two strings to thy bow, it is safe riding at two anchors a head, but if
a man were put to an extreamitie, then it were better to have half a loaf
then no bread, better to defend it single, then to take it on the skin, and
so I will with words describe this guard, and some other.

The Stokata guard.
YOu must (if you will frame your self into this guard) keep the Dagger point
outright, and so hie as your cheek, and your Rapier hand so far back, and
something low as you can, and your feet three foot distance at the least, and
this guard many Professors do teach as the chief and master guard of all
other; Now the reasons which they show to draw men into this guard, is first
say they, the head bowing back, then the face is furthest from danger of a
thrust or blow: now to answer this again, I say, that although the face be
something further from the enemy, yet the bottom of the belly, and the fore
leg is in such danger, that it cannot be defended from one that is skillful;
and to be hurt in the belly is more dangerous then the face, whereas if thou
frame thy guard according unto my direction following the first Picture, then
shall thou find that thy belly is two foot (at the least) further from
danger of a thrust, and so is the foot likewise, and the leg safe and out of
danger both of blow and thrust: and now thy face will seem to be, and is the
nearest part toward wards thine enemy, but then thou have thy dagger being in
his right place, nearest unto thy face, ready to defend him: again, he which
stands abroad with his feet, will always be in jealousy of his fore leg,
the which must be defended by plucking him up nimbly at every blow and
thrust, and yet that will not surely defend him from a thrust, but admit you do
defend the leg by plucking him up, then do you loose your time of answering
your enemy, which should be done in the same time which you pluck up your
leg, and before you can come in again with your answer, your enemy will have
recovered his guard and distance again: There are many other guards, some of
them I will touch a little, and some of them I will leave until an other time:
there are three high guardes, one of them I will speak next of, because it is
a great enemy, not only unto the Stokata guarde, but it likewise crosses
all other guards, and it follows in this manner.

Keep your thumb long ways upon the blade of your Rapier, according unto the
natural Art; the common holding of the vulgar sort, and your feet so close
together, as you can, and the hilt of your Rapier so hie as your cheek, bowing
the elboweioynt of your Rapier arm, and your Dagger hilt so low as your
gerdle stead, and bear the point of your Dagger upright, and the Rapier point
on the in side of your Dagger, both close together, looking under your Rapier,
and bear out your Dagger at the arms end, without bowing your elbow joint;
and if your enemy charge you with a thrust, carry the thrust with your Dagger
toward the right side, keeping the point of your Dagger upright, not turning
him in your defense this way nor that way, but bear him steady over your body,
and so you may defend any manner of thrust: for if you bear your dagger (as
aforesaid) your enemies point will pass clear under your Rapier arm, but
having once defended, in the very same motion you must lift up the hilt of your
Rapier, and turning your knuckle upward, and withal, turn your point down
into your enemies rapier shoulder, stepping forth with the right foot and
hand together, your defense and offense must be all done with done motion. Now
if your enemy charge you with a blow, you are as ready to defend it double on
this guard as in any other: but if thou charge thine enemy, or make the first
assfault, prepare thy defense for the Rapier shoulder, by carrying thy Dagger
over thy body, keeping the point of thy Dagger upright. This defense is good
to be used against a left handed man likewise.

Now he which is well experimented in this guard he will find it very
dangerous for offense to thine enemy, and defensive for thy self, above all
other guardes, especially if thou have discretion to lie at watch discreetely,
and to take thine opportunity and advantage, when thine enemy proffereth any
kind of play upon thee.

The careless or the lazy guard.
LAy the point of your Rapier upon the ground a foot wide of your left side
overthwart your body, and let the hilt of your rapier rest upon your right
thigh, and your dagger under your rapier about a foot forward of the hilt, and
so leaving your whole belly or breast, will seem a very fair bait for your
enemy to thrust at, but when he charge you with a thrust, your defense must
be by the lifting up of your Rapier point, with your Dagger, throwing him over
toward your right side, but lift not up your Rapier hand in the time of your
defense in any case, for so it may endanger the face, but so soon as you have
turned it clear over your body with both your weapons as aforesaid (it may
be done with one of them, but not so well because not so sure as with both
together) then upon your defense recover your point hastily again and chop him
in with an ouer-hand thrust, turning your knuckles upwards into his right
shoulder where you may easily hit him if you be quick in taking your time
before he recover his distance, or get out of your reach. This is no painful
guard, but very easy and quickly learned, and it is a very sure guard to
defend any manner of thrust, now upon this guard if your enemy do falsefie a
thrust upon you by offering it at breast or face, whereby to make you lift up
your weapons, thinking to hit you beneath with a second thrust by reason of
your lifting them up to save the other parts the which you must do, but
failing of it above, bring down your Dagger quickly again to defend below the
second thrust.

The fore-hand guard at Rapier and Dagger.
PVt thy Rapier hand under the hilt of thy Dagger, always keeping the point of
thy Rapier something variable, and yet something directly about the
girdle-stead of thy enemy, and the point of thy Dagger in a manner upright, or
a very little leaning toward thy left side, and both thy Dagger and thy
Rapier hilts together, and both so low as thy girdle-stead: those being
guarded, if thy enemy do charge thee with a thrust, carry thy Dagger quick
over toward thy right side, and make a present answer by chopping out the
point of thy Rapier, and so hastily into thy guard again, expecting a fresh
charge.

The broad Ward.
Bear out both your arms right out from your body stiff at the arms end,
and a foot at the lest a sunder, and turn both the Rapier and Dagger hilts so
high as your breast or hier, leaving all your body open, or unguarded to seem
to, and when your enemy does charge you with a thrust, strike it with your
Dagger toward your right side, and withal answer him again with an
ouer-hand thrust unto his Dagger shoulder, but you must keep your thumb upon
the blade of your rapier, for then shall you put in your thrust the more
steddier, and the more stronger.

The names of the chiefest thrusts, which are used at Rapier and Dagger, with
the manner how to perform them.
A Right Stock, or Stockata, is to be put in upwards with strength and
quickness of the body, and the guard for the putting in a stoke is leaning so
far back with your face and body as you can, and the hilts of your Rapier
so near the ground, or so low as you can, but of this guard I have spoken
sufficiently already.

A slope Stock is to be made unto your enemies breast, or unto his Rapier
shoulder, if he do look over his Rapier, but in putting it in, you must
wheel about your Rapier hand, toward your left side, turning your knuckles
inward, this thrust being put in slopewise as aforesaid, will hit thy enemy
which lies upon the Crosse-guard, or the Carelesse-guard, or the Broad-ward,
when a right Stock or plain fore right thrust will not hit.

A Imbrokata, is a falsifying thrust, first to proffer it toward the ground,
so low as your enemies knee, and then presently put it home unto your enemies
Dagger-shoulder, or unto any part of his Dagger-arme, for he will put down
his Dagger to defend your fained thrust, but cannot recover his Dagger again
before you have hit him in the Dagger arm, Shoudlers or Face, whether you will
your self, for in proffering this thrust, there is no way to defend the upper
part, the Dagger being once down, but only with single Rapier, and except a
man do expect, it, it cannot be so defended neither.

An other thrust called a Reuerse.
A Reuerse is to be made, when your enemy by gathering in upon you, causes
you to fall back with your right foot, and then your left foot being
foremost, keeping up your dagger to defend, and having once broken your enemies
thrust with your dagger, presently come in again with your right foot, and
hand together, and so put in your reuerse unto what part of his body you
please, for it will come with such force that it is hard to be prevented.

A thrust called a Mountanto.
THe Mountanto is to be put in with a good celeritie of the body and in this
manner, you must frame your guard when you intend to charge your enemy with
this thrust, bear your Rapier hard upon, or so near the ground as you can,
lying very low with your body, bowing your left knee very nere the ground
also, and either upon your enemies thrust or in lying in his guard you may
strike his rapier point toward your right side with your dagger so that it may
pass clear under your rapier arm, and with the same motion as you strike his
rapier, so dainely mount up your Rapier hand higher then your head, turning
your knuckles upward, but turn the point of your Rapier downwards over his
Rapier arm into his breast or shoulder, and you must be quick in the
performance of this thrust, and likewise nimbly you must leap out again. This
thrust must be put in by the stepping forward of your left leg: now if you use
this thrust more then once, your enemy will expect your coming a loft with
him as you did before, but then put it in the second or third time underneath,
and you shall hit him about the girdle stead, and so because at this time I
will not be over tedious I leave to speak of many other thrusts.

The best way for the holding of a Dagger, either to break blow or thrust, and
four ways bad as follows.
FIrst, if you hold your dagger too high, you may be hit under the Dagger-arme.

Secondly, and if to low, you may be hit over the Dagger-arme, either in the
arm, shoulder or face.

Thirdly, and if you bear your dagger too much toward your rapier-shoulder,
then you may be hurt on the outside of the arm by bearing narrow, for so we
call the carriage of him, being borne in this manner before spoken of.

Fourthly, if to wide from your body you may be hurt on the inside of the
arm, face or breast: if the dagger-elboe joint be crooked, then there is
small force in the dagger-arme for the defense of blow, or thrust, but the
dagger being borne out stiff at the arms end, defends a blow strongly, as
you shall hear by and by.

Four ways naught to break a thrust.
FIrst, if you break a thrust downe-wards, it may hit you in the bottom of the
belly.

Secondly, if you break him upwards it may endanger you in the face.

Thirdly, and if you break your enemies thrust toward your Rapier-side, it
may hit you in the Rapier-arme.

Fourthly, or in breaking a thrust, if you let the weight of your Dagger carry
your Dagger-arme back behind you, then your enemy may with a double thrust
hit you before you can recover up your Dagger in his place again.

A good way to defend a thrust or blow.
THe best holding of a Dagger is right out at the arms end, and the hilt even
from your left cheek, and the point compassing your body, I mean bowing
toward your Rapier-shoulder, and when you break a thrust, turn but only your
hand-wrist about, letting fall the point of your Dagger downe-ward, but keep
out your Dagger-arme so stiff as you can, so shall you be ready to defend
twenty thrusts one after another, if they come never so thick, and likewise
you are as ready for a blow; whereas if you fall your arm when you break
your thrust, your enemy may hit you with a second thrust before you can
recover your Dagger in his place to defend it, for a thrust goes more swifter
then an arrow shot out of a bow, wherefore a man cannot be too ready, nor too
sure in his guard; Now both for defense and Offense of every blow and thrust,
thou must turn thy knuckles vp-ward, or downe-ward, inward or out-ward,
always turning your hand according to the nature of the guard, that you frame
your self unto, or according as when you see enemies guard, then you must
determine before you charge your enemy either with blow, or thrust, in what
manner to turn your hand in your Offense or Defense, sometimes after one
manner, and sometimes after another, as both before and hereafter shall be
sufficiently fatisfied more at large.

The true guard for the single Rapier.
Keep your Rapier point something sloping toward your left shoulder, and your
Rapier hand so low, as your girdle-stead, or lower, and bear out your Rapier
hand right at the arms end, so far as you can, and keep the point of your
Rapier something leaning outward toward your enemy, keeping your Rapier
always on the outside of your enemies Rapier, but not joining with him, for
you must observe a true distance at all weapons, that is to say, three foot
betwixt the points of your weapons, and twelve foot distance with your fore
foot from your enemies fore foot, you must be careful that you frame your
guard right, now you must not bear the Rapier hand-wide of the right side of
your body, but right forward from your girdle-stead, as beforesaid.



The Reasons of this guard.
IN keeping your point something sloping or compassing your face, your enemy
cannot offend you with a wrist blow, which if you keep your point directly
upright, you may very easily be hit in the face.

Being guarded as beforesaid, if your enemy discharge a thrust at you, carry
your Rapier hand over your body toward you left side, keeping your point
directly in his place until you have defended your enemy assault, then
presently after let fall the point of your Rapier, turning your knuckles
inwards, and discharge your thrust at your enemies thigh, or body, as you see
occasion.

There are likewise many other guards to be framed at single Rapier, as that
one of the short Sword is a good guard at some times, and for some purposes, if
a man be perfect in it, by skill and practice aforehand, as hereafter you
shall see the manner thereof more at large, when I come to that weapon.

Now another fashion is, by holding your left hand upon the blade, and so with
the strength of your forefinger and thumb of your left hand, you may break
your enemies thrust clear off your body, by turning of your rapier point
downe-ward or vp-ward accordingly, as your enemy charge you; and then charge
your enemy again with a quick answer.

Now another is, by standing upon the stock, ready to choppe in upon your
enemies assault, but you must turn in your left shoulder to your enemy nearer
then the right, only to be as it were a bait unto him, but when he does
thrust at you, wheel about your body, falling back with your left foot; but
withal, thrust out your rapier, and so you may hit, and defend, only with
the shift of the body, and you shall find that the oppressor will come upon
his own death, by proffering at that shoulder, which you make show to be open
unto him: but you must not offer to defend it with your rapier, but only trust
unto the shift of your body.

False play at the single Rapier.
IF your enemy do lie in this guard, according to this Picture, then proffer
or feign a thrust unto his left side, but presently pluck back your hand, and
thrust it home unto his right arm shoulder or face; for he will carry his
rapier over his body, to defend the fained thrust, but can hardly bring him
back again to save your second or determined thrust, except he be very
skillful, active, or nimble: now if he do not bear his Rapier to defend the
fained thrust when you proffer it, then you may hit him with a plain thrust
the second time, if you put it home without falsing it at all.

Another deceit.
LIkewise, you may proffer or feign a thrust two foot wide of your enemy his
right side, and presently thrust it home to his breast, for he will bear his
rapier beyond the compass of true defense, by reason it will seem unto a
cunning player that your intention is to hit him on the out side of the Rapier
arm, so that when he thinks to strike your point from offending his arm, by
that means he will open his body, although he open himself but a little, yet
with your second thrust you may hit him as aforesaid.

The defense of this false play.
YOu must be very careful that you do not ouer-carry your Rapier in the
defense of any manner of thrust, yet you must carry him a little against every
proffer which your enemy does make: for if a man be very skillful, yet is he
not certain when his enemy does charge his point upon him, and proffer a
thrust, whether that thrust will come home, or no: wherefore (as I said) you
must bear your Rapier against every thrust to defend it, but bear him but
half a foot toward the left side, for that will clear the body from danger
of his thrust, and so quick back again in his place, whereby to meet his
weapon on the other side, if he charge you with a second thrust, thinking to
deceive you as aforesaid.

A slip at single Rapier.
NOw if your enemy do charge you with a blow, when as you see the blow
coming, pluck in your Rapier, and let the blow slip, and then answer him
again with a thrust, but be careful to pluck in your rapier to that cheek
which he charge you at, so that if the blow do reach home, you may defend
him according unto the rule of the backsword.

The defense of this slip is to forbear striking at all, but if you do
strike, not to ouer-strike your Sword, but so trike your blow as you may
recover him into his place hastily again; for in sight if you do strike, you
must forbear strong blows, for with a strong blow, you may fall into diverse
hazzards; therefore strike an easy blow, and do it quick, but to thrust, and
not strike at all, it to thy best advantage.

Another slip.
PVt your thumb long ways, or forward upon the handle of your rapier
according unto the natural fashion, and your enemy lying in this guard, join
your Rapier according as the Picture, and so soon as you have joined, turn
the heel of your hand upward, and your point downward, and so bring you
point, compassing under your enemies right elbow; and then with the strength of
the thumb turn it into his breast: the like you may do if your enemy offer
to close with you at single rapier, for if be come hastily upon you, you can
not draw out your point whereby to offend him, but by turning it in as
before-said, you may hit the skilfullest man that is in his coming in: Now, if
he do defend your point below, you may by a sudden turning up your point,
thrust it home to his right shoulder or face, whether you will your self.

The defense of this slip.
IF your enemy do join his weapon with yours, to close or to turn in a
slip, then make your self ready quickly, by putting your thumb upon your
rapier, as aforesaid, when he falls his point toward his left hand, to fetch
the compass of your rapier arm; then fall your point the contrary way, I
mean toward your left hand, so shall you meet with his weapon below again,
and this will defend your self; and when he raises his point again, then do
you raise yours likewise into his place again.

Another Slip.
IF your enemy do join his rapier with yours, and do bear him strongly
against you, thinking to ouer-beare you by strength of arm, then so soon as
he begins to charge you strongly, bear your rapier a little against him,
and then suddenly let fall your point so low, as your gerdle-steed, and thrust
it home withal, and so you may hit him, for by letting his Rapier go away
suddenly, he swayeth away beyond the compass of defense, so that you may hit
him, and fall away again before he can recover his Rapier to endanger you.

A dazeling thrust at single Rapier or Backe-sword.
PRoffer or feign a thrust at the fairest part of your enemies body with lies
most unguarded, and then more quicker then I can speak it, thrust it in one
the other side, and so changing three or four times, and then choppe it home
suddenly, and you shall find his body unguarded, by reason that he will
carry his Rapier or Sword this way or that way, thinking to defend the false
thrust, because he supposes them to be true thrusts: for there is no man so
cunning, that knows if a thrust be proffered within distance, but that it may
hit him, or whether it will be a false thrust, or no, the defender knows not,
and therefore he must prepare his defense against every thrust, that is
proffered.

A close at single Rapier or at Backe-sword.
FIrst, charge your enemy with a thrust aloft with an ouer-hand thrust,
directly at your enemies face, and withal follow it in close, bearing your
your enemies point over your head, by the carrying up of your Rapier hand, and
then may you make seizure on the hilt of your enemies Rapier or Sword, or on
his hand-wrist with your left hand, and then having made seizure of his weapon,
you may then use what execution you will, I mean either blow or thrust, or trip
up his heels.



The guard for the Backe-sword.
Carry your Sword-hilt out at the arms end, and your point leaning or sloping
toward your left shoulder, but not joining with your enemies weapon, as this
Picture seems, but so long as you lie in your guard, let there be three foot
distance betwixt your weapons, but if your enemy do charge you, either with
blow or thrust, carry your Sword over your body against your enemies assault,
and so cross with him according to the Picture, bear also your point stedie
over your body, something sloping toward your left shoulder; I mean the
point must go so far as the hilt, but not turning your point the contrary
way, but carry them both together. I will make it plainer by and by, because
I would have thee to understand it wisely, for having with a true defense
defended your enemies blow or thrust by crossing with him, or by bearing your
weapon against his assault (as before said) the danger being past, then
presently at the same instant, and with one motion turn down the point of
your Sword, turning your knuckles inward, and so thrusting it home to our
enemies thigh, but with all, step forth with your foot and hand together.

But there is a great observation to be had in your practice concerning the
true carriage of your point, for in your defense if you do not carry your
Sword, true, then it is hard to defend either blow or thrust; for if you
carry the hilt of your Sword against either blow or thrust, as do not carry
the point withal level, even as you lay in your gaurd according to the
Picture; then your hand and face is endangered, but bearing the hilt and the
point about a foot over your body toward your left side; and likewise to
bear your Sword stiff out at the arms end, without bowing of your elbow
joint: provided always, that your Sword being in your right hand, you must
look with both your eyes on the inside of your Sword, for then you have but
one kind of defense, so that the point of your Sword be sloping toward the
left shoulder: but otherwise, if you keep the point of your Sword vprigth,
then your enemy has three ways to endanger you, especially, if you carry
your Sword right before the midst of your belly, with the point upright, as
I have known some hold an opinion of that way to be good, but I say, he that
trusts to that guard, may be hit in the head with a sudden wrist-blow, if
his practice were never so good: and likewise both his arms are unguarded, and
to be dangered, either with blow or thrust; but if you guard your self after
my direction, then your enemy has but only the left side of your head, and
your legs open, and they are easy to be defended; the leg, by plucking him
up, the which you must do upon every blow, which your enemy charge you
withal, and with the same defend the head and body, carrying your Sword over
your body toward your left side, the point and hilt both steadie, as I have
before said.

Now although I here speak altogether of a Backe-Sword, it is not so meant,
but the guard is so called: and therefore, whether you are weaponed with a two
edged Sword, or with a Rapier, yet frame your guarde in this manner and form,
as before said.

Another very sure and dangerous guard at the Backe-sword, called the Unicorn
guard, or the fore-hand guard.
Bear the Sword hilt so high as your face, keeping him out at the arms end,
without bowing of your elbow joint, and always keep your point directly upon
your enemies face, and your knuckles of your sword hand upward; but if your
enemy do charge you with a blow to the right side of your head, then turn
but your Sword hilt, and your knuckles outward, still keeping your Sword arm
stiff in his place, turning but only your wrist and your hand: this is a
very dangerous guard to your enemy, being carried with a strong arm, for by
reason that you keep him out at the points end, being so directly in his face,
that he cannot come near you without great danger, either of blow or thrust,
but indeed if your sword be not carried out with a strong arm, then your
enemy may endanger your head by striking of two blows together, the one being
struck at the point of your sword to strick him down and the other to your
head but they must be struck both together very suddenly, or else there is
small danger in them, now if you are wary in watching when he makes his first
blow, suddenly pluck in the point of your sword to you, and so by that slip
his first stroke he will over carry him, so that if you turn an ouer-hand
blow to his head, you may hit him before he can recover his sword to strike
his second blow, or defend himself lying in this long guard, you may slip
every blow that is struck, pluck in your sword even as you see your enemy
stricke and turn it over to the right side of his head.

A Close at back-sword.
LYing in thy guard according unto the picture at single Rapier, and when you
mean to close, lift up the hilt of thy word so high as thy cheek, and charge
thy enemy with a thrust directly at his face, and with the same motion step
in with thy hind most foot, turning the knuckles of thy Swordhand inward, and
so bearing thy enemies point over thy head, and then catch hold on thy enemies
Sword-hilt, or on his hand-wrist with thy left hand, but on his hilt is the
surest to hold, and then you may either trip up his heels, or cut, or thrust
him with your weapon, and in this manner you may close with a Rapier also, if
you can make your party good at the gripe or close, for your enemy in bearing
over his Sword over his body to defend his face from your thrust, he there by
carries away his point, so that he cannot endanger you if you follow it in
close and quick.

False play with the Back-sword.
YOur enemy being in his guard, and lying at watch for advantage, you may
feign a blow at the right-side of his head, and presently with the turning of
your hand-wrist, strike it home to his left-side, which being done quick you
may hit a reasonable good plaier, for he will bear his sword against the
fained blow, and by that means vnguard his left-side but at no hand you must
not let the fained blow touch your enemies sword, but give your sword a sudden
check and so strike it to the contrarie-side, for if your fained blow do join
with your enemies sword, it will stay his sword within the compass of true
defense, so that he will be ready to defend your false blow, but otherwise if
you touch not his sword he will carry him beyond the true compass of
defense, of the second blow, which you determine to hit him withal, so
likewise you may feign your blow at the left-side of your enemies head, but
presently strike it home to the right-side of his head, in manner as aforesaid.

Another false play.
Again, you may join your sword within you enemies sword according unto the
picture, but presently so soon as you have joined, strike it down to his
leg, but nimbly recover your sword in his place again falling a little
away withal, for so soon as you have discharged your blow, you may very
easily before he can endanger you recover your guard and distance: likewise
you may give a back-blow unto the right side of his head, and presently
withal, fall down again with another blow unto the inside of his leg,
stepping home with your second blow, for when you have made your first blow as
aforesaid, it may be your enemy will wink, and so you may hit his leg
before his eyes open again, so that you do it quick, but if he do not wink,
yet a good plaier will think that when he has defended your first blow a
loft, he will not expect a blow so suddenly as this ought to be struck, and
therefore may be hit with a second blow, yea although he look well to
himself, and the rather that many does not allow in there teaching a
back-sword blow to be stricken at the leg, but I say a man may give a square,
or fore-hand blow to the inside of his enemies leg, and yet very well
recover up your sword again before your enemy can endanger you.

Another deceit.
STanding in your guard, and your enemy charging you with a blow, pluck in
your sword suddenly, and let his blow slip, and so soon as his blow is
past, answer him again, either with blow or thrust whether you will, but if
it be at blunt with a blow, put in right with a thrust, or by plucking in your
sword, and always have a care you pluck him in unto that side of the head
which he charge you at, for in so doing, if his weapons point do reach home,
yet you are at a guard of defense, but with this skill and a little withdrawing
your body with all, his weapon will pass clear, for the force of his blow
will ouerswaie his weapon, and he will so over carry his body, that in a
manner his back will be toward you, so that with a quick answer you may but
him at your pleasure or close with him if you think you can make your party
good at the gripe: likewise you may cloose upon the cross, by joining weapon
to weapon, but when you have made your cloose in your first encounter, take
hold on your enemies hand-wrist, or else on the hilt of your enemies weapon,
for then he cannot well offend you being but single weaponed. But to try your
manhood, at the length of your weapon, I hold it the best fight and less
danger to both, for there is no more certain defense in a close, then is in a
passage, for they are both very dangerous.

Another deceit.
YOur enemy lying in guard, you may strike a back blow unto his right ear,
although it light upon his sword, that is all one, for in striking it above, it
may cause him to wink, or he will think you have don, but so soon as you have
delivered your blow above, then presently, I mean more quicker then I can
speak it, strike it down into the inside of his right-legge, or if you do
but touch his sword in joining him close as the picture stands, and so soon
as you have but touched his Backe-sword on the outside, strike it down unto
the inside of the leg presently, yet always have a care to recover your
sword into his place again for your own defense, the which you may easily
do, yea although you encounter with a very skillful man, but if you strike a
plain blow at the leg without profering it above first, as is beforesaid,
then you endanger your own head, but in presenting it above, you busy him to
defend the first fained blow, so that he cannot be ready prepared to charge
you with any blow of danger before you have recovered your guard, the which
you may well do, although he answer you never so quick.

An other very cunning deceit with the Back-sword.
STrike a blow to the inside of the right leg, or foot of thy enemy, but draw
it to thee, striking it something short, and then presently strike it home
again to the left ear of a right handed man, but it must be done more quicker
then I can speak it, and thou shall find his left ear unguarded, for he will
look for it at the right side, and it were not amiss to strike it once or
twice from the leg to the right ear first, for then he will look for the same
blow again, but yet I would not have you make all your play at the leg, but
sometimes to offer a blow at the one side of the head, and then to the other,
so by making often change of your blow, is the best way to deceive thy enemy.

A very dangerous blow at Back-sword.
THy enemy lying in this guard, soddenly pluck in the pummell of thy sword to
thy breast, and with all turn thy knuckles inward, and the presently proffer
a thrust toward thy enemies breast, but turn it over with a blow to his right
ear, with the which blow thou may hit a good plaier, if he be not aware of
it before hand, for he must bear his sword against the thrust for the defense
thereof, now if he do over carry him never so little further then he ought to
do for his true defense, then he cannot bring him back time enough to defend
the blow before you have hit him, as beforesaid.

This blow is also good for a Left Handed man, or against a Left Handed man.
IF you would hit a Left Handed man with this blow, then present your thrust
full at his face by a sudden lifting up the hilt of your sword so high as your
head, and withal you must now turn your knuckles outward, and so soon as you
have presented your thrust, presently strike it home unto the left side of his
head.

A false thrust to be used in fight at Back-sword.
PRoffer your thrust two or three foot wide of thy enemies left care, and
withal let fall thy point so low as thy enemies girdle-stead or lower, and
then presently with the same motion, raise thy point on the other side of thy
enemies sword, and chop it home unto his right arm, shoulder or face whether
you will your self, for in bearing his sword over his body to defend the
fained thrust, he cannot well recover him back again to defend your second
thrust before you have hit him, as beforesaid, except he has by much practice
been used to that false thrust before hand.

An other dangerous blow.
THy enemy lying in his guard, strike a blow to the inside of his right leg,
and presently with as much speed as possible thou can strike it home unto
his left cheek, for he will bear over his sword to defend the first proffer,
and so withdraw himself into his guard, so that he will be unprovided for the
defense of his left side, if it be struck in with a quick hand. All manner of
false blows, slips and thrusts at what weapon soever, are to be avoided and
defended with the true carriage of thy weapon, as at Rapier and Dagger, if a
false thrust be made below, it must be defended with the Dagger below, and with
the Rapier above. And if either blow or thrust be falsified at the Back-sword,
or at Sword and Dagger, thou must bear thy Sword against every proffer, but be
sure thou do not ouer-carrie him, but that thou may be quick back again,
to meet his second blow on the other side, as bringing thy weapon into his
place by practice, thou shall find thy self surely guarded as in some places
in this book thou shall find the defense.

After the false play at every weapon, although I have not set down the
defense of every slip, nor of every fault, which had been very necessary:
for as every lesson on a fiddle has a several tune, even so every guard and
every falsify has a several kind of Offense, and Defense, but here thou
shall find the Defense that belongs unto many of them, and the rest I left
out for want of leisure to write them, but they shall follow in the next
Impression.

The true guard for the Staff, which we will call the Low guard.
Keep the point of your Staff right in your enemies face, holding one hand at
the very butt end of the Staff, and the other a foot and a half distant,
looking over your Staff with both your eyes and your feet a foot and a half
distance, or thereabouts, according to this picture, always standing cross
with your enemy, I mean, if his right hand and foot be foremost, let yours
be so likewise, and if his left hand and foot be foremost, then make you your
change and cross with him also.



Now, if your enemy do charge you, either with blow or thrust, you lying in
the guard, as above showed, then your defense is thus: and if he charge you
above the gerdle-steade, either with blow or thrust, strike your self against
it, keeping up the point of your staff, so high as your head; but so soon as
you have defended, whether it be blow or thrust, presently answer your enemy
again with a thrust, and then hastily recover your guard again, and in giving
of a thrust, you may let go your fore-hand from off your Staff, but hold the
butte end fast in one hand: and so soon as you have discharged your thrust,
pluck back your Staff, and clap both your hands on him again, and recover
your guard; but yet stay not long, to see whether your enemy will begin with
you, but begin with him first, with a false thrust, as anon you shall see the
manner how to do it: and when you can do it, what need you to stand long
about that which may be done presently, and without danger?

Now if he proffer either blow or thrust unto your lower parts under your
gerdle-stead, if it be a thrust, strike it away, by turning the point of your
Staff toward the ground, but be sure to strike it with that large compass,
that the point of your Staff may pitch, not in the ground, for so you may
deceive your self in your defense, if he charge you so low with a blow, then
you may strike it as you do a thrust, or you may pitch the point of your staff
into the ground two or three foot wide of that side which he charge you at,
and you may in the pitching down of your Staff, let go your sore-hand, that
he do not hit him, and then all parts is defended so high as your head, so
that you always have a care to keep your staff in his right place, that is
to say, if your right hand and foot be foremost, then leave all your body
open, so that your enemy can not endanger you on the outside of your staff,
but if he will hit you, he must needs strike or thrust on the inside of your
staff, and then you must defend all blows or thrusts, by bearing your staff
over your body toward the left side, for this we call the Fore hand Defense,
and this defense consumes no time: but if in holding your staff in the right
hand, as before is said; and yet for your guarde do bear your Staff over
toward the left hand, then you leave your right shoulder arm or face, open or
unguarded, the which must be defended backward, but you may defend twenty
thrusts or blows before hand, better then one backward; for the back defense
is nothing so ready, nor so certain, as the fore-hand defense is, and
therefore keep and continue your guard, according unto the Picture, for then
if he proffer a thrust on the outside of your Staff: you need not to fear
nor offer to defend it, for there is no place in any danger, but all is
guarded, especially from the gerdle-stead upward.

And in your defense, have always a care to the true carriage of your Staff,
that you do not carry him beyond the compass of true defense, for fear of
the false play: for if you ouer-carrie your Staff, I mean further then need
does require, you can not recover him back again quick enough to defend the
false. Now, if your enemy do assault you upon the contrary side, you must
change both your foot and hand to cross with him, as before: but take heed
when you change, you do not come in with your hinder foot, but let him stand
firm and fall back with the fore-most foot upon every change. And having
defended your enemies assault, with a little increasing in, answer him with a
thrust, thrusting out your staff with your hindermost hand, and stepping forth
withal, with your foremost foot, and in the same instant of your proffer, let
go your fore-hand, but after your offense presently recover your hand upon
your staff again: now if your staff be shorter then your enemies, then (for
your better advantage) step in with your hinder foot with your answer, but at
no hand, never strike one blow with your Staff; for he that does but lift up
his Staff to strike, may easily be hit by the defender with a thrust, for in
the same motion that the oppressor does lift up his staff to strike the
defender, may with a speedy thrust hit him in the breast, and hold him off
upon the point of his staff, if the Defender thrust out his staff with his
hinder hand, especially if their staves be both of one length, then he that
strikes, cannot endanger the other with a blow, for he that strikes, holds
both his hands upon his staff, until he has discharged his blow, whereby
he that thrusts, has two foot odds of him in length that strikes, so that
he puts out his staff, to his most advantage, as beforesaid.

It is necessary, that he which uses the Staff, should have use of both his
hands alike, for thereby he may the better shift his staff from hand to hand,
whereby to lie cross always with your enemy, changing your hand and foot,
as he changes for lying the one with the right hand and foot for-most, and
the other with the left, then he that strikes first, can not choose but
endanger the others hand, but if you cannot change your Staff to lie cross
with your enemies Staff: then for your defense of a blow, pitch the point of
your Staff into the ground, and let go your fore-hand, and when you have
discharged the blow with as much speed as you can, answer his blow with a
thrust, for the greatest secret of all most chiefly to be remembered at this
weapon, is, if your enemy do but once offer to lift up his hand to strike,
then presently choppe in with a thrust at his breast, shoulder, or face, for so
you may hit him as you will your self, so that you take your time of answering.

If your enemy strike with his staff, he holds him fast in both his hands
when he delivers his blow, by reason thereof, he which thrusts and loses
his fore-hand, when he discharges his thrust or draws in the fore-hand
close unto the hinder hand which holds the butte end of his Staff, and so
thrust him out withal, you may keep the striker upon the point of your
Staff, so that with his blow he can not reach you, being equally matched in
length, but must come upon his own death, or danger himself greatly.

The high guard for the Staff.
Look under your Staff with both your eyes, with the point hanging
slope-waies downe-wards by your side, bearing out your Staff at the arms end,
higher then your head a little according to this Picture.



In looking under your Staff it will seem to your enemy, that your defense
is only for your head, then he will think to hit you in the body with a
thrust, for the body seems to lie very open unto him, and if he do charge
you with a thrust, carry the point of your Staff over your body close by the
ground toward the other side, and having defended the thrust, turn up the
point of your staff presently toward your enemies breast, and charge him with
a thrust: again, if your enemy charge you with a blow at your head, lift up
the point of your staff and meet the blow half way, and withal, draw back
your hands, for fear of endangering your fingers: having stricken away his
staff, answer him again with a thrust (as beforesaid:) Now if your enemy
charge you with a blow at your side, either pitch the point of your staff into
the ground to defend it, or else change into thy low guard and so cross with
him; if your enemy do strike a full blow at your head, you need not fear
neither of your hands, but by striking with your staff to meet his blow, you
shall defend it upon the middle, or near the point of your staff, although
he do strike purposely at your hand, yet can he not touch your hands not
anyother part of your body: but upon the defense of your body draw back your
hands. Now it behooves you to be perfect, not only in this guard, but also in
changing your staff from hand to hand, according to your enemies lying: to do
well you should change, as he changes, sometimes the point of your staff
should be hanging down by the right side of your body, and sometimes by the
left, according to your enemies lying, the best way to make your change, is to
let your staff slip through your hands, like a Weauers shuttle, for this is
a more speedy change then to shift him after the common manner, and by a
little practice you may grow perfect in it.

The best guard for a dark night at Staff.
IF thou meet with thine enemy in the night, and he charge upon thee, the best
means for thy defense, is presently to chop up into this high guard, except thy
staff be of a sufficient length, to keep him off, with charging the point upon
him, or else the third means is to trust to thy heels, but if thou will trust
to thine hands, then either keep him off with thy point, or else above all
parts, chiefly defend thy head, which is not to be done, but only by this
guard, except a man may see the blow before it do light; now thou must put thy
hands alittle further asunder, then thou do for the day, that the blow may be
defended, by taking him upon thy staff betwixt both thy hands: if it light at
your head, as it is the fashion of most men to strike at the head (as I have
said before) rather then to any part of the body. Now having taken the blow
betwixt your hands, withal, run in and close with him, for if you stand off at
the length in fight, any time, being in the night, it cannot choose but be
very dangerous, if you suffer him to discharge many blows, but either answer
him with a thrust, or else close with him, and turn the butte end of your
staff into his breast or face, as you see occasion: now if it be in the day,
or that you can see the blow before it light; if your enemy charge you with a
blow at the side, meet his blow by carrying over to the other side, and pitch
the point of your staff in the ground, and loose your foremost hand for
dangering of your fingers, but hold the hinder hand fast at the butte end of
your staff. But now, upon this high guard you can not defend the false so well,
nor so sure, as when you lie on the low guard; for if your enemy do proffer a
thrust on the one side your staff, and presently chop it home to the other
side, he may endanger, nay, he may hit a skillful and cunning player,
especially if you ouer-carrie your staff in defense of the fained blow or
thrust.

Wherefore, if you lie on the low guard with your staff or pike, you shall
defend a thrust with the point of your weapon long before it come near you,
and yet your point is ready to answer more speedily then it is when you lie on
any other guard, but he which lies with his point of the staff or pike on
the ground, has very little space to his body, no more then the length of
his arm wherein he holds his weapon: therefore he which suffers a thrust
to come so near, it will quickelie come to the face or body, yet because most
soldiers heretofore have used this fashion of lying, and are not experienced
in the low guard, according to the first Picture of the Staff; but if in your
practice you use both, you shall find the benefit thereof the better; now if
you frame your self into the hie guard, your staff must not be, in length,
above eight foot at the most, but rather shorter, for else in defending your
enemies thrust, a long staff will hit in the ground, and by that means, your
enemies thrust may endanger you: therefore, for this high guard, you must look
that your staff be of that length, that you may carry the point clean from
the ground in defending of a thrust, but for the low guard it is no matter of
what length your staff be.

Questions and answers betwixt the Master and Scholar, concerning the Staff.
The Scholar. You have given me directions for two sorts of guards, which do
you commend best that I may repose my self upon?


The Master. I commend the low guard best, for that it serves with the
Quarter-staffe of seven or eight foot, or for the Long-staffe of twelve foot,
and for the Pike of eighteen foot, for I have made trial with men of good
experience which have lien in other guards according to their practice, as some
at Quarter-staffe will lay their point upon the ground overthwart their body,
holding the butte-end of their Staff so low as their girdle-stead: he that
thus lies the best way to hit him is to proffer, or feign a thrust at his
face, and presently put it home below, for he will carry his Staff up to
save his face, but cannot put him down again before you have hit him
underneath as beforesaid, but with quickness you may hit him in the face or
breast, and never falsify your thrust but put it in suddenly, turning the
heel of hinder hand upward withal: and if your enemy lie at Halfe-staffe,
holding him in the midst, his hands that so lies, are in danger of every
blow that comes, but the best way to hit him that so lies without danger to
thy self, is with a false thrust, and that is to proffer it on the one side of
his staff, and to put it home on the other, according to the direction of the
false play that follows: but first let me make an end of that which I have
begun, and so we will proceed, some will lie with the Long-staffe, or Pike
with the point on the ground, and the butte end so high as his head or higher;
indeed this has been and is common fight with the Pike amongst the soldiers,
and the defense of this guard either for blow or thrust, is to swerue his
vper-hand, this way, or that way, according as he sees the danger of the
oppressors assault, and then presently launch out the Staff or Pike by lifting
them up, upon the outside of their foot or else by gathering him upon their
left arm, and so launch him out as aforesaid: he that uses this guard, must
be strong, and very active, and nimble, but whatsoever he be, high or low,
weak or strong, the low guard is best.


The Scholar. If the low guard be so strong for my defense what need have I to
learn any other?


The Master. It is true, a man can be but sure if he practice all the days of
his life, but it is not amiss for thee to know more then ever thou shall have
occasion to use; for having the perfect use of the low and high guard, you may
close with any Staff man, if you think you can make your party good with him
when you have closed.


The Scholar. I pray you direct me the best manner of closing.


The Master. When you encounter with any man that has a Staff, a Welch-hooke,
or a Halbert, and your self being armed with any one of these weapons, present
a thrust to the face of your enemy, and withal, follow it in with your
hind-most foot also; and as you incroach in, clap up your Staff into the high
guard, and you shall carry your enemies point over your head by that means,
but you must not be slack in following of it in, for he will bear the point
of his weapon so high to defend his face, that he cannot recover his Staff by
no means to endanger you, and when you have made your close, you may turn the
But-end of your Staff in his face if you list, or you may trip up his heels,
if you be cunning in wrestling: but if he have any short weapons about him,
then I wish you to take him about the middle and vn-arme him of it, or else to
hold him fast that he hurt you not, but if you be armed with a Bill or a
Hook, then in your halfe-close you may fall away turning the edge of your Bill
or Hook toward his leg, and so by a drawing blow rake him over the shins,
and keeping up the But-end of the Staff for the defense of your own head, and
so you may fall out of his distance, and recover your guard before he can any
way endanger you.

If your enemy close with you after this manner, and do offer the But-end of
his Staff unto your face or breast, then fall back with your fore foot, and
make a quick change, and you shall have him at great advantage, both for
defense and likewise to turn in the But-end of your Staff unto his face or
breast, and if you list this is a sure defense for such an assault, believe it,
for I know it, he that is perfect in the low guard, may with a Staff encounter
against the Welch-hooke, Holbert, Partizan, or Gleaue, and I hold that a Staff
with a Pike to have odds against any such long weapon, being equally matched
in length, for odds in length with any weapon is very much advantage, where I
wish if any do appoint the field with any of these aforesaid weapons, it is
not amiss for the one of them to condition to bring a hatchet or some other
edged tool into the field to cut the longest staff, except you match them
before hand.


The Scholar. I pray you let me here your reason, for many think that the
hook or any edged weapon has great ods against the Staff.


The Master. Indeed without cunning and skill, the Welch-hooke, and these other
weapons are more fearful unto the ignorant, but he that is cunning in the
false play and slippes, belonging unto the Staff may with a false thrust or
with slipping his blow endanger any other, being weaponed with any other of
these weapons aforesaid. For if you falsify your thrust according to my
direction in the false play, that is, to proffer your thrust on the one side,
and then to put home the second determined thrust unto the other side of his
weapon, and then if your enemy have a Hook, Halbert, or Bill in defending the
false, the head of his weapon will so ouer-carrie him by the reason of the
weight, that he cannot command him nimbly back again, whereby to defend the
false, if your enemy be armed with a Hook, Holbert or Partizan or Gleaue, if
he charge you with a blow, then slip his blow, either by plucking in of your
Staff, keeping of the point upright until his blow be past, and then you may
answer him again, either with blow or thrust, for by slipping a blow, the
weight of the head of any of these aforesaid weapons will go with such a swing
that it will turn his body in a manner round, I mean beyond the compass of
defense.

Again if you think that your face is out of his reach, he which charge you
with a blow with any of these aforesaid weapons, you may let fall the point of
your staff, so that his blow may pass clear over your staff, and so choppe
home a thrust withal under your enemies weapons, and then recover the point of
your Staff up hastily again.


The Scholar. What if I be armed with any of these weapons aforesaid, what
guard will your direct me to frame my self unto?


The Master. I still commend the low guard for any long weapon, whether it be
Staff, Pike, Hook, Halbert, Partizan or Gleaue, my reason is the point being
so high as your head, and the But-end so low as your thigh, then is your weapon
more readier to defend either blow or thrust, if you be charged never so
suddenly, whereas if your point hang downe-wards toward the ground, you can
never lift him up quick again to defend your thrust, but a blow may be
defended easily, for that a blow comes more leasurably, for why it is fetched
with a greater compass, and a thrust goes with far more celerity then a
blow, being put in cunningly, but of these weapons shall follow more at large
in the second book.

Now if thy enemy have odds in length in his Staff, then let thy enemy make
the first assault, and upon defense of his assault step forth with thy
hindermost foot, and so thou shall gain six foot at the least in reach, but
if your staves be both of one length, then upon a charge or answer, increase
in only with thy fore foot, and stand fast with thy hinder foot, only to
pluck back thy body again, and if thou make the first assault, and thy
enemy defend it, and so he make a sudden answer, then it will be hard to
recover up thy staff into his place, to defend it according to the low guard:
but for a sudden shift the best defense is bearing your vpper-hand over your
body, and letting your point fall to the ground, according to the old common
order of the fight with the Pike, at single hand, I mean, hand to hand, or I
may say, man to man.


The Scholar. I pray you how would you direct me to frame my guard with my
staff, if I were to encounter with my enemy, being armed with Sword and
Dagger, or Rapier and Dagger?


The Scholar. I hold the low guard best, charging thy point directly to the
enemies breast, and always have a special regard, that thou poffer nor a
blow, for so he may defend it double on the Back-sword and Dagger, and run
in under the Staff, likewise if thou proffer a thrust, let not thy Staff
loose out of thy fore-hand, but hold him fast, that thereby thou may be the
more ready to charge him again, and again if he encroach in upon thee, for
if thou let go one hand, then may thy enemy very well defend the thrust of a
staff, according as I have directed in the description of the Rapier and
Dagger, concerning the staff, for with that one defense, being experienced in
it, thou may endanger any Staffe-man, that is not wary, and withal, well
experienced in both these weapons, so that thou take thy opportunity upon his
assault, I mean in answering him quick, so soon as you have defended his
assault, whether it be blow or thrust.

Now if thy enemy do strike at the point of thy Staff, thinking to cut him
off, then, as you see his blow coming, let fall the point of your Staff, and
presently chop home a thrust, for in so doing his blow will fly over your
Staff, as by your practice you may be perfect in this slip, for so we call
it. I have known a man with a Sword and Dagger has cut off the end of a
Pike-staffe, but I hold him an ignorant and an unskillful man, that has held
the staff, for though I hold, that a man skillful at the Sword and Dagger may
encounter against a reasonable Staffe-man, the same opinion I hold still, and my
reasons thou shall hear; if extreme need require, and upon a necessity, then
the best means is to be used wherefore to be furnished with the best means
before hand at the time of need, it may greatly stead thee, for every common
man has not knowledge of the best rule, except he have learned it and
practiced it by those which could show it, for it comes not by nature to
none, yet every ignorant dunce, when he is persuaded to go learn skill, will
say, when I am put to my shift I will do the best I can: so a man may, and yet
without skill be killed, although he do his best, my opinion further of this
follows.

Now the best guard with a Sword and Dagger, or Rapier and Dagger against a
Staff, is this, put your Dagger on the inside of your Rapier or Sword, and
join them both together, making your cross with them within a foot or
thereabouts of the hilt of your Rapier or Sword, and looking clear with both
your eyes under them, or betwixt both your weapons, and then if your enemy
charge you with a blow at your head with his Staff, bear them both double
against the blow, and having defended it, turn your point and turn your
knuckles inward of your right hand, and so to go in amain upon him.

But if he charge you with a thrust, then presently let fall the point of your
Rapier downe-ward, and force him down the more stronger, and more quicker with
your Dagger, for to that end I do appoint you to put your Dagger in the
inside of your Rapier or Sword. Lo in this manner you may defend either blow
or thrust of the Staff, yet I must needs confess, there is great odds in
the Staff, if the Staffe-man be very skillful, but otherwise the Rapier and
Dagger has the odds being furnished with skill.


False play to be used at the Staff.
IF you both lie in the low guard, according unto my former direction, then
proffer or feign a thrust unto your enemies face to the fairest side of the
staff, which to your seeming lies most open or unguarded, but the^ presently
in the same motion let fall the point of your staff so low as his girdle-sted,
so that you may pass clear under the But end of his staff; for if with any
part of his staff he touch or entangle your staff, then you can not put in
your false so directly as you should, or as you may, if you pass clear with
your first offer, then may you bring up your point on the other side of his
staff, and thrusting it home, you may hit him in the shoulder or face, as you
will your self, yea although he be very skillful or cunning, so that yon have
the true stroke of it: as to make it plainer, then in offering your false, do
but fall the point of your staff, striking it as it were a blow, but let it
fall two foot wide of that side, which lies open, and then bring it up again
on the other side, and put it in with a thrust, for he will carry his staff
to defend your false, and so by that means open the side which lies well
guarded, and always mark which part of your enemies body lies open or most
discovered unto you, there proffer you your fained thrust, first to the
fairest, but hit him with your second or determined thrust to the contrary
side, and if you feign your thrust to the right side, then thrust it home to
the left, and if you feign your thrust to the left fide, then put it home to
the right, and you may hit him in the breast, shoulder, or face, whether you
list your self, so that you proffer your fained thrust three foot wide of his
body, for if in offering your fained thrust, he hit your staff, it will so
entangle your point, that you cannot recover him to hit him with your
determined thrust, for before you can clear your point, he will be in his
guard of defense again.

The defense of this false thrust.
THis thrust is to be defended two ways, the first is to bear him against
your enemies proffer, but have a care that you do not ouer-beare him, so that
if he mock you with his fained thrust on the one side, you must quickly bring
your staff back again into his place, to meet him when he comes on the
other side of his staff, and so to defend it, keeping your point upright: now
the second defense is to bear your staff over your body against his proffer,
as you do against every ordinary thrust; for you must suppose that every
thrust will come home, for the defender does not know if his enemy do proffer
a thrust, whether it will come home or not: therefore (as I said) you must
bear your staff against every thrust, but you should bear your staff but a
foot out of his place, whether it be against blow or thrust: for if you
ouer-carrie him, you can not recover him to defend neither blow nor thrust, if
it be falsified upon you. Now if your enemy do falsify upon his first
proffer, carry your staff over your body, keeping the point upright against
his first proffer: now upon your offer of defense, at the first you see that
you make no seizure upon his staff, then presently you may perceive he does
but dally with you, only to deceive you with false play, but then your
proffer of defense, both for the true and false play, must be all done with one
motion; for if you see that with the first proffer above he shorten his thrust,
without putting it home, then turn down the point of your staff toward the
ground, and meet him below, and so strike it away, but be sure that you defend
always before hand, for to strike it backward is no sure defense.

Yet to make this fore-hand defense plainer, why then it is thus meant, if your
right hand be placed foremost in holding your staff, then you must defend both
the true play, and the false toward your left hand, but you must not defend
the first proffer forward, and the next, which may be the false thrust,
backe-ward, but both must be defended toward your left side: and so likewise,
if your left hand be foremost, then frame your defense toward your right side,
as before said.

Now if you cannot change hands, as (it may be) your enemy can, then keep
your guard upon that and which you can best use, and you shall find that he
has very little odds after you have practiced it a while; for you may offer
or defend any false play so well as if you lay cross handed one to the other.

A false blow.
NOw, if you would hit your enemy on the head with a blow, you must proffer a
false blow at the head, as if you would strike him down at the first; but when
it is come half way, stay your hand, or check your blow before it meet with
his staff, for he will bear his staff against your blow, thinking to defend
it strongly, before it come to endanger him: but the checking of the first blow
will be an occasion, that he will ouer-carry his staff beyond the compass of
true defense, so that you may presently come with a second blow, and strike it
home over the point of his staff, so by this determined blow, you may hit him
on die head or face.

A Slip at a Staff.
IF your enemy charge you with a blow, you lying in your guard according to
the Picture, even as you see the blow coming, pluck in your staff, and
withal, withdraw your head and body alittle back, bearing your staff,
during the time while the blow has his passage, close upright by that side of
your face which your enemy charge you at, to defend that side, if the blow
do reach home, but if it do pass short, and go clear of you, without
touching your staff, then will his staff fly away with the greater swinge,
so that it will pass beyond compass of true defense; but if it be a
Welch-hooke, or any other head weapon, then will the slipping of his blow be a
more occasion of the ouer-carrying his blow, by carrying his body round, so
that his blow being past, you may presently charge him with a blow at the head,
or thrust him in the back, so that it be done quick before your enemy do
recover his weapons into their place of defense.

Another falsify.
YOu may profer a downright blow at your enemies head, fetching him with a
great compass, so that it may seem to your enemy, that you mean to strike
him down, but as your blow is coming, draw back your hand and change your
blow into a thrust, and chopping home to his breast or any other part of his
body, that you will your self, for he will bear his Staff to defend the
blow, I mean if he be not very skillful and cunning, the which if he do, he
can but defend himself, the which to do he must be very wary when he bears
his staff to defend then the blow, so that he do not ouer-carrie his staff,
and yet to bear him a little and then to check his Staff, and be ready to
turn down the point to defend the thrust, but he that is skillful will, or
should chop out a thrust if his enemy do proffer a blow, and the thrust
should be put out with one hand, and to loose the other, I mean with that hand
which holds the But-end of the Staff, for so thou shall keep him out at the
point of thy Staff; for then the blow cannot endanger thee, except there be
great odds in the length of your staves, for commonly he that strikes,
holds both his hands upon his Staff when he delivers his blow, whereby
there is three foot odds in reach betwixt the striker and he which thrusts.

Another very deceiving false thrust at the Staff.
THy enemy lying in guard, proffer a fained thrust toward his foot, and then
presently raise thy point again, and thrust if home to his face or breast, for
if he turn down the point of his Staff to save the false thrust below, then
if he were never so cunning, or never so strong, yet can he not put up his
Staff time enough to defend his upper part; and therefore not to turn down
the point, if thy enemy do proffer a thrust below is the more surest, but if a
thrust be made below or above the knee, pluck up thy leg, and either thrust
with him, or keep up thy Staff to defend thy upper part, which are the
killing places, rather then to turn him down to defend thy leg or foot,
wherein is not so great danger of death as the body being hit, but at the
Staff all parts may be defended with skill.

The guard for the Sword and Dagger, the which for surenesse we will call the
Castle-guard.


I Might hear in this place discribe many wards or guards, at the Sword and
Dagger, as the Looke-ward, the Iron-ward, the Hanging-ward, the Crosse-ward,
three high guards, the Low-guard, the Broad-ward. I will a little touch them
all, or the most part of them with words, although not with pictures, but in
the next Impression more at large, both with words and with pictures.

But now chiefly at this time I will proceed only with this Castle-guard, or
Back-sword-guard according to the picture, for with the skill of this one guard
thou may safely encounter against any man, which uses any other of the
foresaid guards, for this one guard being perfectly learned thou may defend
thy self with great advantage.

Now for the manner of the framing thy self into this guard, thou must bear
out the hilt of thy sword a foot from thy body, so low as the pocket of thy
hose, and right out from thy thigh, and thy Dagger out right at the arms end,
and thy Dagger hilt even with thy left cheek, but barely looking over the
upper part of thy Dagger hilt, and the points of both thy Sword and Dagger a
little bowing each to the other, and close above, but open thy hilts so broad
below as thou may see clearly thy enemy betwixt them both, as at Rapier and
Dagger before is discribed, for both at Rapier and Dagger, the guards are both
very near alike, but only for the carriage of thy Rapier hand and foot, a
little nearer thy body then at Sword and Dagger, the reasons are, and shall be
made plain unto thee, as in reading thou shall find it, for both at Rapier
and Dagger, and at Sword and Dagger, a man should be prepared as well at the
one, as the other to defend a thrust in fight so well as a blow, and except the
Rapier point be borne some thing high, he is not ready to defend a blow, as by
this guard thus being placed, as aforesaid, thy Sword only being borne out
against the blow, will defend all thy right-side, both thy head, and down to
thy knee, without mooning him, but if thy enemy do charge thee with a blow at
thy left-side, whether he strike to thy head or side, then bear both thy Sword
and thy Dagger over thy body, toward thy left-side, and withal I do advise
thee to have a care to carry both the hilt and point level, even as thou lie
in thy guard, for if thou carry thy hilt of thy Sword over thy body toward thy
left-side, and turn thy point Back-ward, then both at Sword and Dagger, and at
Rapier and Dagger, thy head is endangered, for then thou have but a single ward
for thy head, I mean thy Dagger only, and that is no sure defense for the
head, if thy practice were never so much, but both being borne together,
according unto the Backe-sword rule, thou shall defend both thy head and body
down to thy knee very strongly, and thy leg must save himself by a quick
pulling up of thy foot.

Likewise at Sword and Dagger, you may set your feet a foot distance one
right before the other, Thy weapons thus placed thou shall find thy body gatded
like a prisoner betwixt to keepers, thy sword to guard thy right-side, and thy
dagger the left.
the other which I do not allow of at Rapier and Dagger, also you must keep
the point of your Sword on the inside of your Dagger, and half a foot higher
then your Dagger point, especially if you play at the blunt, but in sight as at
Rapier and Dagger, then you must so exercise your foot, thatyou may pluck him
up nimbly against every blow that comes, otherwise if you do keep them so
near as my direction is at Rapier and Dagger, then is your foot sure without
plucking of him up; bear your head upright, bowing rather to the
right-sholder, then to the left, but not forward at any weapon, but your body
bowing forward, and keep your points close together, and your Sword point on
the inside of your Dagger point (as before-saide) and the hilt of your Dagger
from your left cheek, right at the arms end, without bowing of your elbow
joint, and your Dagger point sloping, or bowing toward your right side,
looking with both your eyes betwixt your weapons, look not over your weapons
with neither of your eyes at any hand; your weapons placed, and your body
settled (as aforesaid) then shall you find no part of your body discovered or
unguarded, but only your left side from the Dagner arm downwards, and that
you must have a care unto, and defend it in this manner.

If your enemy charge you with a blow, defend your self, by bearing the edge
of your Sword against it, and alittle bear your Dagger against the blow also,
only to give allowance for the yielding of your Dagger, if the blow should
chance to light at your head, for your guard simply of himself does defend
but a weak blow; if you stand stock still at your guard as a wrist blow a
drop or a mite, which comes with small force, though they come with more
speed then any other blow, your guard will defend without moving your weapons.
Now other blows which shall come with greater force, consume more time, and
do fetch a greater compass, insomuch as their force is greater, you shall
perceive them the plainer, to which side the blow will come, and if to the
right side, then swerve both wepons against the blow, and if to the left side,
do likewise (keeping up the point of your sword, for that will defend from the
head down to the knee, and the knee and leg which you stand foremost upon, you
must defend by plucking them up, and your sword will defend the hind most
leg, if the blow should chance to reach so far, by taking it near the
hilt, upon the edge of your backe-sword, as aforesaid, for if you put down the
point of your sword to save your leg, then you leave your head and your face
unguarded; for when you see your enemy charge you with a blow, there is no
rule to be shown to know where the blow will light, until it do light: but
this assure your self, the blow must have a lighting place; for when the sword
is up, where he will fall there is no rule to be shown, for when the blow is
charged, it comes so swift and lights where the striker thinks good;
wherefore arm your self to defend every place, whether it comes above or
below; for if you turn down the point of your sword beforehand, thinking the
blow will light at your leg, for so you must do it you will defend him with
your sword, otherwise you cannot be down quick enough, for the blow will
pass more speedier then the turning of a hand; wherefore I wish you to save
your leg by plucking of him up, and open not your head, in hope to save your
leg, and so save neither of them, for the head is the principal place that
your enemy will strike at; therefore keep your points always upright, and in
their place, according to my direction following the first Picture; and
likewise as here I have described it, for it is not enough to know the place
of your weapons, but always to continue them in their place, except it be at
the very instant time of your defense, and offense: but if you make play to
offend your enemy, recover your weapons into your guard speedily again
whether you hit or miss: Now in striking thy blow, let not thy Sword swing
under thine arm by oue-striking thy blow, but wind him up presently into his
place again; alwaie keep the points close, and defend the blow double: for so
doing the point of your sword will be a great strengthening unto your Dagger,
for he that does trust to defend a blow with the Dagger only, may be
deceived, if his cunning were never so good; for if the blow should light nere
the point of your Dagger, by reason of the sharpness and weakness of the
Dagger, it may glide over, and hit him that is skillful, if his cunning were
never so good: likewise, the blow may hit him under the Daggerarme, which
trusts to the Dagger, except he use the defense of his backe-sword, for
which both together a weak man, yea, a boy may defend a strong man with both,
for no man is able to charge a blow with one hand, if his force were never so
great, but one that is very weak and skilful of the Back-sword, may defend
himself double (as aforesaid) for he that charge with one hand, a very
wretch is able to defend with both, having skill and practice in all fashions,
for when one cannot hit thee, yet another whose fashion thou art unacquainted
with may hit thee, but being experienced in many weapons, and in many guards,
and practicing with many men, then if thou have an occasion to answer any one
which thou never saw before, thou will presently call to mind, that he can
but strike and thrust: therefore being prepared before hand, then so soon as
thou see his guard and charge, thou know thy defense.

Now (as I have said before) you must be careful in your defense, and so soon
as you come within the reach of your enemy, prepare your self into your
guard, to defend every part both from blow and thrust, defending the blow
with the Backe-sword so low as your knee, and the point helping to strengthen
the point of your Dagger: then if your enemy charge you with a blow, you must
not prepare to strike with him; for so you may be hurt, and then say afterward,
I thought he would have struck at mine head, and so never reckon upon your
side nor your leg, or if you should think he would have struck at your
leg, and so never regard your head: But I say you must not deal upon
thought, but upon a sure guard, and it is not sufficient, to know your guard of
defense, but you must keep him, for if your enemy have once hit you for want
of keeping your guard, it will be too late for you to remember your defense
afterward, therefore look to it before the blow does light; or if you fight at
Rapier and Dagger, you must look for both blow and thrust, for your enemy may
strike with his Rapier, and hit you if you do not look for a blow, and when
you are hit, it is too late to say, I thought he would not have struck with
his Rapier. Again, at Sword and Dagger, it may be your enemy will thrust, and
you must not say, I thought he would not thrust, for every one will, in a
quarrel, do what his affection leads him best unto, except he alter his
affection by practice.

Here follows the chiefest blows at Sword and Dagger, and the manner how to
perform them.
NOw for thy best advantage, in as plain manner, as by words I can express
them, amongst many other blows, we will here observe these three: the first,
a wrist blow, a half blow, and a quarter blow; every one of these must be
used in their time and place (as this) sometimes with a wrist blow, thou may
speed thine enemy when thou can not hit him with a half blow, nor with a
quarter blow, because there is in the delivering of either of the two last
blows, more time spent, for every blow exceeds each other, in force, and in
quickenesse; this wrist blow will hit thine enemy either head or face, if his
points lie any thing open, or on either side of his head, if he do look over
either of his weapons: for although he do see it coming never so plain, yet
he cannot prevent it, if he had Argus eyes, if his weapons be but an inch too
low, but if your enemy do lie more open, then you may charge him with a
half blow, or a full quarter blow* but the quarter blow serves best for the
leg. If thine enemy do incroach or gather in upon thee, then strike down
to his leg and bear up thy Dagger over thy head, with the point something
sloping toward thy right shoulder, for so thy Dagger will save thy head, and
the point of thy Sword will hit him on the leg in his own coming, and the
upper part of thy Sword will defend thine own leg, if he charge thee in
thine own assault; but so soon as thou have stricken thy blow, recover thy
guard hastily again: the quarter blow does fetch a compass about the head,
that although he come strong, it is not so quick as many other: now there is a
washing blow, which the unskillful do use much, and with that blow thou may
hit thy enemy under the Dagger arm, if he be not skillful, with his
Back-sword, for there is no other defense for it, but the Backe-sword only.

Then there is a whirling blow, and that is after thou have weft thy Sword, or
flourished him over thine head twice or thrice, thou may deliver thy blow,
either to the head or leg, or to what place thou see most for thine
advantage, for it is such an uncertain blow, that he must be a good player
that defends it.

Also there is a back blow which is to be made two ways, the one is a plain
Dunstable way, that is, to fetch thy sword from off thy left shoulder, and so
to strike it to the right side of thy enemies head, or to the outside of his
right leg, but the cunningest way is to bow thy Sword-elbow joint, and with thy
knuckles upward, and thy Sword hilt so high as your ear, and then by turning
of your sword hand wrist, bend, or proffer the point of thy Sword with a blow
toward your enemies Dagger ear, but presently turning your wrist, bringing
the midst of your Sword close over the crown of thy head, and with a
compass blow, striking it home to his Sword ear, or to the outside of his
leg: I cannot with words make this blow so plain as I would, for I would
gladly the ignorant should understand it, for of all the blows of true play,
this is the best, for you may likewise feign it unto the outside of your
enemies head, and strike it home to the other, or unto his side.

Here follows the false play at Sword and Dagger.
IF your enemy be in this guard, as I have here described by false play, you
may cause him to open his guard, but if he lie upon any other guard, then you
need not to falsify, for you may hit him with true play.

If you would hit your enemy on the right side of the head, then strike a blow
to his foot, but strike it somewhat short, then presently bring it with a back
blow to his right ear, the which will be unguarded, by reason of the carrying
his Sword to save his left side, if he be not the better grounded with
experience.

And if you would hit him on the side of his head, then thrust a full thrust at
his belly, turning your knuckles inward, and he will put down his Dagger to
defend it, but then, so soon as you have offered your thrust, presently bring
up your Sword close up by the outside of his Dagger elbow, and with a wrist
blow strike him on the ear or head, keeping your knunckles inward, till the
blow be delivered: with this blow you may hit a good Player, but indeed it is
not a very strong blow. Now to hit thy enemy in the foot, is to thrust two or
three thrusts short at his face, and then fall it down to the leg or the
foot with a blow, for the fear of the daungering of his face with a thrust
will make him forget his leg.

Another way is to strike a back blow strongly to his Sword ear, and
presently fall it down to his foot, for he seeing it come to his head, not
one in twenty, but will wincke, and before he open his eyes again, you may
hit him upon his foot or leg.

But the chiefest blow of all for the leg, is to lift up the heel of your
Sword hand higher then your head, and tip in the point over your enemies Sword,
as though you would hit him in the right eye, but presently bring down your
Sword with a full blow to the inside of his leg, for this blow in offering
aloft loft, will sure make him wink and deceive a skillful man, and if in the
lifting up of your Sword, you say, Beware your foot, it will serve to him,
that you go about to hit him on the head, so he will lift up his weapons to
save the head, but this blow being cunningly delivered comes down to the
leg, with such celeritie and violence, that he cannot prevent it, except he
has been used to it with much practice, but it seldom misseth if it be
cunningly delivered.

Yet there is another deceitful blow for the leg or foot, that is, to
strike a back blow to the sword care (as before-saide) stepping out your foot
with our blow alittle, and see that your blow reach but to his Sword, it is
enough, but hastily pluck back your foot, and your Sword in their place, and
provide to charge him with a blow to the foot, as he comes in to answer
your first blow: now in striking at his leg, be alittle before hand; for as
he makes a motion of lifting up his Sword to charge you, step in with the same
motion, and in falling your point to his leg, you save your own leg, if he
do strike at your leg, then the Dagger must at such a time, defend your head
single, which you may very well do, if you bear him alittle the higher, but
withal, turn the Dagger point down toward the right shoulder.

Also, you may deceive some, with casting your eyes down, and looking to his
foot, and presently strike it home to his head, for with your eye you may
deceive him which is not perfect in this deceit.

Certain reasons why thou may not strike with thy weapon in fight.
THe first danger is described following the first picture in this book, and
in this manner, the defend or is to take the blow double, or on the Back-sword
only, and then presently to charge him again with the point, with the which
the defender may hit the striker in the face, breast or thigh, as he will
himself, the like may be done with a staff, first, defend the blow, and
answer quick with a thrust.

The next danger, if it be with a sword, is this, thou may break or bow him,
or he may slip out of the hilts, any of these dangers may happen at the very
first blow that thou strikest, and if it be a staff it may likewise be broken,
or the pike may fly out, and then thou art not assured whether thy enemy upon
such an occasion will take the advantage upon thee, if such a chance do fall
out, therefore beware of striking.

An other hazard by striking is unto the striker, if his enemy the defender
do but slip his blow by a little withdrawing of his body back, even as he
sees the blow come, and so I say by a little withdrawing the body, and also by
plucking in his weapons, he that strikes the blow will ouer-sway his body
beyond the compass of true defense, and so the blow being past, charge him
presently with a thrust, for he that strikes his blow will carry his body in
a manner round, so that the blow be not defended, but let slip, as aforesaid,
and then you may hit him in the back, either with a blow or thrust, if you
take your opportunity in making a quick answer, as more at large of this
slight I have shown in the false play at each weapon, also diverse reasons here
and there in this book, concerning the disadvantage of a blow.

The Authors opinion concerning th odds betwixt a left handed man, and a
right-banded man.
A Left Handed man being skillful has odds against a right-handed man being
skillful likewise, one reason is a left hand man is always used unto a
right-handed man, but a right-handed man does seldom meet with a left handed
man, for in Schools or such places, where play is, a man may play with forty
men, and not meet with too left handed men, except it be a great chance,
another reason is, when a right-handed man does offer or make play, first unto
the left handed man, then does he endanger the right-side of his head, although
he do bear his Dagger to the right-side, yet it does not defend so strong,
nor so sure, as it does the left, yet unto one that is well instructed with the
true skill of the Back-sword, and other rules which belongs for the best
advantage against a left hand, it will be the less dangerous or troublesome unto
such a one, for he will presently call himself to mind, when he sees that he
is to encounter against a left handed man, he will frame himself presently to
the best guard of defense for that purpose which is the Back-sword, for that is
the chiefest weapon to be grounded in, not only a left hand, but many other
weapons have the true stroke of that weapon, and are guided only by the rules
of the Back-sword, even as the helm guids the ship, now if thou offer play,
first to the left handed man, thou must be careful and heedy to recover up thy
Back sword again, presently into his place so quick as thou can, or else
turn over your Dagger to the right-eare, these very rules likewise must a
left handed man observe to encounter against a right-handed man, yet
furthermore I have known some right-handed men, that were very skillful, and
very ready if it had been to encounter against a right-handed man, but by no
means would not deal with a left handed man, and this was for want of a good
teacher: for the teacher should instruct every one which they do teach by
playing with his left hand with them, for it is an easy matter to have the
odds of both the hands a like with little practice, and then a man may use
which he will, as if a right-handed man were to encounter against a left, and
can use both hands alike, then if he play with his left hand against one that
is left handed by nature, it will seem more cross, and more dangerous unto
him then a left handed man unto a right, the reason is that two left handed men
seldom meet together, now to end with this one speech according to the vulgar
sort, that is an ignorant and a simple man of skill by great and often royling
and moyling of his body, in practicing natural play, I mean only that which
comes into his head, and being right-handed meets with another right-handed
man that is very skillful, and has very artificial play, and yet the
unskillful has plied so fast and let his blows fall so thick, that the
skillful man had enough a do to defend himself, so that the unskillful has
made such good shift, and defended himself contrary unto any man's expectation,
that was so experience and saw it, but there is not one of the common street
plaiers in a hundred that can do the like as I have said before, but not one
in five hundred of them, that can upon the point of a weapon hurt or wrong one
that is skillful or cunning, for many of these street players are so used to
bangs, that they care not for a blow with a blunt cudgel, but most of them are
fearful to deal against a sharp weapon, but now to conclude this, with that
which touches this Chapter, concerning these street players, which have so
well shifted with a cunning player right-handed, the same I say meeting with a
left handed man was not able to defend in a manner one blow in twenty, except
it were in falling back from him, and the cunningest man that is, cannot hit
the vnskilfullest man that is, if the unskillful man do continually keep him
out of his reach or distance, for he which has courage without skill, although
well prepared, yet wants his arms to fight, but of this it is sufficiently
spoken of in the Treatise, in the former part of the Book.

A brief of my principal points which I would have thee keep in continual
remembrance.
NOw to sum up all the chiefest lessons into one sum, and for order sake
we will make four deuisions of them.

The first is to remember to frame thy self into thy guard, before thou come
within thy enemies distance, and so to approach in guarded.

Secondly, remember if thy enemy charge thee with a blow, at what weapon
soever, Be constant and steady in a good guard be slow to make play except thy
enemy do increase upon thee.
yet answer him with a thrust presently, after you have borne the blow double,
according to my direction, following the first picture, but if thy enemy charge
thee with a thrust, then answer him with a thrust at the nearest place, which
lies most unguarded, whether it be his knee or in his making play, your
answer may be to his right arm, shoulder or face, all which you shall find
unguarded in time of his profer, now if he have a close hilted dagger, yet with
a false thrust thou may hit him in the Dagger-arme if he fight not very
warily, or else in the Dagger-hand if he have not a close hilted dagger.

Thirdly, let not fury overcome thy wits, for in a made fury skill is
forgotten, for he which is in drink or over hasty, such a one in his anger
does neither think upon the end of killing, nor fear to be killed.

Now the fourth and last which should have been the first, is to remember to
keep a true distance, and if thy enemy do gather and incroach in upon thee,
charge him with a thrust, although thou put it not home, for a thrust will
fear him, and he which is in his right wits will be loath to come within the
reach, or danger of thy weapon, but if thou suffer thy enemy to come within thy
distance, then if thou had all the guards in the world, and yet stand still
without making play, he will hit thee in spite of thy teeth, wherefore be
doing with him betimes; and he will retreat and fall away from thee for his
own ease, Lo his I wrote, because I would not have thee in an error when thou
should have occasion to use thy weapon, as the best defense, for a shot is
to stand out of the reach of him, even so the best defense of thy body from
hurts and skars is to be proceeded before hand with skill and cunning, and to
remember it when thou have occasion to use it, but if thou want skill, then
keep out of thy enemies reach; now if thou can not remember these four
chief points beforesaid, yet bear in mind these two, the first is to defend
the blow double, keeping both the points upward, and secondly, remember that if
thy enemy do gather in upon thee, thrust to his knee, or whether he do
gather in or no, yet thrust to his knee or thigh, but at any hand steps not so
far forth or thigh, but at any hand steps not so far forth with your thrust
whereby to endanger your face, but if you do step so far forth as you can,
always have a care to defend with your dagger, but if your enemy do set forth
one foot above half a foot distance from the other, then may you hit him in
the thigh or knee, and he cannot reach you so that you do not adventure
further with your thrust, then where his knee did stand when you do offer, for
it may be he will pluck him away, thereby to save him, but that is no defense
for a thrust if it be put in quick: a man may defend the leg from a blow, by
drawing him back, but not from a thrust, but to keep thy feet in the right
place according to my direction following the first picture, and then you are
defended, and ready to offend also.

The Authors opinion concerning the Short Sword and Dagger.
IN describing of this weapon I shall account the time ill spent, yet because
Short swords are in use and worn of many that would leave them off if that
they knew what an idle weapon it were, I mean to encounter against a long
Sword and Dagger, or a long Rapier and Dagger, so small is their Judgment, but
only this, many of them will say it is a better weapon then any of the two
foresaid weapons are, but in my mind they may as well say that chalk is cheese
because they are both white, for I have had much trial and great practice with
the short sword, yet could I never find, nor never will be persuaded but that a
Rapier four foot long or longer, has such great odds, that I never mean to
arm my self with a short against it; for in my mind and by experience I
speak it, there is small skill to be learned with the short sword to encounter
as aforesaid, but only resolution and courage.

He that is valiant and venturous, runs in, breaking distance, if he escape
both in his going in, and in his coming our unhurt; from a man skilful, in my
mind it is as a man would say chance-medly, for if I have the Rapier and
Dagger, I will hazard both games, and set against any man that holds the
short sword to be a better weapon, although that George Giller has most highly
commended the short sword and dagger, yet one Swallow makes not a Summer, nor
two Woodcocks a Winter, if a thousand more were of his opinion, yet without all
doubt there is a great deal more danger then at Rapier and Dagger, for he that
fights with a short sword must adventure in pell mell without fear or wit,
but I have seldom heard or seen any fight with short sword and dagger,
although they be each weaponed alike, but one or both comes home most
grievous wounded: my reason is the distance is so narrow that a man can hardly
observe it, except they have been both practicioners a long time before hand,
for if a man practice continually long sword or long Rapier, yet upon such a
Challenge goes into the field with a short sword, then the danger is greatest
of all: ask Augustine Badger, who speaks highly in praise and commendation of
the short sword, for he has tried that weapon in the field so often, and made
as many tall fraies as any man that ever I heard of or knew since my time, yet
he will say that he never fought in all his life: but was sore and dangerously
hurt.

I have known some besides my self, that have fought with Rapier and Dagger
twenty times, and have never had one drop of blood drawn, and yet were
accounted men of sufficient valor and resolution, those which wear short
swords depend only upon the taking of their enemies point, which is not to be
done if they meet with one that is skillful: I have heard many say in talking
familiarly concerning this weapon, if I take the point of your long Rapier,
then you are gone, but that is not to be done if thou meet with one that is
skillful except thou can take thy enemies point in thy teeth, otherwise thou
can never make seasure upon his point, if he be skillful as aforesaid, but
indeed it is an easy matter for a man skillful to take the point of one that
is altogether unskillful; but rather not answer thy enemy until thou be better
weaponed, there are all these excuses to be framed as in the tenth Chapter of
the treatise, there you may find excuses fit for such as wear short Swords, if
thou like them not I refer to thy own wit to frame an excuse; for some shift
he must have that wears such an idle weapon, for in a word a short sword and
dagger to encounter against a skillful man with rapier and dagger, I hold it a
little better then a tobacco-pipe, or a fox tail, but yet a short sword is
good to encounter against a short sword.

Also a short sword is good to encounter against a naked man, I mean a man
unweaponed, and it is good to serve in the wars on horseback or on foot, yet
a Rapier will do as good service in the wars as a short sword, if a skillful
man have him in hand: we have diverse examples of those which come out of the
field sore wounded, and they will say it was because their enemy had a handful
or a foot ods in length of weapon upon them; wherefore I say one inch is great
ods and enough to kill a man, if they both have skill alike, and do observe a
true distance: yet now you that are as it were married unto short swords,
because some will not give their babble for the Tower of London, although
another do not esteem it worth twopence, yet a man shall as well drive a dog
from a piece of bread, as wrest many from that foolish kind of weapon; again a
sword whether he be long or short, is more wearisome and more troublesome then
a rapier, for a sword will wear out your hose and three pair of hangers,
before a Rapier do wear out one pair; but some do wear their short swords
about their necks in a string, so that if they should have occasion to use
him, he cannot so ready draw out his sword upon a sudden, as he which wears
him upon his thigh, but of this fashion of wearing their swords, I will not
speak much, because I see it is almost left off, for a man may buy a girdle
and hangers for ten groats, which will serve for thy Rapier two or three year,
and a scarf will cost ten shillings, and yet be worn out in a fortnight; but
I will say no more because many give it over for their own ease, I hold a
short sword for to encounter against a rapier very little better then a tobacco
pipe as aforesaid, and so as I began I conclude, yet behold a little help for
him that wears it.

Aguard for the short sword and dagger to encounter against the long Rapier and
Dagger, or else the long sword and Dagger.


Keep your sword hilt so high as your head or higher at the point, hanging
slope-wayes downwards a little wide of your left side, looking under your sword
arm with both your eyes, and withal put out your sword hand as far from your
body as you can, I mean toward your enemy, and your dagger down by your
side, as if you meant not to use him at all, according to this picture. Lying
in this guard your body will seem to your enemy to be very open, insomuch that
he will make no reckoning but to hit you sure with a thrust; the which you must
defend by breaking it toward your right side, and with the same motion step in
with your left leg, which I will call your hinmost leg, for so he should be
until you have made seizure of your enemies weapon: but so soon as seifure is
made consume no time in giving of him leisure to fall back again, whereby to
recover his point again, but forthwith answer him as aforesaid, for having
brought his long Rapier or sword point to pass clear on the right side of
your body, I mean under your right arm, then step in close with your left
foot as aforesaid, and make a cross with your dagger upon his weapon by
clapping in with your dagger upon the midst of thy enemies long rapier or
Sword, keep your Dagger point upright when you go in, and so soon as you
have discharged the assize of your sword, you may presently turn up the point
of your short sword and thrust, or else you may give a stroke with him whether
you will, and to what part of his body you list, and then fall away hastily
again into your guard and distance; know this, that by stepping in with your
hindmost foot, does gain more advantage in ground then you want in length of
weapon.

But at any hand suffer your enemy to make the first assault, because he has
the advantage in length of weapon, and if thy enemy do charge thee with a blow
you may defend it upon this hanging guard, but to turn up the point of your
sword according to backesword rule, and if your enemy charge you with a thrust,
you may after seizure made upon his weapon with your sword as before directed;
you may presently so soon as you are in with the hindmost foot turn up your
sword point and thrust, this offense you may perform without the help of your
dagger, but yet have a care to prepare your dagger in a readiness, lest in
your going in, your enemy do also come in with you, and although you have his
long weapon at your command without any danger, yet may he stab you with his
dagger, except your dagger be in a readiness to defend; for a thrust of a
dagger is as easy to be defended with a dagger, as any thrust is of any other
weapon, but if the defender be overcome with fury, and so thrust both
together, then they both are endangered, but to descend is better then to
offend, and to be offended again upright according to the rule of the
backe-sword, it your defense be upon the hanging guard, then clapping up your
dagger and join with him as it were in commission with your sword, and so
defend the blow upon both together, now if your enemy will not charge nor make
any assault upon you, then I advise you not to gather nor encroach upon him,
except you were equally matched in weapon, for you must observe the distance
which belongs to your enemies long weapon for this guard or any other. For
this guard is but for a sudden shift for those that wear short swords, for
keeping a large distance a man with small skill may defend himself from a
longer weapon, so he seek not hastily by gathering in to offend the other; for
the best defense of a shot is to stand out of his watch; so the best defense
for a short sword man is to observe distance as beforesaid, for he shall find
himself work enough to defend himself, for not one in twenty which fights
with the short sword once will desire to go into the field with such a weapon
again.

Now those that do encounter together with short sword, to short sword, I wish
them to frame their guard according to my former direction at the long sword
and dagger.

If thou frame thy guard according to my former direction as it is here
pictured, then if your enemy does falsify a thrust, and you making account to
defend it with your Sword, as before, and in turning in your left side he
double a thrust, he may endanger you greatly; wherefore it behooves thee not
to ouercarrie thy Sword upon the first offer, but that you may recover him
back into the place again, so that if you have a care if you miss the
striking by of his Sword on the one side because of his falsify, you shall
meet with him on the other, and so defend your self although you cannot answer
whereby to offend him by reason of his falsify, for upon a false if you make
answer, it will be very dangerous to both.

Master. Now my loving scholar I have already described the rules of six
weapons, which I promise to instruct thee in, but yet I have stumbled by chance
upon another weapon, which is as necessary as any of the rest; nay more, for
without thou be perfect in the skill of this weapon, all the rest will rather
be hurtful unto thee then do thee good.


Scholar. I pray you, what weapon is that?


Master. Marry it is a fair tongue.


Scholar. Why do you call the tongue a weapon?


Master. Because at many times, and for many purposes, it is the fittest
weapon, and the most surest for a man's own defense, for the tongue at
sometimes runs so at random, that for want of a bridle like a young colt
overthrows the rider, although it be but a little thing and seldom seen,
yet it is often heard to the utter confusion of many a man, for the tongue is
such a weapon without it be governed, it will cut worse then any sword; a
nettle is a bad weed in a garden, but the tongue will sting worse then a
nettle, and prick deeper then a thorn, likewise many men are taken by the
tongues as birds are taken by the feet, therefore a fair tongue or a tongue
governed well, will better keep and defend thy body from prison, if thou at
any time be committed by the Magistrates when thy Sword will hinder thee if
thou trust unto thy manhood.


Scholar. If I fight with no other weapon, but with a fair tongue, the world
will condemn me, and term me for a coward.


Master. A fair tongue is more necessary for a valorous man, then a good
weapon is for a coward, as thou shall hear: for with a fair tongue thou
may pass through watch and ward, if thou do chance to travel in the night
by occasion, and thou be late from thy lodging, at such a time this is a
principal weapon, and shall more prevail then thy Sword, or any other weapon
whatsoever.

Again, a fair tongue is an excellent weapon, if thou hap in a drunken
company, and there fall to quarrelling; in such a case, if thou draw thy
weapon, it were as if a man should quench a great fire with a bundle of slaxe,
for at such a time, and in such a company, if a man draw his weapon, he may as
soon be killed as kill, for drunkards and mad men are all alike during time
of the drink.

Also a fair tongue is a principal weapon to carry with thee, if thou chance
to travel into any strange country: for if an injury be offered in a place
where thou art not acquainted or unknown, thou may be oppressed with more
then one, for birds of a feather will hold together; and many will hold on the
bigger side, for where the hedge is lowest, the beasts will soonest get over,
but in such a case be well armed with patience for thy Buckler, and a fair
tongue for thy Sword, and thy hand ready on thy hatte to do reverence to
every vassal, although thou be a Gentleman, for the richest man that is, and
the strongest man that ever was, did, and must pocket up an injury in his own
Country, much more it is less disgrace to thee to put up an injury in a
strange place, if an occasion be offered, then rather bestirre thy self with a
fair tongue, then with thy sword; for in such a case thy sword will avail
thee nothing at all.


Scholar. All this while with this weapon you have not taught me how I should
defend my point.


Master. Now I will tell thee, with a fair tongue, thou may save thy money
many times, by promising much, and performing little, especially where little
is deserved, for those which deserve little, a fair promise will pass, in a
manner, as current as thy money: I have known many Musitions many times paid
with fair words: and now that it comes into my mind I will tell thee a tale
(as I have heard it reported:) How King Dyonisius rewarded a crew of Musitions
which came to him with excellent Music, and after the Music was ended, come
again to me to morrow said the King, and I will give you a thousand talents;
the which promise sounded to a sweet and pleasant tune in the Musitions ears:
But in the morning they came, expecting the Kings reward, according to his
promise: But the King looked strangely upon them, and asked them what they
would have, And it like your Highness, said one of the chiefest of them, we
are come for your gracious reward which you promised us. What was that, said
the King? A thousand talents said the Fiddler. Why said the King, Is not that
out of thy head yet? thy Music is quite out of mine, thou pleasedst my ears
with thy music for the present, and I likewise filled thy ears with a pleasant
sound of so much money: to our matter again.

A fair tongue, and kind behauior wins favor, both with God and men,
whereas those which cannot govern their tongues are seldom at quiet: but
always punished or vexed with the Law, and troubles in the Law consume much
money, which with discretion might be kept by government of the tongue.

Now by the hieway, if a careless roister in his own name require thee to
stand, and by virtue of his own warrant does require thy purse; in such a
danger, and in such a case betake thy self to thy weapon, rather then trust to
thy tongue: for to speak fair unto some in such a case will avail thee nothing
at all, but yet for all that, a fair tongue is as a precious balm to bear
about thee although it be not sufficient to heal wounds, yet it may be a
preservative to keep thee without hurts: all the comfort thou can have of
thy dearest friends is but little else the^ bodily sustenance, nay if thy kind
and loving wife which is or should be thy greatst comfort in this life under
God, if she I say do all that ever she can to pleasure thee, yet thou may
hap to find in this book, if thou read it over, one lesson or other which may
stead thee, or do thee more pleasure then all thy other friends: for here are
many things written by me, that peradventure thou may seek after a great
while, and yet not find them elsewhere, and so farewell.


Scholar. Yet stay I pray you, resolve me in two questions more before you go.


Master. What are they?


Scholar. First I would know what odds a tall man of statute has against a
little man's stature, and the odds that a strong man has against a weak man.


Master, Indeed these are questions which I did mean to write of in my next
book, and therefore will but a little touch them at this time, but for my
beginning or proof of this matter the better to encourage little men to take
heart of grace, and not to dismayed by the high looks of a tall man, nor
feared by their great bragges, there is an old saying, goes I never saw, says
the proverb, a little man borrow a, stool to break a tall man's head, and this
proverb runs throughout the world, as the corrant through the Gulf which
our Marrinors do speak of in the way to wards the Indies.

Again, it is not common to fee a tall man valorous and skillful withal, but
generally, little men are valorous although not skillful, now if the tall man
be skillful, the little man must for his advantage, suffer the tall man to
proffer him play first, but then upon the little man's defense presently, with
the same motion step forth with foot and hand, and so by a quick answer
endanger the tall man: now if the tall man be not skillful, whereby to step
forth with his hand and foot together, when he makes play to the little man,
then the little man skillful herein, gets three foot at the least by
answering every assault that the tall man makes by stepping forth with the
foot and hand as beforesaid: but this must be thy help and this must be thy
care, though a little man always suffer the tall man to make play first,
especially if he be skillful, and then be nimble with the answer, stepping it
home with thy foot and hand together, according to my directions, following
the first picture, for what thou want in reach, is gotten by thy coming.

There is another old saying going thus, a tall man is so fair a mark, that a
little man skillful cannot miss him, and a short man is so little and so
nimble, that if he have but a little skill, a tall man cannot hit him for with
his weapons, and a good guard in a manner he will cover all his whole body
with his weapons. Lo this is my opinion, I do not say all other are of my
mind, for there is an old saying goes thus, so many men, so many minds, what
other men's opinions is, I have not to do withal, but this I can say of my
own knowledge, that I have not known one tall man amongst twenty, that has
good skill, nor sufficient valor answerable unto their statures, for tall men
are more fearful then men of a mean stature, for I have seen the trial
both in the wars and in single combat; yet take me not up before I be down,
for I do not here condemn all tall men of personage, for so I should greatly
ouer-shoote my self, and greatly wrong many tall men of stature and valor,
and also of good resolution, but yet all of them are not so, wherefore what I
have said, it is to encourage little men of mean stature, having skill not to
fear any man upon good occasion, those that spend their days without
practicing skill in weapons, so that when they are wronged they fall to wishing:
oh I would to God I had skill in my weapon, for then would I answer the wrong
that such a man, and such a man has done me, but I could wish such unskillful
to live quiet, and not to maintain any quarrel, lest they loose their lives
for want of experience, as many of them have done.


Scholar. Now as you have promised me, I pray you let me hear your opinion
concerning the odds between a strong man of strength, and a little or a weak
man of stature and strength.


Master. Then this briefly is my opinion, a strong man has great odds at the
gripe, or in a close at any blunt weapon, but upon the point of a sharp
weapon, in fight a strong man has small or no odds at all of the little or
weak man, wherefore I would not have a little man be afraid of a tall or
ouergrowne man, no although he were far bigger then a man, for in performance
of any things to be done with weapons, there is no more to be found in the
best of them of great stature upon trial, then is in the ordinary men, or then
is in a little or weak man, nay many times the little or weak man does as
good or better service in the face of the enemy upon the point of the weapon
then the taller man does, for although his stature be small, yet commonly a
little man's heart is big.


Observations for a Scholar or any other.
What length thy weapons should be.

How you should button your foiles for your practice.

An easy way to weapon thy self at time of need.

Let thy Rapier or Sword be four foot at the least, and thy Dagger two foot,
for it is better have the Dagger too long then too short, and rather hard then
soft, for a short dagger may deceive a skillful man his defense, either of blow
or thrust: I have often known a soft dagger cut in twain with a Rapier.

Let thy Staff of practice be seven or eight foot, and better, button both
thy foiles and thy staves before the practice with them, for otherwise the
unskillful may thrust out one another eyes, yea although there was no harm
meant, yet an eye may be lost except the occasion be prevented.

To make your buttons take wool or flocks, and wrappe it round in leather so
big as a Tennis-ball, then make a notch within half an inch of your wooden
foil or staff, but if it be an Iron foil, then let there be an Iron button
riuetted on the point, so broad as two pence, and then take your button being
made as beforesaid, and set it on the end of your Staff or Foil likewise, and
then take leather and draw hard upon it, and bind it with Shoomakers-ends or
parck-thread in the notch, and another leather upon that again, for one
leather may be worn out with a little praclise.

Now if thou have a quarrel and willing to answer, and being not furnished
with a Rapier, then take a cudgel of what length thou will thy self, and make
a shoulder within a handful of the end of it* by cutting him half way
through, and there bind the haft of thy knife, and so the shoulder will keep
him from slipping back, and this is as sure and as fearful, and as good as a
Rapier to encounter against a Rapier and Dagger, or a Sword and Dagger, so that
you have a close hilted Dagger: likewise you may tie a point at the But-end of
the Cudgel, to put in thy finger that thy Cudgel slip not out of thy hand:
this weapon I have made good proof of, but it was in another Country, where I
could get no other weapon to my mind.

CHAP. XII. This Chapter shows the several kind of weapons which are to be
played at.
NOw one thing more unto the vulgar sort concerning the several sorts of
weapons, because unto many it seems so strange, that if a Master of Defense
should tell them that he can teach thee skill at Fence at twelve several sorts
of weapons, they will straightway say, that there are not so many: now for
their further satisfaction, they shall hear the division of more then twenty
sorts of weapons, which Masters of this Noble art of Defense, are, or, else
ought to be expert therein, like unto a skillful Cook which can of one sort of
meat make diverse dishes, or like the cunning Physician, who can with a herb
being diuersely compounded, make it serve to diverse purposes and uses: to which
effect my meaning is, that an expert Master of Defense can of one kind of
weapon make many, as by this sequel following shall appear, and all these
weapons have been played at in Challenges, here in England at several times.

Of the Sword are derived these seven.
The two hand Sword. The Back-sword. Sword and Dagger. Sword and Buckler. Short
Sword and Dagger. The short Sword and Gantlet. The Bastard Sword, the which
Sword is something shorter then a long Sword, and yet longer then a Shortsword.
Now with the Rapier seven more.
The first Rapier and Dagger. The single Rapier. The case of Rapiers. The
Rapier and Cloak. The Rapier and Target. The Rapier and Gantlet. The Rapier
and Pike. The Dutch Fauchin. The Poll-axe. The Battel-axe. The two Daggers. The
single Dagger. The Halfe-pike. The Long-pike. The Long-staffe. The
Quarter-staffe. The Welch-hooke or Bill. The Haulbert. The Rapier and Dagger
against Short-sword and Dagger. Likewise Rapier and Dagger, or Sword and Dagger
against a Staff or Haulbert. Also the Staff against a Flaile. Back-sword
against sword and dagger. Single Rapier against Rapier and Dagger.
Now my second book which is already in hand shall show my judgment, and the
chiefest rules according unto my practice at all these several weapons, if
death do not prevent me before I have accomplished my pretense, yet for doubt
thereof, the defense of the Staff with a Rapier and Dagger, or with Sword and
Dagger I will give thee a little direction, which being practiced it may stead
thee as much as thy life is worth. I do this the rather, and for because that
the Staff is a weapon which many men do carry, and with skill it has great
odds against either of the two aforesaid weapons, but yet because every man
which carries a weapon, has the perfect skill in that weapon which he
carries, but admit that he has good skill, yet in knowing the best Defense,
it may prevent thee from a danger.

Now thou must remember if thou be charged upon with a Staff, suddenly summon
up thy wits in that which before hand thou have learned for thy Defense, and
think this with thy self; I am now to encounter against a Staff: why then
thus frame thy guarde, put thy Dagger acrosse on the inside of thy Rapier or
Sword, and let the cross be made within half a foot of thy Rapier or
Sword-hilt, bearing up both thy hilts even so high as thy cheek, looking with
both thy eyes betwixt both thy weapons.

Thus being guarded, it may be, that thine enemy will charge thee with a
thrust, for because thy breast will seem most open to him, the which and if
he do, then turn down the point of thy Rapier and Sword, and with thy
Dagger force him down which will be a stronger Defense then with one alone:
and thus by turning down both thy points together, strike thine enemies thrust
of the Staff toward thy right side: Lo, thus do me with both thy weapons;
then will thine enemies thrust pass clear under thy right arm, but neither
with the Sword nor yet with the Dagger alone; the thrust of a staff is not to
be defended without greater danger then with both of them, as before has been
rehearsed.

Now and if thine enemy do chance to charge thee with a blow, thereby
thinking to drive both thy Rapier and Dagger, or Sword and Dagger unto thy
head: For I have known many to be of that opinion with me. But the blow of a
Staff, struck at the head, may be defended with the single Sword or Rapier
according unto the Backe-sword rule: but to bear thy Dagger with thy Rapier or
Sword, that is the most sure way, keeping both thy points upright, and so to
bear them toward the right side, or to thy left side, according as thou shall
perceive thine enemy charge thee.

Thus will I here conclude and make an end with this short direction
concerning this one weapon, because I have spoken something already touching
and concerning this purpose, although it be not so ample as now it is, and yet
hereafter (by Almighty Gods good help) I will speak more at large hereof,
of, this only serves but to rowze up your spirits, that you may the better
prepare your self for the next. The horse starteth at the Spur, so (in love)
I prick you forward in this commendable Art: and so, I hope, that this
Whetstone will make your blunt Wits somewhat sharper: Gold is not put in the
fire to be consumed, but to be purified; even so I hope, the travel which I
have taken herein will not make you to prove worse, but rather somewhat the
better in all goodness.

FINIS.
My farewell to Plymouth.
MOST noble Plymouth, the great love which I found in thee amongst both rich
and poor, now draws me back again to give thee a now draws me back again
to give thee a kind and hearty farewell, and yet at this time I yield but
only thanks as my pay- Mistress, but yet I desire not to die indebted,
without making some better recompense to some of my chiefest well-willers and
friends, if my ability prove answerable to my mind: for a Christmasse banquet
may be requited at Easter, and so when I am better able I will make amends; but
yet me thinks I should not leave so famous a town with such a threed-bare
farewell, but here may a question arise of those which know it not, why it
should be more famous then any other town? which I will tell thee, set her
wealth and riches aside, yet for that only not the like town in this land of
her bigness, I mean so long as the wars continued, she is also famous for her
strong fortification, but more famous for her entertainment; for twenty
thousand strangers have had upon a sudden good and sufficient lodging, and
other necessaries; yea, whether they have had money, or not, but most famous of
all for her gallant harbors, for a thousand ships may safely ride, and all
within half a league of the Town; it is the chief arriving place for all the
South and Weast Countries: and in a word, the only Key of England. In the time
of wars Plimmouth flowed, as it were, with milk and honey, and then it
flourished with Gallants great store, tracing the streets so thick in swarms
like as at westminster in a Term time, and although many of them went away
without bidding thee farewell; yet I will, as it were, bite thee by the finger,
because thou shall remember me, for if it be not possible for the mother to
forget her child, then (without all peradventure) I shall never forget thee:
Once thou were a golden place, but now an iron or a leaden town, I mean, in a
manner turned vpside down, which makes me sorry, and many more; but yet be of
good cheer, for after a storm comes a calm: pluck up thy heart, and let it
not grieve thee to see a King content with his kingdom; for if it were not so,
it should be so.

Although of late thy purse has had a strong purgation, which makes some of
you to shrink up the shoulders like a Spaniard, and hang down the head like a
bull-rush, and repenting your selves, that you had not kept the goods better
which you got in time of wars; and this me thinks I hear some of you say
your selves: Oh what a fool was I that took not Time by the fore-locke before
he did pass away, but must now catch at her balde pate, where is nothing to
hold by: let it not grieve thee, for if thou had those goods again, they
would consume like butter against the Sun: for as it is not possible to keep
the Indian beef sweet two days, with all the salt in the world, no more is
the goods got by the wars to be of any continuance, no although a man had
them that were as wise as wit could make them, but it seldom comes into such
men's hands, but rather unto such as resemble Rufus the Ruffian which had God
pictured on the in side of his Target, and the devil on the outside, with this
poesy on the inside, If thou will not have me, the other shall: as not
caring whether he went to God or the devil: many such fellows attend upon the
fortune of the wars, making havoc and spoil, and many times murdering those
that never meant hurt unto them nor their king for whom they fight: for yet
such, as I say, make no conscience, but as the Proverb goes, Rob Peter and
pay Paul, accounting all fish which comes to the net, getting it by hook or
by crook, some out of Judas bag, and some out of the devils budget: for I have
seen a man of war, as hungry upon a poor Fisherman, as they would be on a
Carioke, as those that have seen men of war, have seen how unconscionably
Rufus the ruffian and his fellows have dealt with those poor Fishermen whose
whole estate, for maintenance both for their wifes, and children, did rely
upon the gains, which the poor men by great pains did get with their bote,
yet so hard-hearted have these men of war been unto those poor Fishers, that
neither for the tears of the old men, which for grief would beat their
heads against the ship side, yet neither this nor the pitiful complaint of
the young men, for all their yielding and kneeling, yet would they take away
their fish, their meat and drink, and their cloths from their backs, their
sails from their yards, yet not so contented, but in the end set them ashore,
and either finke their boat or burn him aboard the man of war, to the utter
undoing of many a poor man; now judge whether it be possible, that these goods
so gotten can prosper, for they are gotten with no better a conscience then a
strumpet gets her money; and therefore it will prosper no better: for look
what a strumpet gets of twenty, she spends it upon one which she does
love and affect above all the rest: even so, many soldiers and men of war,
what spoils they get, they are not long in spending of it: but as the Proverb
goes, Light come, and light go: ill got, and wickedly spent: for they put it
into a bottomless bag, which never holds thrist long.

Lo, thus my opinion you have heard, and I yield up my verdict thus, That the
goods which is gotten by the wars, is ill gotten: and he which has but one
penny worth of ill gotten goods in his house, God will send a curse upon all the
rest: then let us pray for peace, rather then wars, and every man learn to
labor with his hands, to maintain spending: wherefore, set thy wits and thy
hands to labor, and turn over the leaf; I mean, learn a new lesson, for
look what is gotten with labor, will be spent with discretion, or else kept
with wariness; and so I greet not only Plimmouth alone, but all Devonshire
and Cornwall, with as many kind commendations, as it is possible for my Pen
to express, and all I protest with true love from my heart, and so I leave
you, with a thousand Farewells to you all.

Your euer-louing friend, JOSEPH SVVETNAM,.

The Authors Conclusion.
NOw (gentle Reader) I do entreat thee to bear with my rudeness, I am no
Scholar, for I do protest I never went to School six months in all my life,
nor I never did write one line of this Book by the direction of any other
teacher; nor did I ever ask the opinion of any other Professor, since the time
that I was first taught, and that was when I was young; and then I had some of
my skill in London, and some in other places, where it was my chance to travel.
Again, I did write this Book by peecemeale; for after I first began, I lest
off writing a week, and sometimes a month together, before I writ again; and
so forgetting oftentimes what I had written before. Again, some chief notes I
have left out, which I thought I had written of before: wherefore they shall
follow in my second Book. Now (Gentle Reader) for thy benefit I have begun,
if there be any other that find fault, and cannot amend it, let them judge of
their wit that hear them talk: but if I shall hear those my self speak
against this Book which do not go about to amend it, then if they were as
good as George a Green, yet would I not be feared with deeds, much less with
words, but will answer them, not only with words, but with weapons, for this
Book was printed in haste, at the carnest request of some friends of mine.
Also I wrote it to profit those that can not come where Teachers are* and
again, there are few which teach this Art that do travel, the reason is, as
I think, they are little set by when they come into the country amongst you:
Now it is not enough to have this book in thy pocket, but to exercise thy body
with all, that thereby thou may have the perfect skill thereof in thy head,
and so praying thee to excuse me in the gross penning of it, and bear with me
a little the rather in that I was never Scholar, as I said before, and as it
plainly appears by the gross penning of it, but my folly herein shall be upon
my head, yet I pray thee let it pass a little the rather, and give it your
good word, for because I have taken pains in hope to do thee good, but not
for any gain (I protest before God) but only because I know it so laudable an
exercise, and more commendable then any other, we see daily these books
scoffed at, which were made by learned and good Scholars, for if there were
one which excel ten thousand, yet every one will not speak well of him, but
he shall have in spite of his teeth back-biters and fault-finders, much more
my self being the lest of ten thousand must not stabbe every one which will
speak in discommendations, both of me and my Book, but if I may escape
handwhich are usually contemnors of such laudable exercises: then I account
that I have made a good hand.

For herein I have showen but my own opinion and judgment in setting out this
book, now I do not say it is other men's opinions: for none but my self was
counsel, nor had any hand in this matter; therefore I make no question that
other men are of other minds, yet observing these rules, and bearing these
lessons in memory, they may serve thy turn as well as they have served mine all
the days of my life hitherto: but yet believe what you list of it, and leave
what you like not, now if in my good intention and true meaning I be
undeservedly wronged, I think it will be by none but such pot-companions which
cudgel there wits and beat their brains to shift for money to that use which
oftentimes makes the son so hardy as to call his father knave, or worse.

Now if my book do come unto the view of any such, I will impute it unto the
Idleness of their brain, or unto the spitefulness of an envious mind, which
will never commend nor allow any other man's manhood, opinion or judgment to
be so good as their own, not much like unto the proud Pharizee, who said
that his life in all respect was better then any other, now mistake me not,
for I do not say so, because you should think that this work cannot be
mended, for it is far from my thought to think that this book is so well
penned as to be without fault, or to please all, neither is it so well as it
might have been, if my leisure would have served me to amend some faults which
I know in it my self, indeed, I must confess that there are many in this land
of this noble and worthy art besides my self, which might have taken this
matter in hand, because many of them are more fit both for wisdom and
learning, but I see they have not gone about it, wherefore if any blame me for
showing my good will, I hope those which have known me and seen my behavior
will answer for me with reasonable speech against those which object against
me: no, if reason will not rule them, but like Balaams Ass, will strive
against weapons, then I pray you refer the quarrel unto my self, and let me
answer my own wrong which I have done them herein, for I had rather loose my
life in defense of my reputation and credit, if there were such a danger in
fighting, then my friend should loose one drop of blood in my quarrel:
therefore while I am living, wrong me not, for he which fights for another,
seeks his own destruction, so praying you if I have offended any, let me
answer it my self while I am living, for when I am dead he deals
unchristianlike, that will abuse me: and so I rest,

Thine ever to help thee hereafter in what I may, Thy friend, JOSEPH SVVETNAM.
