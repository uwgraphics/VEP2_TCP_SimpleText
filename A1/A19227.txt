Constance of Cleueland.
A very excellent Sonnet of the most fair Lady Constance of Cleueland and her
disloyal Knight.

To the tune of Crimson Velvet.


IT was a youthful Knight,
loved a gallant Lady,
Fair she was and bright,
and of virtues rare:
Her self she did behave
so courteously as may be,
Wedded were they brave,
joy without compare.
Here began the grief,
Pain without relief,
her husband soon her love forsook,
To women lewd of mind
Being bad inclined,
he only lent a pleasant look:
The Lady she sat weeping,
While that he was keeping
company with others more:
Her words my Love, believe not,
Come to me and grieve not,
Wantons will thee overthrow.
His fair Ladies words
nothing he regarded,
Wantonness affords
such delightful sport:
While they dance and sing,
with great mirth prepared,
She her hands did wring
in most grievous (...)*
Oh what hap had I
Thus to wail and cry,
unrespected every day*
living in disdain*
While that others gain
all the right I should enjoy*
I am left forsaken,
Others they are taken,
ah my Love* why do thou so?
Her flatteries believe not, etc.
The Knight with his fair Piece,
at length his Lady spied,
Who did him daily fleece
of his wealth and store:
Secretly she stood,
while she her fashions tried,
With a patient mood,
while deep the Strumpet swore:
O sir Knight, quoth she,
So dearly I love thee,
my life does rest at thy dispose,
By day and eke by night,
For thy sweet delight,
thou shall me in thy arms disclose.
I am thine own for ever,
Still will I persevere
true to thee where ere I go.
Her flatteries believe not, etc.
The virtuous Lady mild
enters then among them,
Being big with child,
as ever she might be.
With distilling tears
she looked then upon them*
filled full of fears*
thus replied she:
Ah my Love and Dear,
Wherefore stay you here,
refusing me your loving wife,
For an Harlots sake,
Which each one will take,
whose vile deeds provoke much strife*
Many can accuse her,
O my Love refuse her,
with thy Lady home return:
Her flatteries believe not,
Come to me and grieve not, etc.
All in fury then
the angry Knight vpstarted
Uery furious, when
he heard his Ladies speech:
With many bitter terms
his wife he ouerthwarted,
Using hard extremes,
while she did him beseech.
From her neck so white*
He took away in spite
her curious chain of finest gold,
Her Jewels and her Rings,
And all such costly things,
as he about her did behold.
The Harlot in her presence,
He did gently reverence*
and to her he gave them all*
He sent away his Lady,
Full of woe as may be,
who in a sound with grief did fall*
The second part,
To the same tune.


AL his Ladies wrong
the Harlot ^leer'd and laughed,
(...)ements are so strong,
they overcome the wife:
(...) knight nothing regarded,
to see the Lady scoffed,
^his was her reward,
(...) her enterprise.
(...) Harlot all this space
(...) him often embrace,
she flatters him, and thus does say,
^or thee I Will die and live,
^or thee my faith I Will give,
no woe shall work my Loves decay.
(...) shall be my treasure,
(...) shall be my pleasure,
thou shall be my hearts delight:
(...)ll be thy darling,
(...) be thy worldling,
(...) ^espight of Fortunes spite.
(...) he did remain
(...) wastfull great expenses,
(...) itbred his pain,
and consumed him quite:
(...) his Lands were spent,
(...)ubled in his senses,
(...) he did repent
(...) his lewd delight:
(...) (...)liefe he hies,
(...) (...)liefe he flies,
(...) them on whom he spent hi^ gold,
^ll do him deny,
^ll do him defy,
(...) will not once his face behold.
(...) thus distressed,
(...) thus oppressed,
(...) the fields that night he lay,
^ith the Harlot knowing,
(...)gh her malice (...)ing*
(...)ght to take his (...) away.


A young and proper Lad,
they had slain in secret,
For the gold he had:
whom they did convey,
By a Ruffian lewd,
to that place directly,
Where that youthful Knight
fast a sleeping lay:
The bloody dagger than,
Wherewith they killed the man,
hard by the Knight he likewise laid,
Sprinkling him with blood,
As he thought it good,
and then no longer there he staid.
The Knight being so abused,
Was forthwith accused
for this murder which was done,
And he was condemned,
That had not offended,
shameful death he might not shun.
When the Lady bright
understood the matter,
That her wedded Knight
was condemned to die,
To the King she went
with all the speed that might be,
Where she did lament
her hard destiny:
Noble King, quoth she,
Pity take on me,
and pardon my poor husbands life,
Else I am undone,
With my little son,
let mercy mitigate this grief.
Lady fair, content thee,
Soon thou would repent thee,
If he should be saved so:
Sore he has abused thee,
Sore he has misused thee,
therefore Lady let him go*


O my Liege, quoth she,
grant your gracious favor,
Dear he is to me,
though he did me wrong:
The King replied again,
with a stern behavior,
A Subject he has slain,
die he* shall ere long,
Except thou can find
Any one so kind,
that will die and set him free.
Noble King, she said,
Glad am I apaid,
the same person will I be,
I will suffer duly,
I will suffer truly,
for my Love and husbands sake.
The King therefore amazed,
Though he her duty praised,
he bade that thence he should her take.
It was the Kings command,
on the morrow after,
She should out of hand,
to the Scaffold go:
Her husband pointed was,
to bear the sword before her,
He must eke alas,
give the deadly blow:
He refused the deed,
She bade him proceed,
with a thousand kisses sweet.
In this woeful case,
They did both embrace
which moved the Ruffian in yt place
Straight for to discover
This concealed murder,
whereby the Lady saved was
The Harlot then was hanged,
As she well deserved,
this (...)ertue bring to pass.
FINIS.
