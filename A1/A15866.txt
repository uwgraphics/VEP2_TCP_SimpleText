A GUIDE UNTO SION. OR Certain Positions, concerning a true visible Church.

Wherein The nature of a true Church is so plainly described, as all men may
easily decerne the same from false assemblies.

Written by a learned and judicious divine.

Jer. 50. 5. They shall ask the way to Sion, with their faces thitherward,
saying: come and let us join our selves to the Lord, in a perpetual Covenant,
that cannot be forgotten. Printed at Amstelredam, in the year 1638.

A GUIDE UNTO SION. OR Certain Positions, concerning a true visible Church.
THis our English word Church, through custom of speech is commonly used for
the Temple or place where people come together for the worship of God; but they
that are any thing exercised in religion, know, that it also signifies the
People* which gather together for divine service, and this is the first and
proper meaning of the word Church, as it is used to express the original
Scripture terms, Kahal and Ecclesia.

2. This name Church, we Englishmen (which came of the Saxons) have received
from the Saxon, German, and Dutch names Cyric, Kirch, Kerck; whereby those
nations now, do usually call their Temples or meeting-places: but the people
which come together in them, they call the Gemeine, and the Gemeinte, that is to
say, the Comunialtie; and we in our first English Bibles caled it, the
Congreation.

3 As all religion is learned out of holy scriptures, so the name and doctrine
of the church, is from thence to be deduced; and there the Church is called in
Hebrew Deuteronomy. 5. 22
Kahal or Deuteronomy. 33 4
Kehillah, which signifies a Convocation or Assembly of people, and Exodus 16.
1. Psalm. 111. 1.
Ghnedah, that is to say a Congregation: in Greek it is named Math. 16 18. Act.
7 38.
Ecclesia, that is in like manner, a Convocation, or people called forth to an
assembly, and sometime ^am. 2. 2. and in the Greek of the old Test. often Deuteronomy.
5. 22. Exodus 16. 3. etc.
Synagogue, that is a Congregation: which word is also used for the Luke 7. 5
Act. 18. 7.
place wherein the people assembled.

4. The Hebrew word Kahal is diversely used; sometimes more generally for a
great or universal multitude, as Genesis 35. 11. ^er 50. ^
of nations and Genesis 48 4 Ezekiel. (...). 24
of peoples; sometimes more particularly for an assembly of one nation, as of
Exodus 12. 6.
the Israelites; sometimes for a part of them, as 1. Chrm. 13. 1. 2 4. 5 and
29. 1. 6. 2. Chron. 1. 2. 3.
the Elders and Governors; of some 2. Chron. 20. 4. 5.
of the tribes of Israel a part; or some 2. Chron. 30. 10. 13. 25
of all the tribes, even Ezra. 10 I.
men women and children: Genesis 49. 6.
and indifferently for any assembly, and this not only of Gods people, but of
Ezekiel. 27. 27 and 32. 22. and 38. 4. 7. etc.
heathens also and infidels.

5. Likewise the Greek word Ecclesia is of as large extent and signification;
used sometime for Ephe. 5. 23. etc Heb 12. 23.
the Church generally; sometime for a 1. Cor. 1. 2
particular church or congregation in a city; sometimes more particularly in
Romans 16. 5. 1. Cor. 16. 19. Colos. 4 15.
a house or family; sometimes (in the Greek version of the old testament) for
an assembly 2 Chronicles. 1. 3. etc.
of Governors, or company 1. Sam. 19. 20.
of Prophets, or congreation Psalm. 107. 32.
of the people: and finally for Ezekiel. 32. 3 Act. 19. 32 39. 41.
any assembly lawful or unlawful, of good men or of Psalm. 26. 5.
evil.

6. These words thus general, are in more special sort both by the scriptures,
and by use of speech among all religious people, restreyned and appelied to
such Assemblies and Congregations as are called and gathered for divine
exercises: and so our English name of Church is attributed peculiarly to
spiritual or religious assemblies, called ecclesiastical, and not to any other
assemblies civil or political.

7. Of religious or ecclesiastical assemblies generally considered, there any
many sorts in the world; all disallowed of God, save one sort only which he
acknowledges to be his, and has separated to him self from all the rest.

8. The many false sorts, may be reduced unto fowr; 1. The assemblies of Pagans
or heathen people, which profess some God, Gods, or Goddesses, whom they do
worship, ignorantly, having Romans 1. 25.
changed the truth of God into a lie, and so serving creatures, not (in deed)
the creator, which is blessed for ever, Amen. 2 The assemblies of Jews, who
profess the true God (after a sort) and allow the writings of Moses and the
Prophets, but abhor Christ Jesus our Savior, and reject the new Testament: 3
The assemblies of Mahometists, as Persians, Turks, Moors, etc. Which profess
also after their manner, that Alkoran;
one true God of whom Moses and the Prophets wrote, and acknowledge Azoar 4.
Azor 2. and 4. and 11.
Christ to be a Prophet sent of God, yea and the breath or Spirit of God, yet
believe they not that he is Azoar 12. etc.
God, or the Azo. 19. ^0.
son of God, or Savior of the world, but follow the lies and fabels of their
false Prophet Mahomet. 4. Finally the church or assemblies of false Christians,
which profess God and his son Christ, into whose name they are baptized; but
by their works do deny him, and by their errors and heresies, do overthrow
the truth of religion.

9. The first three sorts, Pagans, Jews, and Mahometists, because of their so
open and manifest denial of Christ and salvation by him; are generally of
Christians reputed as no Churches; the latter are reputed no true but false
Churches, and so also do they esteem of true Christians, and one of another.
Hereupon is continual controversy between true and false Christians, which is
the true Church, and how it may be known.

10. To help the weak and doubtful in this case, I will so truly and plainly
as by the grace of God J can, describe the true Church, which in holy
Scriptures is called the Congreation and Church Nehem. 13. 1. 1 Timothy 3. 5. 14.
of God, consisting of godly and holy people named 1. Cor 1. 2. Psalm. 89 5. and
149. 1
Saints; opposed to the wicked or Psalm. 26 5
malignant churches, the Rev 2 9
Synagogues of Satan.

11. The true Church is a People 1 Pet. 2. 9
called of God by 2 These. 2 14.
the Gospel, John 17. 6. 9. 14 and 15. 19
from the world, unto the I Cor. 1.^
Communion or followship of his Son Jesus Christ, in whom they are Ephe. 2. 21.
22.
coupled and built together, to be the habitation of God by the spirit.

12. The Church is said to be a people, 1 Pet. 2. 9
nation or generation, because it consists of many persons, or of a multitude
little or great: for though a particular Christian is called, and of the
church; yet no one man is a church or congregation.

13. It is a people called; Ephe. 4. 1 Heb. 9. 15.
because every concourse or assembly is not a true Church: none of themselves
can come unto this estate, unless they be Rom 9. 11 12. 24. Song. 1. 3.
called or drawn thereunto: and they are said to be called of God; because he
Ioh 6. 44
only calls and draws men unto Christ with a 2. Tim. 1. 9.
holy calling; and adds them Act. 2. 47.
to his Church; 2 Chronicles 30. 6. 10. 12 Romans 8. 30.
no humane power or authority is able to do it.

14. The Gospel 2 These. 2 2^.
noted to be the means of our calling, he makes known unto his people
outwardly by his Cor. 5. 19
word Act. 5. 20.
spoken and (...) 20. 31.
written, and inwardly by Nehem. 9. 20. 1 Cor 2. 10 12
his holy spirit: and thus the Church are all Ioh. 6 45.
the taught of God.

15. The estate out of which the Church is called, is said to be out of or from
the ^^h. 15. 19 and 17. 69
world; whereby is meant, first Satan the Ioh. 12. 31.
Prince of this world, from whose power they are Act. 26. 18.
turned unto God; Secondly, the wicwicked people of the world, called the 10.
Children of the Devil, from whose communion and followship Exo. 34 15. Prove.
15. 8 Psalm. 16. 4 Ephesians. 5. 11. 2. Cor. 6. 17.
in their religion, and all other wicked actions, we must be separated; thirdly
the corruption of nature in our selves, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
eyes, and pride of life, Ioh. 2. 16
all which are of the world, and which we must Romans 7. 15. Jude. 23.
hate and Gal. 6. 14.
crucify, and so turn and become Mat. 18. 3
like little children, even born again, that we may see the kingdom of God.

16. The estate whereunto God calls his church in this life, Ioh. 3. 3.
is generally 1. Cor 1 9
to the Communion (or followship) of his Son Jesus Christ, as being their only
mediator and Savior, the Prophet Priest and King of the Church; which they
believing and professing, are also made partakers (in a proportion and in their
mesure) of these three offices with him.

17. Jesus Christ is the Deuteronomy. 1 15. 18. Act. 3. 22. 26.
Prophet raised up of God unto his people, to teach them all that God commanded
him: which also he did, both by Mat. 2. 5. etc
himself, and by the Ministry of his servants Ioh. 13. 20.
sent of him, And as Col. 2. 3.
all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid in him, so him the Church
must Mat. 17. 5
hear; for all Joh. 3. 13 and 6. 68. Rev. 5. 1. 5
heavenly wisdom and knowledge is to be learned of him; and every person
which shall not hear this Prophet, Act. 3. 23.
shall be destroyed out of the people.

18. This Prophetical office of Christ, he bath communicated with the church,
by giving Psa. 147 19. 20. Jsa. 59. 21 Romans 15. 4
to the same his word for their instruction and comfort, and Iam. 1. 21.
grafting the same within them, his spirit also as an 1 John 2. 20. 27.
Anointing to reach them all things; giving Ephe. 4. 8. 11. 1. Cor. 12. 28.
gifts also, or ministers, to open and apply the same unto their sowles,
likewise power and freedom by Jsa. 43. 10.
witness 2 Cor 4. 13
profession and Mat. 28
practice, to Phil. 2. 16.
hold forth that word of life as lights in the world: thereby to Act. 8. 4.
preach unto others the faith of Christ, to 1. These. 5. 11.
edify and build up one an other daily therein; to Heb. 10. 24.
provoke unto love and to good works; to Rom 15. 14.
a admonish and Levit. 19. 17.
reprehend for evil and iniquity; to Lnk. 17. 3.
forgive and 1. These. 4. 18.
comfort one another in the bowels of Christ; whose word therefore all ought to
labor that it may Col. 3. 16.
dwell plenteously in them; that if any man speak, it may be 1. Pet. 4. 11.
as the words of God.

19. Jesus the Son of God, is also the Heb. 4. 14. 20. Romans 5. 19.
great high priest or Sacrificer of the Church; by whose obedience, and
sacrifice or oblation of Heb. 10. 5. 10.
his own body and blood, the church is cleansed 1 Ioh 1. 7
from all syn, and Romans 5. 10.
reconciled to God; by whose intercession the church, with the holy actions and
oblations of the same, are Heb. 7. 25. and 9. 24. and 13. 15. Rev. 8. 3. 4.
accepted of God, and made heirs of blessing.

20. And this his Priestly office, is so imparted to his church, as they have
not only interest in his Isa. 53. 5. Romans 5. 8. 10.
death and sufferings whereby they are reconciled to God, but also are themselves
made 1. Pet. 2. 5.
a holy priesthood, to offer up spiriutal sacrifices acceptable to God by him:
giving up Romans 12. 1
their own bodies a living sacrifice; Col. 3. 5.
mortifying their members which are on earth, and Gal 5. 24
crucifying the flesh with the affections and lusts; offering up Psalm. 51. 17.
contrite and broken hearts, with Heb. 13. 15.
sacrifices of confession to his name; and praying not only every man for
himself, but Ephe. 6. 18
one for another, Heb. 13. 16.
doing and distributing to the necessities of the Saints; 2 Timothy 2. 3. 9.
suffering affliction for the Gospel; and finally, if they be called thereunto,
pouring out their sowles unto Heb. 12. 4 2 Timothy, 4. 6
death for the truths sake.

21. The Lord Jesus Christ, is also the Mat. 2. 6
governor and John. 12 and 15.
king over Sion Gods holy mount, and sits at his Fathers right hand and 1
Cor. 15. 25.
reigns til all his enemies be made his foot stool, being Jsa. 33. 22.
a King judge, and lawgiver to his people, Mat. 28 20.
commanding and ruling them by his word and spirit, Psalm. 72.
judging them in justice and equity, preserving and defending them by his
almighty power, John. 10. 28. and 16. 33. Rev 19. 11. 21.
from all their enemies.

22. And this his kingly office he so communicates with his church, as they
are by him preserved and defended from all adversary power; freed from the
dominion Romans 6. 14.
of syn, and tyranny of 1. Joh 5. 18 Romans 16. 70.
Satan; from subjection to 1. Ioh. 5. 4.
the world, and servitude 1. Cor. 7. 23.
unto men: and restored to the joyful liberty of the children of God, 1 Cor.
3. 22.
the world and all things in it made theirs: that housoever they have still to
combat 1 Pet 5. 8. 9
with the Divil, to Ephe. 6. 12.
wrestle against principalities and powers; to suffer Joh. 15. 19. and 16. 32.
hatred and affliction of the world; and to war with the fleshly lusts 1.
Pet. 2. 11.
which fight against the sowl: yet neither Romans 8. 38. 39.
death; nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things
present, nor things to come, nor height nor deepth, nor any other creature,
shall be able to separate them from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
our Lord; who has Rev. 1. 6.
made them Kings and priests unto God even his Father, and they shall Rev 5. 10
reign on the earth; till having served here their time, they come to 2 Timothy ^
12. Ioh. 17 24. 1 These. 4. 17.
reign with him in glory, in the heavens for ever.

23. Unto the participation of these promises and heavenly graces, are Mat. 28.
19. Romans 16. 26.
all people provoked by the Gospel preached; and such as obey the calling of
God, and come unto Christ, are united to him their head and mediator, from whom
proceeds the Justification and sanctfication of the church.

24. Justification is the partaking of Christ's Phil. 3. 9.
justice or righteousness, in his fulfilling and obeying Romans 5. 19.
the law of God, and discharging Joh. 1. 7.
all our debts and trespasses by his death; so freeing us Gal. 3. 13.
from the curse, and setting us in full favor Romans 5. 10
with God and under his Gal. 3. 9 14.
blessing: which righteousness of Christ's, is fully made ours, and imputed to us
Romans 3. 25. 30. and 4. 24. 25.
by faith for our justification.

25. Sanctfication is the partaking of Christ's holiness, by being Romans 6. 5.
grafted with him to the similitude of his death and resurrection; whereby the
corruption of nature or verse. 6
old man in us, becomes crucified and auers. 4.
buried with him, and the Ephe. 4. 22. 24. Col. 3. 10.
new man or image of God is put on and renewed daily in a holy conversation.

26. Hitherto of the Churches union and communion with Christ her head: now
follows the union of the churches members one with another: which is their
Ephe. 2. 21. Rom 12. 4 5.
couplin^ together as one body by the communion (...) one and the same 1. Cor.
12. 4. 8. 9. 11. 12. 13. Ephe. 4. 4. 5. 15. 16.
spirit, faith, and love.

27. The union of the members one wit^ another is to be considered generally o^
totally; and particularly. Generally as the church is called universal or
catholic, comprehending the Ephe. 3. 15.
whole family of God i^ heaven and in earth, and the 1. Pet. 5. 9.
fraternity o^ brotherhood of all Christians which are is the world; in whom
there is but Ephesians. 4. 5.
one faith, in 1 Cor 8. 6. and 12. 4. 5. etc. Ephesians. 2. 18. and 4. 4. 5. 6.
one and the same God by that one Lord Jesus Christ, through one Spirit. Thu^
have they all one Father which is God, one mother, Gal. 4. 26.
Jerusalem which is above; and by the mediation of Christ are all made John.
17. 21.
one, baptized by one spirit into 1 Cor, 12. 13
one body, and al^ made to drink into one spirit.

28. More particularly, they that are called of God, and members of the Church
universal, are united and gathered into many g churches or congregation, in Reu
1. 11.
several cities and countries Act. 2. 41. 42. 47. and 5. 13. Heb. 10. 25.
every of which curche being joined together in the profession and practice of
the Gospel of Christ, 1 Cor. 5. 4.
have his (...) power and Mat. 18. 20.
presence with them, and is convene or come 1 Cor. 11. 20. 33. and 4. 5.
together in one, for the worship of God, and performance of public duties.

29. Whatsoever promise or blessing of God, is bestowed on the church on earth
generally considered: the same may be apprehended and enjoyed by every
particular Church, (though not in like measure by all:) as the Exodus 20 24.
Mat. 18. 20. Jsa. 4. 5.
promises general, and examples particular of the Church 1. Cor. 3. 22. 23.
and 1. 7. 30. etc. Rev. 2. and 3.
in Corinth, and others mentioned in the Scripture, do confirm.

30. The Testament of Christ shows us no Provincial National, Emperial, or
other like Church, having several meetings or assemblies, and special Pastors
over the same: neither, since the Apostles, Prophets and Evangelists were taken
from this world, are there any other lawful Bishops or church governors, then
Bishops or Overseers Act. 20. 17. 28. Phil. 1. 1. 1 Pet 5. 1. 2
of the particular churches; neither ever was there other lawful Head, Lord, or
Lords spiritual, of the church, then Col. 1. 18. I Cor. 8. 6. and 12; 5.
Jesus Christ alone.

31. Unto the Church are to be admitted, all unto whom the covenant and promise
of God does apperteyn; and they are so ma^y Act. 2.
as the Lord our God shall call; and all those are called (in the judgments of
man,) which having Romans 10 17. Ephesians. I 13.
heard the word of God, do profess Act. 2. 38. 41. and 8. 37.
repentance from dead works and faith in God, by Jesus Christ the alone Savior
of the world, and promise Exodus 19. 5. 8. 2. Chron. 34. 31. Luke 1. 17. Ioh. 2.
26. Romans 1. 5. Mic. 5. 4.
obedience to the word, through the holy Ghost the sanctifier of the elect. Such
of Gal. 3. 28
all sorts and estates of people in the world, are with their Genesis 17. 7. 1.
Cor. 7 14.
leed to be received into, and nourished in the church; their ignorance being
helped by Gole. 1. 28. and 3 16.
instruction, their weakness Romans 15. 1. etc.
born by lenity, their faults corrected Gal. 6. 1. Lnvit. 19. 2. 17.
with love and meeknes; and their feeble consciences 1 These 5. 14.
comforted with the promise of God.

32. Out of the Church are Mat. 3. 7 2. Cor. 6. 14. etc. 27. and 22. 15. Isa.
35. 8. 9. Zach. 14. 21.
all such to b^ kept, as are profane, wordly and wicked, u^till they be called
of God unto repentance and faith in his promise; for every Church rightly
constituted, must consist of faithful^ and holy persons. Our reasons are these.
1. The Scriptures Rev. 21. Mat. 18. 17. 1. Cor. 5. 5. 11. 12. Tit. 3. 10. Number.
15. 30. 31.
every where so teac^ 2. All wicked men are forbidden expres^^ by tthe word of
God, Iohoa. 17. 20. etc.
from meddling wit^ his covenant, or ordinances, 3. they have no^ Christ for
their head 1. Cor. 14. 36.
and therefore cannot be of his body. 4, The godly and wicked are contraries,
guided and let by different causes: now two contraries are not capable of one
and the same form. Gal. 5. 17
5. Only faithful men worship God aright, please him, are accepted of him, and
have right to the covenant of grace and seals thereof.

The ordinary officers, perpetually be longing to all true Churches. Are
Pastors Teachers Elders Deacons and Helpers

The election and ordination of them must be made by the free chose of the
congregation Act. 6, and 14, 13 and 15, 2. 3, 22. 2 Cor. 8, 19.
of which they are members, and wherein they are to administer. And this is
clear. 1. Because the Apostles Act. 1, 15. 24, and chap. 6, 2, 3, 4. 1 Timot.
3 2. 3, 4, 5.
who only taught Christ's commandments* so established the primitive churches.
2. The people amongst whom they have been conversant can best judge of their
fitnes both in ^espect of their persons and families. 3. It ^^rtheretn much the
diligence and faithfulness of the minister, that they whose minister ^s have
freely chosen him, as unto whom under Christ they commit the most precious
treasure of their soul: as also it binds the people to greater love and
conscience of obedience of him and his ministry whom themselves have made
choice of. 4. The Church being a most free corporation, spiritual under
Christ the Lord, is in all reason and equity to choose her ministers and
servants under him, unto whom also, she is. to give wages for their service
and labor.

34. The Pastor must be apt to teach, 1 Timothy 3. 1.
no young scholar, able to divide the word a right; 2 Timothy 2, 15.
he must be a man that loves goodness; Tit. 1, 9.
he must be wise righteous, holy, temperate; he must be of life unreproveable,
as God steward; 2 Timothy 4, 2, Tit. 17, 8.
he must be generally well reported of and one that rules his own house hold
under obedience with all honesty, he must be modest Numb. 12. 3, 4. Esa. 50,
4, 56, Ier. 3, 15, Eze. 34, 18. 1 Timothy 5. 21.
humble, meek, gentle, and loving: he must be a man of great patience,
compassion, labor, and diligence: feed the sheep of Christ in green and
wholesome pastures of the word: pray for them, seal up to them the promises of
God by the Sacraments: He must always be careful and watchful over the Flock
of Christ, Ps. 23. Levit. 10, 10.
defend it from ravenous beasts, loh. 10, 11, 12. Song. 2, 15
and the wolf, and take the little Foxes: discern men's deseases, and apply
the word according to every disease, and every time and occurrant: And these
things he must do with all willingness and chearfulnes, not holding his office
in respect of persons, but doing his duty to every soul, as he will answer
before the chief Shepherd, etc.

35. The Doctor 1 Timothy 3. chap. Tit. 1, cha. 2 Timothy 2, 15. 1 Cor. 1, 17, and.
2, 4. 1 Cor. 3, 11, 12, Mal. 2 6, Ephesians. 2, 20. Heb 6 1. 1 Cor. 1, 17. 1 Timothy
4. 16, and 6, 20.
or Teacher must be a man apt to teach, mighty in the Scriptures, able to
convince the gainsayers: He must be of life unreproveable, one that can govern
his own househould, he must be of manners sober, temperate, modest, gentle,
and loving: He must take diligent heed to keep the Church from errors:
preserve knowledge, build upon the rock (which is Jesus Christ) gould, silver,
and precious stones, that his work may endure the trial of the fire, and by
the light of the same fire, reveal the timber, hay, and stubble of false
Teachers: And further, he must deliver his doctrine pure, sound, and plain,
not with curiosity or affectation, but so that it may edify the most simple,
approving it to every man's conscience, that the Church may increase with the
increasing of God, and grow up unto him which is the head Christ Jesus.

36. That this is an Office different from that of the Pastor, is manifest by
these reasons. 1. The Apostle does so distinguish them one from another. Romans
12, 7, 8. Ephesians. 4, 11. 2. Their gifts appear to be diverse, 1 Cor. 12, 8. 3.
The Pastor is commanded to take one course in Teaching, the Doctor another,
Romans 12, 7, 8. 4. This distinguishing of them makes more for the building of
the Church, then to unite and make them one.

37. The third Officers, 1 Timothy 3 and 5. chap. Number. 12. 24 25. 2 Chro. 10 8,
Act. 15, Numb 11 16, Deu 1 13, and 18. Exo. 39, 42 1 Timothy 3, 15, Gal. 2, 45,
Colos. 4 16, 17 Rom 12, 8 1 Cor. 11. 16 and 14 33. Act 20, 1 Pet. 51 Heb 54
are Governors, or Ruling Elders; These men must be of life likewise
unreproveable, sober, gentle, loving, temperate: Governing their own Families
orderly: they must be men of wisdom, knowledge, and sound judgment, able to
discern between cause and cruse, between plea and plea, and accordingly to
prevent and redress evils. Their especial care must be to see the Ordinances
of God truly taught and practiced, as well by the officers in doing their
duties uprightly, as to see the people obey willingly and readily: It is their
duty to see the congregation holily and quietly ordered, and no way disturbed
by the contentious and disobedient, froward and obstinate: Not taking away the
liberty of the least, but uphoulding the right of all, wisely judging of times
and circumstances. They must be ready assistants to the Pastor and Teacher,
helping to bear their burden, but not intruding into their office.

38. It is necessary that these Officers be perpetually resident upon their
charge. For 1. a Minister is a Shepherd, and his charge a Flock; now a
shepherd has a flock to feed it continually. 2. Wheresoever God places a
man, there is daily need of his labor and care. 3. The people are in danger
of harm if they be not watched over day and night. 4. The Church requires an
Officers residencie with her, as a duty of him. 5. If they do otherwise, they
cannot give their people a good example, neither will there belove and
familiarity between them.

39. Deacons Act. 6, 3 1 Timothy 3, 8, 9. Rom, 12, 8
must be men of honest report, endued with the Holy Ghost, they must be grave,
temperate, not given to excess, nor to filthy lucre: Faithfully ought they to
gather and collect by the Ordinance of the Church, the goods and benevolence of
the faithful, and by the same direction diligently and trustily to distribute
them according to the necessity of the Saints. Further, they must inquire and
consider of the portion and the wantes both of the Officers and other poor,
and accordingly relate to the Church that provision may be made. 40. That the
Deacons Office is not to meddle with the Word and Sacraments, but only to
collect the benevolence of the faithful, and faithfully to distribute the
same: is clear by these reasons. 1. It is an Apostolical institution, that
these should attend upon the provision for the poor, Act. 6, 4. 2. The
Scripture makes it an ordinary and distinct Office from others in the Church,
and not to be mingled with any other, Romans 12, 8. 3. No man can in any
tolerable measure discharge the Office of a Minister and a Deacon also, Act.
6, 2. 4. The Ministeries of the Word are perfect without it.

41. This Office was instituted, 1. That the faithful might be the more free
from fear, and follow their own callings diligently. 2. That the Church might
be the more enriched with Heavenly and Spiritual blessings, for the receives
grace and gifts, for the discharge of each calling. 3. To stir men up to
help the poor the more willingly, considering that the Lord has appointed a
special office for that purpose. 4. That there should be no complaints, but
that all the poor might be comforted against their poverty and wants.
Lastly, to show that as God has created soul and body, so he takes care for
both.

42. The Widows 1 Timothy 5 9. 10. Romans 12, 8
or Deaconesses must be Women of 60, years of age at the least. For avoiding
of inconveniences: they must be well reported of for good works, such as have
nourished their Children, such as have been harberous to strangers, diligent
and serviceable to the Saints, compassionate and helpefull to them in
adversity, given to every good work, continuing in supplications and prayer
day and night: They must minister to the sick, lame, weary and defeated such
helpefull comforts as they need, by watching, tending and helping them.

Further, they must show good example to the young women, in sober, modest, and
godly conversation, avoiding idleness, vain talk, and light behavior.

43. These are the necessary and only ordinary functions, 1 Cor. 1^ 28. Romans
12, 8*9 Ephesians. 4.8, 11, 12 13.
and offices, which our Savior has ordained in his Church, unto the due
administration whereof, he has promised his blessing to the end of the world.
And these are perpetual and to continue for ever, and beside these it is
unlawful for men (following the devises of their own brain) to institute or
ordain any in the Churches of God.

44. These offices though they be diverse and several, yet are they not
severed, least there should be a division in the body: Luk 9, 46, 47. Ioh. 13.
12 17. 1 Cor. 12. 12. 25, 28 Ephesians. 4, 11. 12. 13. 16.
but they are as members of the body, having the same care one of another,
jointly doing their several duties to the service of the saints: neither can
any of these offices be wanting without grevious lamenes and apparent
deformity of the body, yea violent injury to the head Christ Jesus.

45. As every Christian Congregation has power and commandment to elect and
ordain their own Ministers according to the rule in Gods word prescribed: So
right and power to practice all other ordinances of the Lord, and namely to
Mat. 18 17 18. 1 Cor. 5, 4. 5. 2 These. 3. 5. with Levit. 24 14. 15. 16 ^3.
cut of any memfrom the body: provided, that holy order of proceeding be
keept, which Christ in his will and Testament has left us.

46. The rule of Christ for excommunication is thus: If the fault be private,
holy and loving admonition and reproof is to be used, with an inward desire and
earnest care to win their brother: But if he will not hear, yet to take two
or three other brethren with him, whom he knows most meet for that purpose,
that by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may be confirmed: And
if he refuse to hear them, then to declare the matter to the church, which
ought severally and sharply to reprehend, gravely to admonish, and lovingly to
persuade the party offending: showing him the heynousnes of his offense, and
the danger of his obstinacy, and the fearful judgments of the Lord. Lev. 19.
17. 18. Mat. 18. 15. Devt. 19. 15. Mat. 18. 16.

47. All this notwithstanding the Church is not to hold him as an enemy, but
to admonish him and pray for him as a Brother; prooving if at any time the Lord
will give him repentance. For this power is not given them to the destruction
of any, but to the edification of all. 2. These. 3. 15. 2. Cor. 10. 8. and 13.
10.

48. If this preveale not to draw him to repentance, then are they in the Name
and power of the Lord JESUS with the whole Congregation, reverently in prayer
to proceed to excommunication, that is unto the casting him out of their
congregation and fellowship, covenant and protection of the Lord, for his
disobedience and obstinacy, and committing him to Satan, for the destruction
of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus, if
such be his good will and pleasure, Mat. 18. 17. 1 Cor. 5. 11.

49. If the offense be public, the party is publicly to be reproved, and
admonished: if he then repent not, to proceed to excommunication, as aforesaid.
1. Tim. 5, 20. Gal. 2. 14. Ios. 7. 19. 2 Cor. 7. 9.

50. Further they are to warn the whole congregarion and all other believers to
hold him as a Heathen and Publican, Mat. 18. 17. 1. Cor. 11.
and to withdraw themselves from him, from all spiritual communion, and civil
familiarity, so far as may be without the violation of any natural or civil
bond.

51. That obstinate sinners after due conviction and patience, must be censured
appears 1. By the commandment of Christ Mat. 18
and practice of the Apostolical 1. Cor. 5.
churches. 2. That the worship and service of God may Hag. 2. 13.
be kept and preserved from pollution, contempt and profanation. 3. That the
sinner may se his fault, be humbled 1 Cor. 5. 9. 2. These. 2. 14. 2. Cor. 6.
for it, and so saved in the day of the Lord. 4. That the honor and good name
of the church may be preserved, the which would be lost Rev. 2. 14. 15.
if vile persons were suffered therein. 5. To prevent the infection Heb. 12 15.
of others. 6. That by the zeal, e and holiness of the church, they without
Mat. 5. 16.
may be gained to the Gospel. 7. To glorify Gods great name which is much
impeached Eze. 36 20, 23.
by the unholy walking of those which profess his truth. 8. That others may
fear, Deuteronomy 17. 12. 13.
for if this course be omitted, it may be a means to embolden many to do the
like.

52. The repentance of the party must be proportionable to the offense, viz.
If the offense be public, public: If private, private: Humbled, submissive,
sorrowful, unfeigned, giving glory to the Lord. Lev. 19, 17, 18. Pro. 10. 12.
Romans 12. 19, and 13, 10, and 14. 1.

53. There must great care be had of admonitions, that they be not captious or
curious, finding fault where none is; neither yet in bitterness or reproach: For
that were to destroy and not to save our brother: But they must be carefully
done, with prayer going before, they must be seasoned with truth, gravitie,
love and peace. Mat. 18, 15. and 26, 8. Gal. 6, 1, 2. 2 Timothy, 2, 24. Mark. 9,
50. Ephesians, 4, 29, Iam. 5, 15, 19, 20.

54. More over, the Scripture shows us, that discreet, faithful and men able
to speak unto edification exhortation and comfort, (though not yet in office
of ministry) may open and apply the Scriptures in the church, for. 1. In the
Jewish Church Luke 2. 42. 46. 47. and cap. 4. 16. 17. 18 Act. 8. 4. and cap.
11. 19. 20. 21 and cap. 13. 14. 15. and cap. 18. 24. 25.
men out of office had liberty either in the Temple or Synagogue, publicly to
use their gifts. 2. In the time of the Apostles Act. 19. 18. 24. and cap. 18.
24 25.
and primitive churches men so preached, and the Lord himself approved it, and
that without any exception or prohibition to the contrary 3. Christ commanded
Luke 9. 1 and cap. 10. 1. d
this thing: and so did his Apostles afterward. 4. Romans 12. 9. 1. Pet. 4 10.
11. 1 Cor. 14. 34. 35.
The prohibiting of women 1 Timot. 2. 11. 12. 1 Cor. 14. 34. 35.
(not extraordinary inspired) to speak in the Church: clearly imports a
liberty therein given unto men their husbands and others. 5. Otherwise it would
follow, either that the people should be untaught Pro. 29. 18 Romans 10. 17. 1.
Cor. 1. 17. Rom 14 6. 7.
Or that now (after the general apostasy of Antichrist) 2 These. 2. 4. Rev. 18.
4. and 14. 12
there might be lawful Pastors and ministers had, before there were a church
to choose them, or a flock for the^ to watch over; or that unlawful ministeries
Pro. 9. 3. 2 Kiug. 23. 5. Ier. 51. 26. Zach. 13. 4. Act. 14. 13. Ezr. 2. 6. 63.
might be reteynd and executed, for bringing men to the knowledge and obedience
of the Gospel: all which are against the word of God. Lastly much good comes
by this means, as. 1. the glory of God, in the manifestation Pet. 4. 10. 1 1.
of his manifould graces 2. That the gifts in men be not quenched. 3. For the
fitting and trying of men for the ministry. 4. 1 These. 5. 19.
For the preserving pure of the Doctrine of the Church; 1 Timothy 3 2. 1 Cor. 14.
35.
which is more in danger, if some one or two alone only be heard and speak. 5.
For debating and satisfying of doubts if any arise. 6. For the edifying of the
Church and conversion of others.

55. As Christ (our Heavenly Prophet) has set forth unto us in the New
Testament the manner and form of the gathering and Constitution of the visible
Church: So he requires every faithful Christian, to make himself a member
of some particular Congregation, and there to present their bodies and souls,
and to bring the gifts which God has given them. Our reasons are these: 1.
Otherwise they are not to be admitted unto the Holy Sacraments, Mat. 26. 26.^9
and 28. 19. 20. Exo. 12. 43. 48. and 20. 7. Ast. 2. 38 41. and 8. 36. 37. Genesis
17.
the seals of Gods Covenant: For these ought not to be administered unto any,
except they be added unto some visible Church: unto which the public
ordinances and ministry does appertain. 2. Because of the presence of God
Rev. 1. 13. 1 Timothy 3. 5. Psalm. 65. 5.
and Christ: If we will come to God, we must come to that place where his
presence is in a special manner, and where he is to be found, of all such as
seek him with their whole heart. 3. Psalm. 119 6. Luke 1. 5
How else have we respect to all the Commandments. 4. That the Saints may
mutually edify each other, Iud. 20. Romans 1. 12 1 Cor. 11. 27.
and this follows upon their joining together in the fellowship of the Gospel.
5. To consider 1. These. 5. 14. Heb. 3 12, 13. and 1. 24. 25
, or observe our Brethren as we ought, watch over them, and seek to reduce
them unto a straight walking when they go astray. 6. Because of Gods Covenant
Psalm. 133 3. Esa. 60, 15. Deuteronomy. 4. 12, 13
and promise: For those which are in the Church, are directly (as it were)
joined to his blessings and graces, the which are powered forth there abundantly.

56. Such as join themselves unto true visible Churches ought first to go
unto the 1 Cor. 14 ult.
Elders, that by them their cause may be propounded to the whole Congreg:
afterward they are to come into the public assembly, and there make
confession Act. 19, 18. Romans 15. 9. 10. Psalm. 18. 49.
of their faith openly, and promise to walk in the obedience of Christ: and
thus being found worthy, by the consent of the whole Church they are joyfully
to be received into the holy communion of Saints.

57. As every established Church, has power and liberty to choose their own
spiritual and Ecclesiastical Officers: So, be it observed, that these
Officers are tied unto that only Congregation Act. 20, 28. 1 Cor. 7, 17.
of which they are members, and by which they were elected into office, and
ought not to bear any Ecclesiastical Office in another, neither can they
administer the holy things of God, as Officers and by virtue of a ministerial
calling any where, but in their own Congregation; No. More then a Major or
Bayliefe can execute civil justice out of the limitts and bounds of their own
privileged Corporation.

58. It is sure, that Christ Jesus has not subjected any Church or
congregation, of his, to any other superior Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, then
unto that which is within it self: Gal. 5. 1. Mat. 3. 2. Ephesians. 2. 19 1 Cor. 12.
20.
so that if a whole Church or congregation shall err in any matter of faith or
religion, noe other Church, or Church Officers, have (by any warrant from the
word of God) power to censure, punish or controile the same, but are only to
advise them: and so to leave their souls to the immediate judgment of Christ.

58. It is the duty of every Christian congregation to be careful, that no
infant be admitted unto Baptism a whose parenn (one at least) are not members
of some particular Church. For. Act. 2. 38. 39. and 16. 15. 33. Mat. 28. 19. 20
Genesis 17. 7 8. 12. Eolos. 2. 12 13. Romans 9. 41. Cor. 7. 14.
1. If they do Ex. 20.
, by this means Gods name is taken in vain 2. Mal. 1. 7 12. Heb. 10. 29. Hag.
2. 14. 5. Ezech. 44 7.
The holy Sacrament profaned, d 3. The Church of God de filed: d. 4. The
minister a covenant breaker. Mal. 28.
5. There is no precept nor example in the Scripture for it. 6. Such a practice
hinders many parents from embraceing the way and order of the Gospel, and
causes them to live and die libertines. 7. It induces ignorant people to
conceive such an absolute necessity of Baptism, as that men cannot be saved
without it.

58. All Christians are bound to practice Gods ordinances for his visible
Church under the Gospel although the Magistrate, Act. 4. 19. 20. Danil. 6. 9.
10. Mat. 10. 28. Rev. 2. 3. Cap.
allow not thereof, yea forbid them upon pean of death: For as the opprobation
of men and Angels; makes not the ways of God, and works of religion never a
whitt the more lawful, but only, the more free from bodily danger: so neither
can their disallowance make unlawful such duties of religion as the word of
God, approves, not can they give pispensation to any person, to for bear the
practice thereof. There is more of this subject shortly to be Publyshed.
