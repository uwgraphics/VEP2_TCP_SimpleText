TO THE WORTHILY Admired for Learning and Good Parts, Mr. Tho: Berney, Gent. of
Gray's Inn.
SIR,
I Thought my endeavors too poorly employed, while they were restrained to the
limits of a particular acknowledgement; which forced me to comply with my
ambitious humor, by making this public profession of my duty and observance.
I may seem both Ignorant and Indiscreet to promise any new thing in this
fardell of Epistles to you, who are able to give lessons of Courtship and
Civility to the most refined Spirits of this age, yet I deserve pardon, if you
consider that nothing is here but what might either have bin written by you,
or to you, and consequently deserves the approbation of the most malicious. For
in the one your own Humanity, and in the other the Judgment of all the world
is interessed: as is in all things that concern your Particular, the repose,

SIR, of Your most humble and most obedient servant J. M.

TO MY LORD, THE Abbot of Dorak, one of his Majesty's Privy Counselors, and
Treasurer of the Holy Chapel at Paris.
My Lord,
THe Particular esteem I have of your Merit, obliged me to these Public
Proofs; being Ambitious the world should know, that though my inclinations be
not strong enough to follow virtue, yet I never cease to build her Altars, in all places where I find her Image. To maintain (my Lord) that you are one of the
most lively, the Eloquence of your actions surpassing that of my Discourse, has
already persuaded it to all the world, so that your Honesty having made it self
known every where, I satisfy my self in praising you worthily, to declare
your name, being one of the most accomplished Prelates of this Age. I speak
not of those negotiations of Importance which you have finished, to the Honor
of the King, and Satisfaction of his Emminence who knew right well that the
greatest Employments were under the reach of your Capacity. I wish with
Passion, I had any in your service, whereby I might force you to believe that I
am extremely

My Lord, Your most humble, and most faithful servant, P. de La. Serre.

The Author to the Reader.
HAving had notice given me, that my Secretary of the Court, which I composed
for a Divertisement in my Youth, ran through the World in my Name, and with
some kind of Approbation in strange Countries: as being 30 times Printed, since
it was first published, and never falling into my hands to be corrected: I
thought good to present thee with this new one, which is a Digested work, and
where thou shall receive more satisfaction, as finding a less number of
faults. It bears the Name of Secretary in Fashion, to the end that it may be
always in season, considering how variable the manner of Writing is. Receive
it with as good a heart as I give it thee: and if it like thee not, learn
charitably to hold thy Tongue, or else to reproach with a good grace; it is the
best counsel I am aable to give thee.

Reader,
I Here present thee with a Cornucopia of knowledge and Expression. If thou
do not receive it with an acknowledgement proportioned to the Worth of such a
Gift, may thou acquire two Cornucopia's of Ignominy, to Adorn thy forehead,
and be condemned to the Reading of the English Secretary, as long as thou
live. If the whole Mountain of the Commonwealth (whereof thy self art a
molehill,) were as sensible as thou ought to be, I assure my self, she
would bow her venerable knees, and do me Homage for that mighty Portion of
Wit, and Courtshippe, whereof she goes now to take Possession. But I see thee
already blear-eyed with reading Monsieur Balzaac, and the Packet of Letters;
forgive me good Reader, I ask thee most humbly Mercy, and with much
Resentment call back my former Imprecation, since I perceive thee already
exposed to a more rigorous Penance, than that which my Charity would have
suffered my Justice to impose upon thee: For what mischief could I have
imagined (though I had been informed with the Soul of Phalaris his inginer)
equal to the Malice of this which thou have already incurred? in the one thou
learnest nothing but to speak Baudy with a good Grace, in the other nothing
but to blow a horn; Here thou suckest in the Principles of Atheism, there of
Ignorance; Here thou art instructed to Preach in an Epistle, there to Court thy
Friend in a Sermon: This stuffs thy Memory with Stolen French, that with
English not worth the Stealing: The one Commands thee to Violate the Laws of
all Ancient Rhetorique, the other to observe none. The one will give thee Rules
how to speak Balzaac, (or) badly, the other like a Post (id est) nothing at all.

The Consideration of this (Loving, Kind, Courteous Reader) did much
precipitate my Vindication of the Times from Error; or (as the Pure He Is and
She Is of this Age say,) did even force my Spirit to reclaim the Idolatrous
from adoring that Malicious Idol the English Secretary, that Image which
Nebuchadnezzar the King had set up, the Post with a Packet of Letters, and that
most abominable Baal, Balzaac: by divulging this Piece of Excellent
Workmanship, (which the Gods themselves did hammer and frame in the Head of
Monsieur La Serre;) by letting this Bird of Paradise fly out of her Cage, that
she might recreate Mortality with the Charms of her Voice, and resuscitate the
Intombed Spirits of Men, from that Leaden sleep which the former Tarantulaes
had thrown them into. Or as with most reason I may aver, by Publishing this
new Ephimerides to the World, which shall teach thee to know the Conjunctions
of the Planets, or erring Stars; I mean the Connection of Wandering words and
sentences, used, and abused by Men of all sorts ad Libitum. It will teach thee
the rising and setting of the Sun, or Elevation and depression of Periods; The
Ecclipses in writing, as to distinguish amongst sounds, and to know when one
obscures another, or at least renders it less agreeable. But if thou be not
yet Contented with this moderate touch of knowledge, it shall proceed farther,
and open to thee a sluse of all other sublunary Sciences whatsoever. Where
can thou have better Philosophy than here, where it teaches thee how the
rude Matter of an Epistle is to be informed with the spritefull Vivacity of
Phrases, and Apt Coherence of Periods? Where will thou prove an Arithmetitian,
if not here, where thou art taught, that if thou add, or subtract but one word
from the whole Number of an Epistle, thy Computation will prove false, and it
utterly lose the Grace and Sweetness due unto it? If thou would be
instructed in the Tacticks, where will thou learn a more exact way of ordering
Men and disposing a Battle than here, where one displaced, puts all the rest
out of order? Humanity cannot invent a more compendious way of Short writing,
since Stenography has here arrived to such Perfection, that when a Man has but
writ his Name, he has both Courted his Mistress, Comforted the Sick, Defied
an Enemy, and Obliged a Friend. Logic I am sure, is here in her Auge, since
our Syllogismes are so powerful, that except a Man would confess himself
rude, and unreasonable, (and consequently no Man) he can never deny the
Argument. What Rhetoric is more pleasing than this, where servants and
Admirers are acquired in every page? What Music more Harmonious than where we
are so rigorous in teaching the true art of stopps, that when one only is
escaped, the whole Air is nothing but a Discord? I must confess, our Grammar
is an Antipode to Lilly (though Infinitely more Complete,) for we do not
decline Words, but only Obsolecies, and Barbarismes: nor have we more than two
Conjugations, viz. to do you service, and to revenge my self; by which we
Conjugate all our other Verbs and Nouns be they what they will.

Behold Reader, beyond thy Expectation, another Ars magna et Ultima, besides
the Lullian; another Panace or Curer of all Deseases beside the Grecian; and
another Castle of Knowledge beside Records Sphere; which if thou accept with a
Willing mind, and good Intention, I Will deifie thee; but if thou attempt upon it
with unwashed hands, or a Prejudicated Opinion, I defy thee; and so fare thee
well.

Thy Servant, J. M.

THE FIRST LETTERS OF COMPLEMENT.
SIR,
I Take such delight in rendering you my service, that I remain always the
first satisfied though I acquit my self And that which makes me so careful
in seeking Occasions, is, that you should not reproach me to have omitted any.
Yet in this Sir I do not implor^ your belief, desiring so to let you see by
Effects, rather then Words, that I am without Complement,

Sir Your most humble servant.

Another upon the same Subject.
SIR,
I Defy you to accuse me of neglect in the performance of my Duty, the passion
which I have to your Service being so violent, that it nourishes in me a
continual Care of seeking Opportunities to make it known. To the furtherance
of which, this Letter offered it self most happily, having charge to assure you
from my part, that of all the servants which your Merits have acquired you, I am

Sir The most humble and most faithful.

SIR,
I Am by so many obligations Yours, that the only want of Occasions to give
Testimony of it, breeds all my Discontents. Esteeming my self unfortunate in
nothing so much, as that the Passion which carries me to your Service, prooves
as unprofitable as extreme. Which forces me to have recourse to Entreaties,
beseeching you to honor me with your Commands, that (other means failing) my
obedience may oblige you to believe that I am

Sir Your most humble servant.

Another upon the same.
SIR,
I Must discharge my heart in telling you that I honor you more then all the
rest of the World. It Is true your desert imposed the necessity upon me, but it
did not give me the inclination: though I beseech you to believe that I was
very willing in the constraint, having suffered no other violence, then what my
Reason and Judgment offered me. You shall have daily new proofs by the
Continuation of my Duty, and by the Quality which I bear

Sir of Your most humble servant.

Another upon the same subject.
SIR,
IF you expect nothing but Complements from me, you shall never receive any, I
am a Sworn enemy of Courtship and Civility toward persons whom I honor
extremely, as I do you. It sufficing me that I perform my Duty in their
behalf, and that I take care to do it with a good Grace. This is the Study in
which I practice my self, and I beseech you think that I will not loose the
least occasion to witness it to you, because I find my self much interessed
in the Resolution which I have taken, to be all my life

Sir Your most humble servant.

Another upon the same.
SIR,
THough I have told you a thousand times by word of Mouth that I am your
Servant, yet my Pen shall once aga^ne assure you of the sam^, expecting till
you oblige me, to more Eminent proofs; which I conjure you do to, and (if you
be pleased) to prevent the occasion by some Command, that may satisfy my
Impatience, to make you know and confess at the same time, that you may have
more powerful, and more considerable Servants, but never

Sir A more humble, or more faithful.

Answers to the Letters of Complement.
SIR,
I Never made doubt of your Civility and Courtesy, but of my own good
fortune, in meeting with the means to require them. Yet I entreat you to
believe, that hereafter I will employ all my cares to witness unto you my good
affection, and if Ill means render them unprofitable, I will dye for my own
satisfaction,

Sir Your very humble Servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Esteem to much the Honor of your Remembrance, not to desire the
continuation, and withal to beseech you for some Employment, wherein I may
witness the Passion which I have to your service. For which I will importune
you hereafter, desiring by deeds rather then words to let you see, that I am
extremely,

Sir Your most affectionate servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
THough this in some sort requite the favor of your remembrance, yet I cannot
cease to be indebted to you, when I consider, that your courtesy prevented my
respects; But I beseech you imagine, that for the Time to come, I will be so
careful to disingage my self, that you shall have greater cause to complain
of my importunity, then my silence: which I have resolved never to keep, when
your Interests oblige me to the contrary, as making Public Profession to
appear in all places

Sir Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Will be so presumptuous (since you desire it) as to believe you love me; but
upon condition, that you will likewise acknowledge the Passion, which I have to
serve you. For as it only makes me merit the honor of your Friendship, so I
shall be very glad, that you would everlastingly conserve the Remembrance of
it. Continue then in loving me as much as you please, and likewise esteem
infallibly that I am, more then all the world besides,

Sir Your most humble Servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
THough I give you very humble thanks for the Honor of your Remembrance, yet I
shall always remain Indebted to you, as making more account of the least of
your favors, then all the respects I am able to render you. Continue only in
obliging me of that fashion (though I be entirely yours already) and believe
(if you please) that I shall never be capable of other resentment, then which
shall witness the quality that I bear

Sir of Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Am not so unfortunate as I thought I was, since I hold some place still in
your Memory. Yet the Grief which I have, not to deserve this honor, has
reduced my thoughts, to such a Moderation, that I am in doubt whether I should
complain or rejoice I r^maines in you only to allay the discontent of my
Mind, by giving me some Employment in your service, which may witness the
Passion I have to maintain the Quality

Sir of Your very humble Servant.

Letters to complain of a Long Silence.
SIR,
THe Friendship and Service which heretofore I vowed you, force me at this
present, to demand the Reason of your Silence. I do not doubt but allege a
sufficient excuse to authorize it, yet I beseech you think, that how lawful
soever it be, I shall never leave off Complaining: you may pretend the want of
Occasions, or the sudden Accident of some Sickness, (which never molested you
except in thought) whereby to Justify your self against my Reproaches. But
all this is not able to satisfy me, confess your fault; ask forgiveness,
and you go a nearer way to work, that is the only way to conserve eternally,

Sir Your very humble servant.

Another upon the same.
SIR,
I Shall break with you at last, if you break not silence, imagining that you
love me but a little, since you have forgot me altogether. I beseech you deal
more familiarly with me, if my friendship be any way considerable, or you
esteem me worthy of yours. In the Humor I am now, I think you can no sooner
blot me out of your Memory, then I can raze you out of my heart, without
retaining any thing (by my good will) but the Quality only,

Sir of Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
IF you have taken an oath to write no more to me, at least send me the
letters back again which I addressed to you, that I may still have the honor
to receive something from your part. Silence is a sworn enemy of Friendship,
which is the reason that mine reproaches you at this present, being not able to
endure, that after so many protestations never to forget me, you should loose
even the Memory of having made them. You may change your Humor when you
please, if you desire to renew the obligations

Sir of Your most humble Servant,

Another.
SIR,
IF I did not honor you extremely, I could easily revenge my self of your
forgetfulness, by my silence; but the esteem which I make of your deserts,
together with an inclination which carries me to your service, oblige me to
assure you still, that though you should forget me, even to my name, I would
never change the Resolution which I have taken, to be all my life

Sir Your most humble servant, M.

Another.
SIR,
I Can endure no longer that you should forget a Person who honors you so
extremely as I do. These three Months of your silence I have kept my mind in
the continual fetters of grief, that I should loose the honor of your
Remembrance; I beseech you do me Justice, and let not all the World complain
with me, of the little esteem you make

Sir of Your most humble Servant.

Another.
SIR,
Do if you please, write no more to me, your merit constraines me to use you
in another fashion. I can never weary my self, in executing your Commands, and
less in acquitting my self when Occasions are offered, yet I do not desire
that you should esteem your self obliged to me, for I satisfy my self
always the first, following my inclination after I have honored your virtue,
because equally both the one and the other force me to carry, to my Grave, the
Quality

Sir of Your most humble Servant.

Answers to the Letter Complaining of Silence.
SIR,
YOu oblige me with such a good Grace, in Complaining of me, that I am
constrained to give you thanks instead of reproaches. It Is not because I want
lawful excuses to authorize my Silence. But the Interest which you take in it,
makes me to condemn it, assuring you, that hereafter you shall accuse me of
Importunity rather then neglect. It Is the Protestation

Sir of Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
IT is not needful to excuse my silence, since I still endure the Pain of it;
by reason of a Sickness, which molests me continually. But though your
Reproaches proceed from your Affection, yet I assure you they Interesse mine
extremely, being you doubt of the continuance of it. I beseech you think,
that I am not of an humor to forget those whom I honor as I do you, and that
except I be again reduced to the extremity I was in before, I shall always
acquit my self of that which I owe you, In Quality

Sir of Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
IF our reciprocal friendship could not be conserved but by letters, my hand
should be always upon the Paper, to give you continually some new assurance
or other; But knowing that she subsists of herself, through her own solidity,
I contemn all the Paintings of Civility and Complement. How little knowledge
soever you have of your own Desert, or my Humor, you may easily know without
being a Prophet the dear esteem I make of you, and being knowledge has truth
for her object, you are forced to believe that I am really

Sir Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
YOur Complaints and Reproaches, are too agreeable to me, that I am forced to
give you thanks, knowing they proceed from an excess of affection, and zeal.
It Is true I have been silent too long, but I pray you believe, that the
Misfortune which Imposed it upon me, has given me such a Penance, that I
deserve Pardon, though it were the most enormious crime of the World. I will
not now make a particular recital of all the Accidents which have befallen me,
for fear you should Judge me as Importune in that, as in the other you
esteemed me negligent: It suffices me to put you in mind, that I am always,
what I always was,

Sir Your most humble Servant.

Another Answer.
SIR.
YOU are too Just to Condemn me without hearing me speak. It Is true I have
been somewhat too long in acquitting, by the ordinary Commerce of Letters the
debt which I owe you, but the Mischance of the Prison where I am still, can
tell you, that though my hands be free, yet their liberty is altogether
unprofitable to serve them in that which you desire. Content your self then
(if you please) with the services I am able to render you, that is, in good
will and thought: without accounting this for one, since it is both by hazard and
an excess of good Fortune, that I acquit my self of it. And believe
assuredly, that into what extremity of adverse fortune soever I am reduced, I
will always conserve the passion I have to your Service, as being without
Fiction

Sir Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Would I were lest handed, that I might acquit my self of the Service I owe
you, being unfortunately lame of the right hand: which has obliged me to make
use of a strange Pen, to excuse my silence, and to assure you, that though I
serve my self of another man's endeavor in writing this Letter, yet it is my
soul that conceived it, and my heart that gave the Dictamen, being very glad
to witness unto you the Truth of my thoughts, touching the Resolution which I
have taken to make my self remarqued in all places

Sir Your most humble servant.

Letters of Thanksgiving.
SIR,
SInce it is your pleasure to add daily to the obligations of those who are
most entirely yours; I am resolved to let you take your course, and busy my
thoughts only in seeking occasions to revenge my self. And if my misfortune
in this Pursuit continually render my cares unprofitable, yet for your
satisfaction I shall always have a good Will, and Passion to do you Service,
which I shall heartily offer you up being

Sir Your most humble servant.

Another upon the same.
SIR,
I Do not intend that these thanks which I give you for the favor wherewith
you were pleased to honor me, should pass in your opinion for an
Acknowledgement: I revenge my self only of your Civility, expecting to meet
with an occasion, wherein I may witness with Services rather then Words, that
I am unfaignedly in heart, and soul

Sir Your very humble servant.

Another upon the same.
SIR,
I Confess you have obliged me with a very good Grace, and so perfectly, that
I shall remain indebted to you all my life. I would to God some Occasion would
offer it self, which I might employ in your Service, thereby to witness, that
as your favors have been extreme, I will attempt all extreamities to revenge
my self. Those are no discourses of Complement, my heart dictates to my Pen,
all that my Pen writes to you, with assurance that I will not long
unprofitably bear the Quality

Sir of Your very humble servant.

Another.
SIR,
I Know not in what Terms, to give you Thanks, for the Favors which your
Generous disposition has been pleased to be stow upon me. I am so unfortunate
an Orator, that I am out of all hope to acquit my self, that way. It suffices
me, to put you in mind of the Passion which I have to your Service, persuading
my self, that the remembrance it will excitate in you shall supplicate for the
default of my Capacity, and that Considering the Ardor of my Zeal, rather then
the beauty of my Discourse, you will content your self with my Disability, and
that I assure you once again, how perfectly I am,

Sir Your very humble servant.

Another upon the same.
SIR,
IF I had been more happy or more powerful, I had already requited your
favors instead of giving you thanks; but being unfortunate as I am, and in
such a degree of Impotency, I have nothing left but words, to send you, as an
acknowledgement of your Deeds. It Is true, they are words most infallibly true,
assuring you from my heart rather then my mouth, that I will carry to my Grave,
the Quality

Sir of Your most humble servant.

Another.
SIR,
IF you expect Thanks worthy your favors, you shall never receive any of me. I
am far more fit to publish them, then requite them in the least respect, if
the good desire I have to disingage my self, do not pass for satisfaction:
which is all that I can offer you in the state I find my self at this
present, beseeching you to believe, that if I were not oppressed with an
extreme Misfortune, my Care and Pains should soon witness the Occasion
which is offered me, to give Testimony how much I am

Sir Your most humble servant, M.

Answers to the Letters of Thanksgiving.
SIR,
YOur thanks have bought my service at so dear a rate, that the satisfaction
which before I received is utterly now taken from me. Keep your ^omplements
then for some other, and remember to use more familiarly,

Sir The most humble of all your servants.

Another Answer.
SIR,
THere is far more Honor, then Content in serving you, since by such ready
acknowledgements, you hasten the satisfaction. The excess of your Nobleness,
undoes me, not being able to endure thanks for the performance of my duty, and
therefore since my endeavors in your behalf can be styled no other, I
beseech you to vary your Terms, and to Consider me always in the Quality I am

Sir of Your most humble servant,

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Complain much of the Excess of your Civility and Courtship, since our
Reciprocal friendship is therein greatly Interessed. you give me Thanks for
the service which you desired of me, as though I were not obliged to it of
Necessity. Leave off that ill Custom if you Please, and know that the Language
of Complements is unknown to true friends, whereof I am one, and which is more,

Sir Your most humble Servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
YOur Complements have put me into a very ill humor; I cannot write to you,
but in Choler, since you use me as a stranger, like as app^ares by the
superfluity of your Ceremonies and unprofitable Thanks. It seems you have
wholly forgot the absolute power that your Merit has obtained over me, which
causes me once again to put you in mind, that you will be sooner weary in
Commanding, then I in executing, as being unreservedly,

Sir Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Send you back your Thanks, to the End that you may make use of them, when
you entertain some person less endeared to your service then I am. One would
think by reading your complements, that you Cog with me to gain my
Friendship. I pray Remember Sir, that I have wholly dedicated it to your
desert, and therefore, you are obliged hereafter to treat me with less
Civility, and more freedom, if you account me into the number of your
Servants, I being,

Sir One of your most humble, and most faithful

Another Answer.
SIR,
YOur thanks have made me resolve to do that piece of Service over again,
Imagining that something was omitted, since you go about to put me in mind
of it, by your unnecessary Acknowledgment. Sir you know that kind of
affectation is always ill received in the familiar Commerce, of a true
friendship, which I shall always profess in your behalf, and likewise that I
am,

Sir Your most humble Servant.

Letters of Entreaty.
SIR,
THe Report of your generous Disposition gives me the boldness, to implore
your favor in the dispatch of a business, whose success depends absolutely
on your Authority. It Is true I have not the Honor to be known by you, but
that being a particular Mi^fortune of Mine, I desire it may not serve as a
pretense to the Refusal of my Demand: Assuring you, that I shall endeavor to
make known by re-all service, rather then name,

Sir Your most humble Servant, M.

SIR,
I Could wish your Command had prevented my Entreaties, that my observance
might have merited of you the dispatch of a business which presents it self.
But being the occasion to Importune you, was offered, when I sought one to do
you service, I will force my self to believe that my good will may oblige you,
not to refuse this courtesy

Sir to Your most humble servant.

SIR,
MY vowed Service and Friendship, give me the freedom to Implore your favor,
in behalf of the Bearer of these Presents, I serve my self very boldly of the
Power you have given me to employ your Endeavors in all sorts of encounters,
but upon Condition that you will do the same in all occasions that may offer
themselves, wherein I may witness how much I am,

SIR,
IF you make as great Account of my Entreaty, as I do of your commands, you
will easily accord unto me this, which is, to sustain with your Authority, a
business of Mine now in agitation, that it may be determined to my advantage.
I do not doubt of your Power, and less of your Nobleness, which forces me to
believe that you will comply with this Occasion offered you, to oblige
extremely,

Another.
SIR,
IF you complain of my Importunity, accuse your own freeness, for if you had
been less Generous, I had bin less bold. But being I know by Experience in
what a high degree Civility and Courtesy predominate in you, I am constrained
to think, that my entreaty will not be inacceptable, which is, that you would
be pleased to mollify with your Eloquence, that harsh conceit that Master N.
has of me. In this encounter you will oblige us both together, since giving
him to understand my Innocence, he will easily give place to reason. This
favor in particular I hope from your Goodness, as you on the contrary may
expect all sorts of Service from my Duty: In Quality

SIR,
THough I be the most unprofitable of all your friends, yet I shall never
fail to prove my self one of the most passionate to your Service. The
violence whereof causes me at this Present, to entreat you to oblige me in
such, or such an Encounter. All that I can say to you for the first
acknowledgement is, that I shall conserve Eternally the Memory of this favor,
and if I be not able to meet with an Occasion to revenge my self, that I shall
carry the Sorrow of it into my Grave, together with the Quality

SIR,
I Have done all that you desired of me, but with so much satisfaction, and so
little Pains, that I beseech you prepare some new commands, whereby the
passion I have to serve you, may not be left unprofitable, and you shall see by
my observance, that I have no greater Pleasure in the World, then to make my
self remarqued in all places,

Sir Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Have many thanks to return you for the happy employment you gave me in
your service; I think all things fell out according to your desire, which gave
me ample occasion to rejoice, as participating in all things that concern
your particular. I beseech you do me the favor, that I may never have
occasion to doubt of it, since I profess my self as much as any man in the
World,

Sir Your most humble servant. M.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Could wish you had every day occasion to command my service, that I might
continually have the Good fortune to produce new proofs of my obedience. I
performed happily the last Commands wherewith you were pleased to honor me,
which gives me cause to believe that you will not long let me rest
unprofitable, without giving me some other sort of employment, wherein I may
find more satisfaction, as prooving it more painful. This I beseech you to
do, in quality

Sir of Your most humble Servant, M.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Find so much facility in the execution of the Command, which you imposed
upon me, that I am ashamed to reckon it in the number of services which I
desire to render you: It being an Encounter of so little Importance, for my
satisfaction and your Interest, that I beseech you give me some other
Employment, wherein I may witness according to your Merit and my Affection how
unfaignedly I am

Sir Your most humble Servant. M.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Ask you pardon for the long time that I have spent in the executing your
Commands, not that I have been negligent in employing my Cares, and Diligence,
but because the success consisting in a Strangers power, I could no sooner
give you the Effects: yet let not the mishap of this delay, hinder you
hereafter in using my Endeavors, since I am without reserve

Sir Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
WHen you desire any service of me, I beseech you consider whether it be in my
power or no, to the end that being unable to execute your Commands (as I am at
this Present) I incur not the hazard of your reproach. You may Expect new
proof (when you please) of the Passion which I have to serve you, since I no
way desire to bear in vain the Quality

I Am more sorry then your self, that I am not able to effect your Commands:
The duty which you expect, does not absolutely depend of me, so that to render
it worthily, I am to implore the favor of an other Man, who professes to
incline totally to the adverse party. Do not think that I make these excuses
to avoid the occasion, which presented it self for your service, but believe I
beseech you, that in all other Encounters, I will Comport my self with so much
passion, that you shall be forced to confess I am unfaignedly,

Sir Your most humble servant, M.

Another Answer.
SIR,
IF you knew in what disorder my Misfortune causes me to write, (since I am not
able to satisfy your desire) you would have pity on my Affliction, being it
wholly proceeds from my Grief, that the Power to do you service is taken from
me. I speak this from my heart, and soul, and being the friendship I
promised you taught me the Language, I will constrain my self to believe,
that it is Eloquent enough to persuade you, that the only want of ability,
deprives me at this Present, of the Honor and Contentment, to witness unto
you how much I am

Congratulatory Letters to a friend, of some Good Fortune happened to Him.
SIR,
IF you knew how excessively joyful I was at the News of your good fortune,
you would make a doubt whether your own resentment might be equalled to mine
or no: truly Sir there could nothing be added to it, and besides it proceeds
wholly from the friendship that long ago I vowed to your good nature, which is
not vulgar, since it has your desert for the Object. I could say more if the
Excess of my Gladness would give me the freedom, wherefore for the Present I
must suffice my self, that you remain assured, how the Contentment which I
take can be equalled by nothing but the passion which I have to your service,
as being

Sir Your very humble servant.

Another.
SIR,
THe news of your Promotion into that Charg, which you wished for so long,
have added such Contentment and Satisfaction to my thoughts, that I am able to
express but one part of the Joy which reigns in me. I trouble not my self,
to persuade you to it by a long discourse; your own merit and our reciprocal
Friendship, (supplying the defect of my Eloquence) will give a far better
Testimony then my pen is able, which has in charge at this present only to put
you in mind, that I am always according to my wont

Sir Your most humble Servant.

Another upon the same.
SIR,
THe part which I always took in your Interests, shall witness unto you at
this Present, the excess of my joy which I conceived at the news of your Good
Fortune: and though I be not one of the first to congratulate it with you, yet
I am one of the most sensible, in the common Contentment which possesses the
World. The diligence, or delay of a Post can advance, or diminish no man's duty
in this kind of encounter, since nothing but Zeal, and Affection are
considerable, which gives me great confidence at this Present, as being more
then any man in the world,

Sir Your most humble Servant.

Another.
SIR,
Do not admire that I am one of the last, who congratulate with you, your good
fortune: the joy which I conceived was so extreme, that it could afford me no
sooner the Liberty to acquit my self. I know, the most o^ your friends have
prevented me, but being their satisfaction is small, I do not wonder if their
diligence be the greater. As for my part my idleness increases my Merit,
since the stay and Protraction proceeded only from the excess of the Gladness

Sir of Your most humble servant.

Another.
SIR,
SInce you doubt not the Friendship which I have promised you, you will easily
believe, that I was extreme sensible of the Good fortune which happened you of
late, but I must tell you, that as your merit made me foresee it in you long
before it came, so I was not much astonished at the first recital. I wish you
daily the like, or greater advancements, being unable to acquit my self
otherwise then by prayers of the great debt I owe you. Yet how unfortunate or
unprofitable soever I be, do not cease to continue me in the Number

Sir of Your most obedient and faithful servants, M.

Another.
SIR,
YOu must imagine if you please, the resentment which the News of your Good
Fortune imprinted in me, since I am not able to express it as it is in it
self. But if in this you have need of any succor, your Memory may assist you
by putting you in Mind, of the Passion which I have for your Service; it is
that only which caused the excess of my Joy, and to which you can add
nothing, but by honoring me with your Commands, since by that means my
Obedience may give me, the perfect Contentment of being able to testify unto
you how much I am

Sir Your most humble servant, and most faithful.

Answers to the Letters of Congratulation.
SIR,
I Always believed you were so Generous, as to take part in whatsoever should
concern me, having begun so strict a Commerce of Reciprocal Friendship. And I
persuade my self likewise, that you make no doubt of the Passion which I have
to do you service (by which Means only I am able to Merit the Effects of
your Nobleness.) Whereof you may be as Confident, as of the most assured
thing in the World, since I am in heart, and soul,

Sir Your most humble servant, M.

Another Answer.
SIR,
SInce you take part in the good fortune which has befalne me, you must also
participate in the advantage of the new Credit which it has brought me into.
This I advertise you of, to the End that you let not any occasion slip, wherein
you may procure new proofs of my Passion, nor forget this advice which I give
you; since I shall dye of Impatience, if I expect long, the opportunity to
witness unto you, how deeply I am

Sir Your Servant, and Friend, M.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Am not to thank you for these new proofs of your Nobleness which you have
shown in my behalf, because they are actions so proper to your Nature, that
without them you could not possibly live. I must give you praises then, instead
of thanks, and account my self happy, that I serve as an object, to your
virtuous Inclinations, whereof I should become Envious, but that they do not
admit any hopes of Imitation: and therefore I reserve admiration only to
contemplate them, in Quality

Sir, of Your most humble Servant. M.

Another.
SIR,
THe new assurances which you have given me of your friendship in bearing part of
my good fortune, have yielded me much more satisfaction then my advancement it
self, as preferring the Happiness of your Affection before my own particular;
you have touched me so sensibly, in mingling my interests with your own, that I
shall never loose the Remembrance of so great a favor: wishing that some
occasion would offer it self whereby I might in some part merit it by the
reality of my Service, since I am, and will be, all my life,

Sir, Your very humble servant. M.

Another Answer.
SIR,
YOu seem to take pleasure in nothing else, but in giving me daily new proofs
of your friendship, as if I were able to conceive any doubt of it at all. I
know that you could not be so noble as you are, except you took part in the
Content which I receive, for the happy success, of my affair. And besides
making Profession to love me, in that height as I honor you, I know there was
necessity for your satisfaction, and that you should be extremely sensible of
the good fortune,

Sir of Your most humble Servant, M.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Began not to day to be indebted to you for the free Testimonies of your
friendship, having given me so many proofs, that the disability to revenge my
self, has made me ashamed of the Remembrance. But since you partake of the joy
which I receive for the gaining of my suit, I conjure you to serve your self
without exception, of all the Advantages which I have got, if you would really
have me believe, that you account me of the number of your best friends as well

Sir as of Your most humble and most faithful servants.

Congratulatory Letters to a Person of Eminent Quality.
MY LORD,
THough I be one of the last in Congratulating with your Lordship the New
government which the king has bestowed upon you; yet I can assure your
Lordship, that no Man forewent me in witnessing the Resentment of so public a
Joy. And as this duty which I render you is valuable according to the
greatness of my Zeal, and not of my Diligence, so I thought that though it
came something late, it would not be less Considerable. If I had had no other
object but your Lordships good Fortune, I had prevented in this actio^, all
that have now got the start of me; but taking nothing into my Consideration,
except your Desert and my Inclination to your service, I gave way to my own
desires rather then Custom, which is to make my self remarked every where in
effect, rather than appearance,

My Lord,
I Could not be silent in the Acclamations of such an universal Gladness,
being forced to join my voice, to other Men's, in Publishing our Commune
Contentment touching the Mareschalship of France, wherewith the King has been
graciously pleased to honor you; This Action of Justice is so highly approved
by every Person, that your Enemies are constrained to condemn themselves to an
everlasting silence, being not able to open their Mouths, but to their own
Confusion. Live then happily with this part of Good fortune which your merit
first made you aspire to, and believe assuredly, that in the whole train of
your Excellencies servants, there shall be very few able to imitate me, in the
resolution which I have taken, to carry to my grave, the Quality

Letters to a Person of Note, acknowledging some notable favor received.
My Lord,
I Do not render you this duty as thanks, for the favors which your Goodness
has been pleased to heap upon me, since their excess force me to a silence,
as taking from me all means to revenge my self. It suffices me you believe,
that I will sooner loose my self, then the remembrance of your bounty. I know
your Lordship satisfied your self first, every time you obliged me; but being
I cannot do so, what advantage soever I take, without rendering you some
service of consideration, I humbly beseech your Lordship to grant me the
Liberty to Importune you at all times to honor me with your Commands, to the
End that by the Innocncy of my observance, you may be constraind to know, that
if you be extremely generous, I am no less sensible, nor no less,

MY LORD,
IF you expect thanks worthy of the Favors wherewith you have been pleased to
honor me, I humbly beseech your Lordship to afford me the terms that I may
repeat them after you for your satisfaction. I confess boldly my incapacity to
express unto your Lordship the resentment which your obligations cause in me,
as well as my disability in meeting with occasions to acquit my self. But
being Generous actions carry their own recompense along with them, all that I
can do, is to put your Lordship continually in mind of your Nobleness, and
to publish it in all Corners of the World, together with the Quality

Letters to ask Pardon for a Fault Committed.
SIR,
IF the confession of my fault, can merit any Grace, I will expect it from your
Bounty, not my Intention, because it is Innocent. It Is true I have lost your
good Affection by reason of the Passage last night, but since I was surprised
by an extremity of Anger, (which would not suffer me to consider where I was)
I leave the Judgment of my weakness to you, having wholly condemned it my
self. You know that our first motions are so sovereign in their violence,
that in contempt of reason they will undergo no laws but their own; who
should obtain of you to consider that in the fault which I have committed,
there was more contributed by nature, then my own free will; so that I knew not
how to avoid it, I know at least how to repent my self, of which I assure you
most faithfully to the end, that my most humble entreaties for your pardon and
favor, may be made more acceptable, and the rather because they proceed,

Sir, from Your most humble servant. M.

Another.
SIR,
I Have too great an opinion of your Piety to make doubt of the Pardon which I
crave, for my fault committed last night, it is not that I fear the Innocence
of my Intention is not able to justify me, but because I would set my Mind in
quiet, as I have already my Conscience. This act of acknowledgement should
serve you for a satisfaction, as it does me for a Penance: putting you in
mind of the Passion which always heretofore I have had to do you service,
and of the Profession which I have made, to bear in all places, the Quality,

Letters Reproaching a friend for the Coldness of his Affection.
SIR,
IF I made not an extreme account of your friendship, I would not have
complained of your silence, nor that Coldness which you showed at our last
meeting. I speak not this, because I would force your Love: but I should be
very glad you would acknowledge the Affection which I have vowed you, whereby
you might be obliged to do me justice in honoring me with the like, yet I
leave you the liberty to do as you please, against my will, I say against my
will, because I have taken Oath, to live and dye

Sir Your most humble Servant, M.

Another.
SIR,
I Am constrained to put you in mind of those protestations of friendship
which once you made me, being I perceive that yours grows already weary of
her wonted Constancy. You seem to have forgot at the same time, both the
esteem which I make of your Desert, and the Passion which I have to your
service. Sir you may change your humor when you please, if you would have me
believe you are not fickle in your Promises, and that you know the Art to
Conserve eternally, those that Endeare themselves the most to you, as I do, In

It Is told me that you maintained a Certain discourse to my disadvantage, I

constrain you to a more rigorous Penance, I understand not Jesting, if I
begin it not my self, wherefore correct your Pleadings, or I will cause you to
loose both your suit and charges. I give you this fair warning that you may
have less cause to complain hereafter, and when I shall perceive you in as

I ought to be for the time to come, as hitherto I have been

Sir Your most humble servant. M.

Another upon the same.
SIR,
I Understand that when you have nothing else to do, you take upon you to
backbite, a Person very near allied unto me. It Is the worst trade and most
dangerous that you can employ your self in: but if your wine be the cause of
these extravagancies, I advise you to mingle it with water as soon as you can,
otherwise I shall be constrained to force you to such a long silence, that no
man shall ever hear you speak hereafter. It Is the Charitable advise, if you
follow it,

Answers to the Letters of Complaint.
SIR,
I Do not write this letter to give you satisfaction, but to comply with my
own Humor, in the Innocence I have always lived; you are too blame to make
those false reporters, my Judges, from whose sentence I appeal as from an
abuse, yet you may believe what you please, being you are unwilling to
explicate your self any further. And if you be not satisfied with the
Assurance I give, that I never dreamed of offending you, I leave you to fair
Paper and Ink, whereby you may signify unto me your mind, and Intention,
whether good or bad I care not. It suffices me, that you call to remembrance
the Name and Quality which I once bore

SIR,
THose that told you I abused your kinswoman abuse me, I know (without any Man's
Intimation) the respect I owe to that sex: and what subject soever she had
given me, my reason should always have forced me to hold my Peace. As for the
rest, know that wine never made me speak, and if you be so foolish as to
believe it, I know a way to punish your folly, I tell you what I mean to do,
that you may have no pretense to say I surprise you unawares, at our next
meeting, where I have good hope to make you feel how worthily I can Chastize,

Letters to Justify ones self of a Reproach.
SIR,
I Wonder greatly at the injustice you have done me, being otherwise so
reasonable as you are: you have condemned me upon the first report of my
Enemies, without observing any other Formality then what your passion
suggested. I must tell you, you appear something too violent in this
Encounter, and the more, because you never seemed to make doubt of the passion
I had to serve you; I complain then with reason, because your Reproaches are
without reason, and beseech you take the Pains hereafter to ponder the
informations which shall be made you of a business so Important as this, and
particularly when it touches the Interest

SIR,
I Do so highly approve of your Judgment, that I begin to question my
Innocence, since it has declared her culpable: yet I must assure you, with your
Permission, that my Thoughts did never contribute any thing to the fault
whereof you accuse me, and likewise condemn me, without hearing me speak.

me reason, yet my conscience should always, that I may rest in Quiet, and
peaceably possess the Quality

Letters complaining of the Absence of a Friend.
SIR,
THough true friendship be in the Proof of absence, yet yours is of so long
continuance, that I imagine you purpose to cast me off, since you seem to
retire your affection thus by little and little. I speak confidently, because

mention. You must not give so much way to your humor, and inclination, that
they interesse with them the Contentment, of all that love you. For my own

Answers to the Letters which complain of Absence.
SIR,
YOu chide me with such a good grace, that I could wish to see you oftener in
that humor, since it obliges me to believe that I am not altogether indifferent
to you. It Is true, my absence has been something long, but being my presence
is unprofitable to my friends, by the disability I am in to serve them, I make
the less account of my absence from the Court; Yet the only means to occasion
my return, will be, if you testify unto me that I can be useful to you when I
am there; which shall precipitate my haste, being in a firm resolution to
render you all manner of Service, in quality

Letters to clear our selfs of a false report.
SIR,
I Need not much eloquence to persuade my innocence touching the report which
was made to you of late, since I will oblige my self to make them confess the
truth publicly that have been too shameless to maintain the contrary in
private. It Is a malice so ill contrived, (though black as Hell) that I am
persuaded it will deceive it self. For what appearance is there, that having
received an infinity of favor from your goodness, I should so irreverently
contemn a thousand other noble qualities that elevate your esteem above the
common? I beseech you believe that I shall be their admirers all my life, and a
continual flaile to the broachers of this Imposture. I have no respect of
persons when my Honor is questioned; I bear a sword to defend it with the
hazard of my life, which I esteem far less. But if this cannot give you
satisfaction, let me know the name of the reporter, and I will make you sport
in laying open the particulars of his knavery, and the sincerity of my
innocence, which shall give you sufficient never to make doubt of the passion I
have to serve you, as being

and I Will engage my self to make him sign me an acquittance of my innocence with
his own blood. I boast of nothing that I will not do; for let me but know the

Answers to the Letter of Justification.
SIR,
It Is true, I was told you abused me behind my back; but since I never gave you
cause, and on the other side your discretion being sufficiently known to me, I
was not so much as tempted to give credit to it; you needed not then have
justified your self of a fault whereof I esteemed you always innocent. The

BEfore I can declare you guilty, you must confess your self faulty with your

Answers to the Letters written to a sick Friend.
SIR,
IF I had sooner recovered my health, I had sooner returned you thanks for the
resentment you wittnessed to have of my sickness: but being it kept me very
long, I was constrained to delay my acknowledgement till this very present:
though it is not from this encounter only that I know how sensible you are of
al things concerning your Friends, which makes you have them without number;
but I can assure you, that put them all together, I am

Letters to demand the protection of a strange Prince.
SIR,
THough I have not the honor to be known to your Highness, yet the esteem
that all the World makes of your Royal virtues, gave me the boldness most
humbly to beseech your Majesty to grant me protection within the Lands of your
Obedience. I am not guilty of any crime that should make me blush; and if I
have violated the Laws of my own Prince, it was but to obey the Law which
Honor had imposed upon me before. This makes me expect from your Highness
bounty, al manner of assistance, since only the profession of Soldier made me
quit my own Country. Your Highness will augment by this action the number of
your Creatures, since thereby I shall vow my self to live and dye in quality

THe Bruit of your Highness renown occasioned my entrance into the Lands of

I hope your Highness will not violate for me alone, the Laws which your
wisdom has already made in favor of distressed and guilty persons; and
though I be no otherwise than the right of Honor dos permit, yet I most humbly
implore your Majesty's protection as extremely conducing to my repose and
quiet. For my birth and condition, I thought it not necessary to reveal them,
till your Highness command oblige me to it, being sufficient to give you
assurance, that I have committed no crime whereof all men that make profession

Letters witnessing unto a Friend the contentment we receive in serving him.
SIR,
I Should express but one part of my Contentment, though I should say in doing
you service I receive all the satisfaction the World is able to afford; for
your merit is so considerable, that there is no divertisment like the
continual action of executing your commands. Do not think that I complement,
but believe infallibly that my heart, mouth, and pen, conspire together every
time I give you assurance, as I do now, that I am more than all the World.

Enviers, as well as of your Admirers, being Jealous of the continual
Generosity you exercise in my behalf, not leaving me so much leisure as to
ruminate upon the means of acknowledgement. It Is my turn now to let you know,
I am not insensible, and that if you be extremely well skilled in the Art of

THE SECOND PART OF The Secretary in Fashion.
A Letter Consolatory to a Father upon the Death of his Son.
SIR,
THE sorrowful news of your Sons Death, touched me very feelingly, and the
more, because I had the honor of his acquaintance, and particular knowledge of
his Deserts. The love which you have sustained, is very great I confess; but
you must likewise confess that unavoydable evils, are to be endured with
constancy. I speak not this to condemn your Sighs and Tears, for I do
willingly approve of them, yea, even in excess: but to let you know, that
after you have satisfied your humor, you must a little give place to reason,
being you shall receive as much glory in drying up your Tears, as you did once
pleasure in shedding them. I know your Son was the only Comfort which
remained to you in this World, and that his presence merely did make you live
contented even amongst the peevishnesses of old age. But all this induces me
to believe that God deprived you of him, for no other Reason, but only to
comfort you hereafter in himself, as being the only Good which is subject to
no Change. He calls himself a Jealous God; wonder not then if he be Jealous of
the unmeasureable love you bore to your Child. And if his Providence has
found a means to oblige you, in robbing you of an object which possessed all
your affections together, you on the other side are obliged this Day to make
him the object of your Thanksgiving, and not of your Complaints. This is that
which I expect at the hands of your Magnanimity, and soundness of Judgment;
the weakness of mine, detaining me from passing further, being assured that
you are able your self to be your own Comforter. It suffices me that I acquit
my self of my Duty, in witnessing to you the grief I conceive for your
Misfortune, and the continual care I shall have to blaze my self wheresoever
I come,

Sir, Your most humble servant.

The Answer.
SIR,
I Am obliged to you, for the charitable counsel you were pleased to give me
upon the Death of my Son: But suffer me to tell you (after my humble thanks)
that my affliction is of such a Nature, that Death only is able to give me
satisfaction, so that I find my self constrained to go seek my remedy in my
Grave; and yet I do not murmr against the providence of God; though I must
assure you that without a particular Grace, and sensible miracle, I shall faint
under the burden of my misfortune. Yet I beseech you Sir, do not deprive me
of the Comfor of your Letters, knowing I cannot enjoy the Happiness of your
Company: And above all things, remember me in your Prayers, since I expect no
succor but from Heaven. I am ever

Sir, Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
YOur dear Letter concerning the death of my Son, had much allayd my Grief,
if my affliction had been capable of any Comfort; Yet I esteem my self
extremely obliged to you for the part you seem to take in my Misfortune, in
which you testify that you are equally both of a Generous Disposition, and a
Good Friend. Sir, the sorrow which oppresses me, has left me nothing but
sighs and tears to offer you up in acknowledgement, it sufficeing me (since
it is true) that you believe I am and will be everlastingly

Sir, Your very humble servant.

Letters Consolatory to a Son, upon the Death of his Father.
SIR,
THad sooner condoled with you the loss of your Father, if I had sooner judged
you capable of Consolation. I thought it fit to afford you some time, to pay
(with the abundance of your Tears) the debt you owed to Nature; but now having
satisfied your self, by the public Testimony which you have given of your
Sorrow, I come amongst others, to acquit my self of my obligation, and to
persuade you to patience, assuring you that I am very sensible of the excess
of your Affliction. I know you have practiced that virtue in a thousand
Encounters of Misfortune, which have made you able to give lessons to all the
rest of the World; So that all I am to do, is to put you in mind, that both
you and I make all the haste possible after him whose absence we deplore with
too much Lamentation; and that without a particular Favor of God Almighty, we
shall be even at his heels, before we be worthily prepared for so great a
Voyage. This I made bold to remember you of, and likewise that I am, as much as
ever

Sir, Your most humble servant, M.

Another Letter.
It Is not to Comfort you of the loss which you have sustained, that I put Pen
to Paper, but rather to give Testimony of the Resentment which I feel, knowing
the Ability of your judgment, and weakness of my own. It suffices me to
represent unto you, that in the Necessity of dying or being born, Nature does
oblige every man to go the Way that is Marked out for him; It Is no matter how
long and strong some men be, they all meet together at the Grave, and being
arived there, none makes account of the Time which they employed in going that
Voyage. For our own particulars, let us consider how many years we have
already spent since we began it; and in this very Moment that you read this, we
may propose to our selves the End of it, by the Imagination of a hidden death.
As for your Father, he dyed but for himself, and has perhaps left you a while
to play his Part here in this World, which ought in my opinion to leave you
more Envy than Sorrow, knowing that he has already cast Anchor in that haven
whether you tend with might and maine. I would say more, if I made no
conscience to detain your Eyes too long upon this Paper; you must give them
yet a little time to sleep, since your Grief is just; in which I take a large
Part, in Quality

Sir, of Your most humble servant.

Another Letter.
SIR,
I Am too much your Servant, to remain Dumb, and Insensible, at the
sorrowful report of your Fathers death. These lines in acquitting me of what I
owe you, will testify unto you the Part I take in your affliction. I think it
will be hard for you to comfort your self after such a Loss; but since God
does never Afflict us above our force, let the force of your judgment work
your Consolation. The most sweet consideration you can have, is that you were
witness of the last actions which your Father did, before his retreat, out of
this World; which having either few or no examples, may be a sufficient cause
of your Quiet, every time you consider their importance. Live honestly as he
did, and dye in the same Manner; you are in the right way to the Place whither
he is gone: and if he have anticipated you some few days, those will seem but
a Moment, when you are arived at the End. Solace your self then in his
absence, since the innocence wherein you live, is an Infallible Assurance to
you that you shall see him very suddenly. I will give you like undoubted
Testimony of the Passion which I have to your Service, whenever you please to
honor me with your Commands, as being

Sir, Your most humble servant.

Answers to the Letters of Consolation.
SIR,
I Do not excuse the Long time that I have staid in returning you thanks for
the part which you did me the Honor to take in my affliction; because the
Grief is still so sensible to me, that I cannot employ my Spirit without
Violence, in any other thoughts but those of my Misfortune: Not that I remain
not entirely Resigned to the Will of God, and fully Resolved to Patience: but
yet all this cannot hinder my Sorrow from Enjoying an absolute Possession of
me: and for an Increase of Mischief, my griefe-sick Humor does render it so
agreeable, that I have not so much Liberty as to Complain, though it devour me
by Little and Little. Yet I cease not to be extremely obliged to you, for your
Pious and Charitable Counsels, which you were pleased to give me, assureing
you that I will take my ordinary Lessons of Comfort out of them.
Notwithstanding, I must tell you with my ancient freedom, that as my Affliction
comes from above, it is from thence only that I expect a Remedy. How good a
Physician soever Time be, I desire nothing of you but Prayers, intermingled
with Commands; to the end that my obedience may make me worthy the good
opinion you have

Sir, of Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Must confess your Charitable letter did much comfort the loss which I
lately sustained; and the more, because it gave Testimony of your feeling in my
Affliction. In such accidents as these, I never find more Consolation, than to
see my self lamented by my Friends; amongst whom since you possess the first
rank, I leave to your own consideration whether your Letter were agreeable to
me, or no: Yet for all that, I cannot cease my Tears, my Sorrow increasing
upon me daily more and more, through the Remembrance of the Misfortune which
was the cause of it. And truly after this Loss, I cannot apprehend any other;
which might serve me for a very effectual admonishment, if I were Capable of
receiving any. I would say more, if my Tears did not blot out my Writing:
Wherefore in brief, I do desire of you, that you would be pleased to Conserve
me the Honor of your Remembrance, and add not the Loss of your Friendship to
this which I already sustain; since I am with Passion

Sir, Your most humble and most obliged servant.

Letters Consolatory to a Husband upon the Death of his Wife.
SIR,
I Know not in what Terms to begin to comfort you, your Loss appearing to
me so great, by reason of the excess of your Affliction, and my Resentment,
that I am far more disposed to accompany your tears, than able any way to
solace your Misery. You know Misfortune has taught me by Experience to value a
Discontent of that Nature, having heretofore shed tears for the same subject.
So that representing to my self that which I have suffered in a like
Encounter, I must needs tell you, you are not to expect your Remedy from any
Place but Heaven. Though I deny not but Time may work much upon that kind of
Malady; yet the Term is so long, that the little remainder of Quiet, which is
left after the Purge of our discontent, stays not so long as to give us an
absolute and full Possession of it. Wherefore be assured, that God will not
abandon you, if you adore his Providence with submission; a Means to which,
is, if you Consider that you are continually in Election to see your Wife
again, and sooner too than perhaps you imagine. Pardon me Sir, for my
freedom of speech; I cannot flatter you, being to that Point, as I am,

Sir, Your most humble servant.

Another.
SIR,
THough I be not able to Comfort you in your Wifes death, yet it is sufficient
for my satisfaction, that I witness unto you the great part which I take in your
Affliction: only I will put you in Mind, that in Sorrowful Accidents,
Patience is the chief Remedy, after our Resignation to the Will of God. Our
tears and Complaints are in vain, since they do but provoke Heaven, in stead
of appeasing it. When you espoused that virtuous Lady, the Notary who passed
the Contract of your Marriage, forgot not to insert this Clause, that the
survivor should enjoy the rights of Widdowship. What reason have you then, to
lament a Death which you foresaw so long since, as if you had been assured,
when you took her, she had not been subject to it? She prevented you in an
Inevitable Action; and perhaps it will not be much; Ten years more or less,
are but an instant to that of Death; For which I would wish you prepare your
self; what leisure soever you have, I can assure you you will have very little
spare time. But I must not incur the Fault from which I promised to exempt my
self. I ask you Pardon, since my Crime is occasioned by my Zeal, as being

SIR,
THe Friendship and service I vowed to you long ago, have made me so sensible
of the sorrowful News of your Wifes death, that I stand in need of the
Consolation which all the World does administer to you. Expect not then any
Comfort from me, being afflicted as I am. All that I can say to you, is, that
your Wife dying in that innocence, in which she always lived, has left you in
my Opinion a greater cause of Envy, than of Sorrow. Wherefore, I would not have
you Dream of any thing so much, as of following her; and since you are every
hour hastening to your end, change the Nature of your tears, lamenting more
that she has left you behind her, than that she is gone before you. This is all
the Counsel I can give you, together with a new assurance that I will live and
dye

Sir, Your most humble servant.

Answers to the Precedent Letters.
SIR,
THE Grief which I conceived for the loss of my Wife, would not permit me
sooner to render you thanks, for the pious resentment you witness in her
behalf. I always thought you would participate in my Misfortunes, because you
did me the Honor to love me: And the rather because I knew you were
interessed in my Sorrow, as having lost a most humble Servant. Yet I remain
indebted to you for the Charitable care which you took in comforting me,
though it were in vain, since I cannot so soon quit the memory of a Loss so
important to my repose. Men may tell me as much as they please, that my Misery
is without relief; it is because of that that I am void of Comfort. To cure it,
is a work of the Hand of God; and all that Time and my Friends are able to
contribute, does but serve to dispose the matter, which the Almighty must
inform when he pleases. Yet Sir, though my Misfortunes be in their Flood,
they have not drowned the respectfull observance I always used in your
behalf, as having made a vow to coffin up with my self the Quality

Sir, of Your most faithful servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Could heartily wish, that the Sorrow I conceive for my Wifes death, were
capable of Consolation, that so I might make use of the Charitable precepts you
were pleased to give me, for which I render you most humble thanks: But truly
Sir, my Affliction is so great, that if God do not soon play the Physician, I
can expect remedy from nothing but death. So that how constantly soever I bear
my Misfortune, the very Sorrow wherewith it is accompanied, will thrust me by
little and little into my Grave. Not that I have not wholly resigned my self
to the will of God, but because being not able to make this Resignation in all
points absolute, the remainder of my Liberty serves to no other end but to
torment me: Make your Prayers to Heaven for me, that it would please to conduct
me suddenly into that haven of Quiet where you now are: I expect of your
devotion, this favor from the Divine goodness, as you ohght to expect all
manner of service from the friendship I have vowed to you, as being with Passion

Sir, Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Can thank you for nothing but your good will which you witnessed to me, in
those wholesome counsels you were pleased to give me touching the Loss which I
have lately sustained; For how powerful soever your reasons be, they can never
lessen my sorrow, and much less be able to heal it. Those that see my
Misfortune, consider it but as an accident that arrives every day, and which
torments at the same time an infinite number of Husbands: but if they could
penetrate into the bottom of my Soul, that they might know the just cause of
my continual lamentations, the wisest of them would be constraind to approve
the Eternity of my complaints, since they would know thereby how hopeless they
are of cure. It Is true there is nothing else now able to give me satisfaction,
which makes me find some kind of Comfort in the shortning of my days, since I
solace my self in my departure, knowing it tends to the accomplishment of my
Grief. You Will tell me perhaps I speak not like a Christian; I am one howsoever;
but the Affliction to which I have abandond my self, will not suffer me to
enjoy any other Light, than that which shows the way to my Grave. I return to
the obligation wherein I am bound to you for the Honor of your Remembrance and
charitable admonitions, and to witness unto you the Resentment they have left
in me in Quality

Sir, of Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Confess the Admonitions which you used in the last letter wherewith you
were pleased to honor me, touching the loss which I have sustained of late,
by the Death of my Wife, were so Ponderous, that I could not choose but receive
thereby great Consolation. It Is needful (as you say very well) that our first
lesson of Constancy, should be the resignation of our wills to God: and that all the Study which we are to employ therein, should be but to perfect that Action.
I acknowledge it very willingly; the experience which I have learned, will
suffer me to make no further doubt. For God laid the Affliction upon me, and
he himself is my Comforter. His Justice punished me, but his Goodness has
made me find so much sweetness in my Misery, that in stead of Complaints, I am
bound to render him Everlasting Thanksgiving. Howsoever, continue me the Favor
of your good Counsels, with the Honor of your Friendship, and believe if you
please, that I will be all my life,

Consolatory Letters to a Lady or Gentlewoman upon her Husbands Death.
MADAM,
I Had no sooner heard the sorrowful news of your Husbands death, but I put
Pen to paper, to witness unto you at the same time, both the Sorrow which I
conceive, and the Resolution which I have taken to die in your Ladyships
service. If I thought my self able to comfort you, I would do my endeavor
most freely; but the Remembrance of your Virtue forbids me, since it alone is
sufficient to give you the Lessons, which it made you practice heretofore, in
other encounters of Misfortune. It Is true, this is more penetrating than all the
rest; therefore your Constancy should employ all her Endeavors to surmount
your Grief: and since Grace only can give us the greatest part of our force,
you have more (in my opinion) to hope for than to fear, in this Combat. What
if Heaven be provoked against us; it never afrights us with the noise of his
Thunder, but it rejoices us very suddenly with the clear shining light of his
Suns beams. But if you be pressed with impatience in this Surprisall of
Sorrow, dry up your tears, cease the continuation of your Sighs, you shall
find the Sovereign Remedy of all your Ills, in the practice of these actions.
Mine shall be always directed to your Honor and Service, as being from my
heart rather than Mouth,

MADAM,
I Find in my self a greater disposition to lament with you the loss which
you have sustained, than I judge my self able to give you comfort. For if you
be deprived of a Husband whom you loved entirely, I am robbed of a Friend for
whom I would have adventured a thousand Lives. Truly Madam, I am so wholly
taken up in my own Sighs, and tears, that I cannot think of yours, but in
some intermediating Hours, be they never so extreme. So that in stead of
giving you Comfort, I am more like to persuade you to render your Complaints
Everlasting. You may seek an other Husband to a fair purpose, the World is too
narrow to find his Equal. And for my self, I may truly say, the mould of my
old Friend being broken, I should spend my Travail in vain, if I went about
to parallel him amongst my new ones. Let us then solace our selves in our
affliction Madam, since it is extreme: the Extremity of it will soon teach us
the way to our Graves where we shall find a Remedy for our ills. If it be
lawful to love perfectly, no man will hinder us to lament without cease, since
continual tears are the Testimonies of a Perfect Love. In the case I am in at
this present, I am able to give you no other advice; yet if God give you the
Grace to despise my Counsel, I shall never reproach you for it, but rather
beseech you that you would make your Prayers to God, for my like happiness,
and to believe that if I be extremely afflicted, I am no less

Madam, Your most humble servant.

MADAM,
HAving given you a thousand Testimonies of the particular esteem I made of
your Husband, I hope you will not now doubt of the Resentment which remains to
me for his Loss. These lines notwithstanding shall give you a new assurance of
it, and likewise of the good will I have to do you service. If I were capable
of giving Consolation, I would begin with my self, being sensibly touched with
the same affliction which torments you. But I leave that care to your Judgment
and Virtue, considering that the strength of the one will supply my weakness,
and the precepts of the other will exceed all the Counsel and advice I can
impart to you. Besides knowing you to be wholly resigned to the Will of God,
that Resignation will be the sovereign remedy of your distress. The Heavens
do always afford us Comfort for the ills they send us; but they expect
submission, to make us worthy of that favor which I hope you are already in
state to obtain, it being the only Means to live at Quiet in the middle of
Distresses; For my part, I will always interesse my self in yours, as being
with Passion the same I always was,

Madam, Your most humble and most obedient servant.

Answers to the precedent Letters.
SIR,
I Believe the Loss I sustained in the death of my late Husband, does touch
you very sensibly, since in your own particular you are robbed of a most real
friend, and faithful Servant: but for as my own interest, my Affliction is so
great, that if God do not comfort me very suddenly, I shall die very suddenly
of Grief. You may judge by the state I am in at this present, what Comfort I
can expect from my Misery; for, as my Fortune and Happiness are equally buried
in my Husbands Grave, except he revive, I shall never be able to revive out of
the Grave of Sadness, and Discontent. All that I have resolved in this
extremity, is, to resign my self totally to the Will of God; and since your
Prayers may be favorable to me in that behalf, I beseech you for their

A Letter from a Husband to his Wife, comforting her upon the Death of their
Son.
WIFE,
IT is with an extreme Sorrow that I am constrained to trouble your Quiet at
this present with news which at the first view will be able to bear you into
your Accustomed extremity, if it be not supported by the Resignation of your
will to God. But knowing that you are always disposed to undergo the Laws of
his Providence, I take the boldness to let you know that that very Providence
of God, has sounded a retreat out of this World, to our eldest son. This
Accident, how new and strange soever it seem, must not so strictly seize upon
you, that you murmur against the Author. You must resist the attempts of Sorrow
by my example; and after you have shed some Tears, which the Quality of Mother
will constrain you to, you must adore (in drying them up) the Omnipotency of
him that gave the blow; To the end that he redouble not his Wrath, in depriving
us of the Comfort which as yet remains with us. Do not think that I am
insensible at this Misfortune; it touched me to the Quick; and the more,
because I am constrained to partake it with you. But since God has ordaind us
to this Affliction, we ought to witness by the Moderation of our Complaints,
that there is no excess in his Chastisment. I leave the thought of all these
Considerations to your self, with assurance that I remain,

Service: And to assure you, that if you be pleased therewith, I shall never
change the Resolution, to be all my life

Madam, Your most humble and most obedient servant.

Another.
MADAM,
I Should not take the Liberty to let you know how extremely I honor you, if
the Absolute power of your Beauty did not force me to it. Which relating unto
you the violence it uses in my behalf, will easily (I hope) obtain Pardon
for my Presumption. My desire in this is no other but only to know whether you
be pleased I should Everlastingly bear the Quality

Another.
MADAM,
I Could no longer conceal the Resolution which I have taken, to serve you all
my life, and bear the Character of your love eternally, if my Service and Love
be agreeable to you. You may signify it to me, when you please, that I may
have the Honor, and Satisfaction to bear in Public every where the Quality

Another.
MADAM,
I Must of necessity for my own Quiet declare the desire which I have, to
love, and serve you, if you Judge me worthy so great an honor. Your merit
obliged me, and my Inclination constrained me to it. I expect only to know
your will, that I may perfect my determination of professing publicly the style

Answers to the Precedent Letters.
SIR,
I Am much obliged to you for the good will you witness in my behalf: but I
have no other Liberty left me, except to give you thanks, as I do very
humbly: assuring you that I will conserve your Remembrance for an
acknowledgement, in Quality

Sir, of Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Have nothing but thanks to offer up to you for the Honor you were pleased
to do me in your last Letters. And though they be ordinary effects of your
Civility, rather then Proofs of your love, yet I cannot choose but be extremely
obliged to you, which I beseech you believe, and likewise that I am

Sir, Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Do not excuse my self of not answering your last letter, because my Will
does so absolutely depend of my Parents inclination, that you are to learn of
them, that which you desire to know of me. Yet your good will shall oblige me
to be in acknowledgement, all my life,

Sir, Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
YOu know that in the state I am, I must neither accept nor refuse the Offers
which you make me, contenting my self to witness unto you the Resentment
which they left in me, with assurance that I honor so much the Merit of your
Mistress that I shall always prefer it before the Condition

Letters to demand an Answer.
MADAM,
YOur Silence nourishes a Continual doubt in me, whether my Service be
acceptable or not. You may Resolve me when you please by some short Answer, if
you Judge me worthy the favor and Quality

Madam, of Your most humble, and most obedient servant.

Another.
MADAM,
IF you knew with what impatience I expect the favor of your Reply, I assure
my self your Charity would oblige you, to set my Mind at Quiet; But as that is
an Honor, which I must expect from your Goodness, rather than the Passion I
have to your Service (not knowing whether it be agreeable to you or no) I must
have recourse to prayers, beseeching you very humbly to vouchsafe an Answer,
which may authorize the Quality, I bear*

Madam, of Your most humble and most obedient servant.

Another.
MADAM,
THe Resolution I have taken to serve you all my life, does too far interesse
my Repose, not to desire your Pleasure in that respect, I hope for this favor
from your Goodness, as you ought to expect from my duty, all manner of
observance; being desirous to live and die, if you be pleased,

Madam, Your most humble, and most obedient servant.

Another.
MADAM,
THis Letter is so Curious to learn news of her former Companion, that she
would needs be gone in that Pursuit, almost against my will. Let me know then if
you please whether the first was acceptable or no, to the end that either I may
continue you my service, or cease to be further importune. These are the most
humble prayers

Madam, of Your most obedient servant, M.

Answers to the Precedent Letters.
SIR,
I Took the Liberty to write unto you, but not to resolve you in your request.
You know the Quality of Daughter does so subject me, that I cannot violate the
Respect I owe unto my Parents; yet I confess my self much indebted to your
good Nature, being

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Was resolved to keep silence, not knowing what answer to give you; but since
you require a letter, this shall tell you, that I have no other Resolution than
to honor you as your Merit does oblige me: And that in requital of your
Civility, I shall make my self accounted in all places

Sir, Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Send you this Letter, because you desire it, but it is only to assure you of
the small ability I have to satisfy your request: You know you are to adresse
your self to others then to me. Yet I beseech you believe that I esteem my
self much Honored in the testimony of your Affection, being

Sir, Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Am obliged to you for two letters, but I must tell you for answer, that you
are to expect no more from me, having no other liberty, but this only which I
take to assure you of it. I speak not this because I reject the Honor you are
pleased to do me, but because being extremely sensible as I am, the Quality
of Daughter affords me no more power, to publish the style.

Letters upon the absence of ones Mistress.
MADAM,
HAving given you such absolute proofs of Love, as I have done, I hope you will
make no doubt of the grief which your Absence causes in me: You can scarce
believe the one, without giveing credit to the other; and this is the thing
which gives me some kind of Comfort in my Affliction. If I durst presume to
supplicate for your Return, I would do it with as much earnestness, as a
Sick man would implore the presence of his Physician; since I can assure you,
yours is as necessary for my repose, having vowed to live and die

Madam, Your most humble and most obedient servant, M.

Another.
MADAM,
IF you knew, how sensible I were of your Absence, you would scarce be able to
defend your self against the attempts of Pity, how cruel soever you were by
Nature. I suffer a Torment whose report only would force my Enemies to
compassion, and yet can hardly believe that you regard it, being far from
imagining you are touched by it, in the least respect. But since you were borne
into the World for no other end, than to be admired, and I to endure all manner
of misery, I must expect no Remedy but from Patience, and the Consideration of
the Quality which I bear

Madam, of Your most humble and most obedient servant, M.

Another to the same Purpose.
MADAM,
I Have led so sorrowful a Life, since the Day of your Departure, that if I
should recount it to the most insensible souls of the World, it is credible
they would be moved to Compassion. Yet I do not desire to stir up that
Passion in you, sufficing my self that you take notice of it, to the End that
you make no doubt of my Love, and less of my Constancy. I must tell you then,
that having lost both my appetite and repose, I pass over whole days without
eating, and whole Nights without sleep. I may seek Contentment to a fair
Purpose in the Conversation of my Friends, but I can find it only in Solitude,
where my thoughts as ingenious as your self to increase my Affliction,
represent nothing to me but your Cruelty. Judge now if I be not one of the
most wretched Lovers in the World. Yet my Consolation is in this, that I suffer
all these Afflictions for the most worthy Subject living, and for whom I would
loose a Thousand Lives, as being

MADAM,
IF my Life be considerable to you, return very quickly, that I may be cured
of a mortal sickness, which has surprised me by reason of your Absence. You
ought to be careful in conserving me, in the Passion which I have to your
Service, knowing there be few in the World can give so good a Testimony of your
worth, to which long ago I dedicated my self

Madam, A Most humble and obedient servant.

Answers to the Precedent Letters.
SIR,
LOves diseases are so easy to cure, that I never spend my Charity upon such
persons. If you be surprised with that kind of Malady, my Absence (whereof you
complain) will soon afford you a Remedy: but if that should not prove as I
expect, then (to your own advantage) the truth of your Affection will appear by
the continuance of your Constancy, which shall render me, as far as Liberty
permits

Sir, Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
YOu know I am not accustomed to credit, the Complaints of Lovers, because they
dye so often in word and Appearance, that the report of their Afflictions does
now pass for a Fable. This I give you assurance of, and likewise that I am,

Sir, Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
I Believe you suffer less pain, than you have taken to describe, that which
you say my Absence produces in you. My beauty I am sure, cannot cause either
affliction or sorrow in any Man. So that if you continue your Complaints, I
shall be forced to begin my Reproaches; Cease then your discourse of Sorrows,
and Griefs, and Sighs, and Lamentations, it is a Language that Molests me
extremely, and which makes me speak thus freely to you, in Quality

Sir, of Your most humble servant.

Other more obliging Answers to the Precedent Letters.
SIR,
I Am sensible of the affliction, which my absence causes in you, but as it is
unavoidable in the Condition I am in, you must of necessity resolve to be
patient, since it is the only Remedy of your Ill. Do not undertake a Journey
to see me, but expect some occasion or other, which will soon offer it self.
Comfort your thoughts with this hope, and the rather because I will partake in
the Sweetness of it. What need you fear? know you not, that if you love me
extremely, I will revenge my self with the same weapon? and if you be constant
I will loose my life rather than my Resolution to dye

Sir, Your most humble and most faithful servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
IF I had the power to comfort you with my Presence, you should soon see me
where my Letter is now. But being under the Subjection of a Father and Mother,
who give me not so much as the Liberty to write to you, all that I can do is
to steal it, to comfort you with the Hopes of my Return. Believe me Sir, I
wish for it with Passion, since I am to that Point

Letters protesting Love and Fidelity.
MADAM,
I Am constrained to tell you, that of all the Persons in the World you are she
only whom I affect most entirely; These are no Discourses of Complement, my
Soul expressing all her thoughts with the same Innocence that my Mind
conceived them, having no other object but your desert only. If you make doubt
of this truth, serve your self of that absolute power which you have acquired
over me, to oblige my Endeavors to all manner of proofs. My Honor, and
Life, are both at your disposure; I will hazard the one and other, when you
please, either for your Service, or Contentment; since it interesseth my Quiet,
that I be eternally

Answers to the Precedent Letters.
SIR,
THe Lovers of this Age, are so accustomed to divulge their Constancy and
Affection in all places, that they are as far from persuading the belief of it
to others, as they are from the true feeling themselves. What pains you take
in seeking to give me assurance that you love me! I am so far from giving
credit to the least syllable of those discourses made to my Advantage, that it
is a great trouble to me to hear them, being fully satisfied if you love me
in that height that I honor you, since I am

Sir, Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
YOu are too eloquent to be Amorus; a Passion so extreme as that which you
feign in my behalf, could never be able to express it self, but in feeble
terms. Which forces me to a belief that you employed more time in Composing
that pretty Letter, than ever you did in the Sufferings of Love. But howsoever,
your deceit is not so unpleasing to me that I cease to be obliged to your care
in turning it to my Advantage, which I shall always receive, when you are
pleased to reckon me in the Number

Letters Complaining of a Neglect.
MADAM,
I Am Constrained to say that I am most unfortunate, since three years service
could never obtain of you to grant they were pleasing or agreeable. Truly,
though that recompense (as proceeding from you) be of an infinite value; yet me
thinks the effects of so many dutiful regards, might have merited some small
acknowledgment of your Civility. But since I have already learned my lesson of
Love, I am sufficiently instructed in suffering: feeding my thoughts with the
Comfort of this Consideration, that it is You are my Mistress, and I

MADAM,
I Should never have conceived, that since you are publicly honored by all
the World, and perfectly by me, you would have recompensed my Respects with
Contempt, and my Love with Hatred. It Is true, the Slavery wherein I am tied,
forbids me to demand a reason for what you do. Yet my Prison allows me this
Liberty, to tell you that you are too rigorous to be so beautiful: and that
except you change this severe Humor, wherewith you tyrannize over me, you
will run the hazard to lose

Madam, The most humble, and most obedient of all your servants.

Answers to the Precedent Letters.
SIR,
I Wonder you should Complain of my Neglect, having always had Esteem for
your Desert. It Is true, my austere Humor has oftentimes given you subject to
greive; but, I beseech you think I was never guilty, but in appearance only, of
that which you accuse me, being always inclined to nourish a good opinion of
your Merit, in Quality

Sir, of Your most humble servant.

Another Answer.
SIR,
YOu have no pretense to divulge me the most cruel and disdainful Woman
alive: for when you maintain such discourses, those that know my disposition,
will easily know you are in Anger; otherwise neither could they excuse your
humor, nor I your misbeleife. If my actions had merited the proof of your
Study, you would have had a better opinion of my inclination, since the first
time that I have had the Honor to practice you; but such is my misfortune,
that all my Endeavors are not able to nourish in you a good Conceit

Letters Complaining of Inconstancy.
MADAM,
I Never thought that after so many protestations of Fidelity, you would have
lost even the remembrance of having made them. Hereafter, Frailty shall not be
esteemed an adjunct of Humanity, since in yours you are most inhumane, having
thereby exposed to the utmost peril one of your most faithful Admirers. But
live contented in your new Conquest, and know that of all the Servants whom
your Fickleness shall acquire you, you will never find any that will equal my
Affection, or be to that point that I have been

MADAM,
I Must let you know that your Inconstancy has provoked in me more Pity, then
it has procured me ill, being willing to lose the Possession of that to day,
which I could not maintain till to morrow. I say Pity, because I have some
respect to your Honor, which is more interessed in that Action than my
Contentment. I pray God this Lightness may give you as much Satisfaction, as
it caused you blame, in the Eye of the World. I shall always be glad of any
good Fortune that shall happen you, as making profession to be still

Answers to these kind of Letters.
SIR,
I Shall receive Praise rather than Reproach, from all that know the Reason of
my Change; for I was obliged to it in so many respects, that the least of them,
will sufficiently accuse you, for having condemned me. I will give you an
account of this Action when you please, and when you are truly informed how
things passed, I will have no other Judge but your self, what interest, soever
you pretend to have in the Suit. It Is from the Part

Sir, of Your most humble servant.

SIR,
IF you knew with what violence I was constrained to this Mutation, I make no
doubt but you would esteem me far more worthy Praise, than Reproach. Imagine
the power of a Tyrannical Father toward his Daughter under his obedience:
She may weep her fill, he bathes himself with joy in her tears; her
Sorrows, and Lamentations do but increase his fury. This is the case I am in
at this present. I leave to your self to Consider what I am able to do
against so strong an Enemy. The only consideration which remains to me, is,
that if I have lost the Quality of your Mistress, yet I will conserve
