Prologus Iohi^s Rastell.
Like wise as the universal world can never have his continuans but only by
ye order and law of nature which co^pellyth every thing to do his kind so there
is no multitude of pepyll in no realm yt can continue in unite and pease
without they be thereto co^pellyd by some good order and law / wherefore a good
law obseruyd causith ever good people and a good reasonable co^myn law makith a
good co^myn pease and a common wealth a mong a great co^mynalte of people / and
one good governor which causyth one law to be obseruyd among diverse and myche
people brings diverse and myche people to one good unity / but diverse rulers
and governors and diverse orders and laws one contrary to a another and when
that every governor will have the law after his mind brings one multitude of
people to varyauns and deuysyon / for as every man is varyaunt from other in
visage so they be varyable in mind and condicyon / therefore one law and one
governor for one realm and for one people is most necessary / And also lake of
law causyth many wro^ges to be co^mittyd willyngly And lake of knowledge of ye
law causyth diverse wrongys to be done by neclyge^s / therefore since law is
necessary to be had and a verteous and a good thing / ergo to have the knolege
thereof is necessary and a verteous and a good thing / and that that is verteous
and good is good for every man to use / ergo it folowyth it is a good thing for
every man to have the knolege of ye law And sith that it is nescessary for
every realm to have a law reasonable and sufficient to govern the great
multitude of ye people / ergo it is necessary* yt the great multitude of the
people have ye knolege of the same law to the which they be bound / ergo it
folowyth that ye law in every realm should be so publysshyd declared and
wrytton in such wise that ye people so bound to the same might sone and shortly
come to the knowledge thereof / or else such a law so kept secretly in the
knowledge of a few persons and from the knowledge of ye great multitude may
rather be called a trape and a net to bring the people to vexacion and trobyll
than a good order to bring them to pease and quietness / and for as much as the
law of this realm of england is ordey nyd and deuysyd for the augme^tacion of
justice and for the quietness of the people and for the co^myn wealth of the same
/ ergo it is convenient yt every one within this realm bound to the same may
have ye knolege thereof and not reasonable yt any such weys should be had or vsyd
whereby the people should be yngnoraunt of the law / or should be exilyd or
restraynyd from the knowledge thereof. I therefore co^sideringe these foresaid
causes have taken upon me this little labor and study to declare and to expown
certain obscur^ and derke termys co^sernyng the lawis of this realm and ye
nature of certain wryttes for the help and erudicyon of them that be young
begi^ners which intend to be studye^tys of the law for as the philosopher
seythe / Ignoratis terminis ignoratur and ars / that is to sey he that is
ignorant of the termys of any sciens must nedys be ignorant of ye sciens / but
yet I have not enterprysyd this for yt that I think my self sufficient and
able to expowne them as substancially as other deep lernyd men can do / but to
the intent that some ease and furtherau^ce of lernyng may com to young studyentes
by redyng of this same And also I have compylyd and indytyd this lyttyll work
first in the french tongue as is vsyd in the bokys of our law and after
translatyd this same co^pylacion in to our english tongue to the intent that such
young studyentes may the sooner atteyne to ye knowledge of the french tongue /
which knowledge so had shall be a great help and furtherau^ce unto them when they
shall study other higher works of the law of more dyfyculte as be the bokys of
yerys and termys and other books which be writtyn in the french tongue / whereby
they shall come to ye more knowledge of the law / which knowledge of the law so
had and ye true execucio^ of the same law shall be grealy to the augmentacion of
ye co^myn welthe of this realm. which the eternal god incresse and preserve
to his great honor and glory. AMEN

heirs all the right that he has / it is no discontynuaunce / for that / that
the tenant in the tail has no right but for term of life and nothing of

services for tynes and a mercimentes which be assessyd i^ a ^ete but not i^ a
court baron / and also for damage fesaunt that is to sey when he fyndyth ye
bestes or goodys of a another doing hurt or co^beryng his grownd / also a man
may not distrayne for any rent or thing dew for any land but upon the same
land yt is chargyd there with / but i^ case where I come to distreyn and the
other seeing his purpose chasyth the bestys or beryth the thing out to the
intent yt I shall not take it for a distress upon the ground / then I may well
pursue and if I take it inco^tine^t in the hye way or in an other ground ye
taking is laufull as well there as upon the land chargyd to whosoever ever the
properte of the goodys be.

Also for fynys and amercymentys which be assessyd in a let one may always take
ye goods of him yt is so amercied in whose gro^u^d so ever yey be whithi^ ye
iurisdiccgn of ye court. vt dicitur / Also when one has taki^ a distress it
behouith to him to bring it to the commyn pound or else he may keep it in a
nothers ground. and then yt behouith him to gyf notice to ye part for that ye
the perte / if ye dystress be aqwyk best may gyf to it fode / and then if ye
best dys for defaut effode / he that was dystreynyd shall be at the loss / and
then the other may distrayne again for the same re^t or dewte / but if he
bring the dystress to a hold or out of the count that the shyryffe may not
make delyuerauns upon the replenyn / than the perte upon ye return of the
shyryf shall have a writ of wythernam direct to the shyryf that he take as many
of his bestes or as much goodis of the other i^ his keeping till that he has
made delyuera^ce of ye first distres / Also if they be i^ a forslet or castle

Double ple is where ye defe^da^t or tenant in any accion pledyth a ple in the
which ij. matters be co^prehendyd and every one by him self is a sufficient

shall recover the land yet shall recover no damages also there an other wryt of
dower called a wryt of right of dower and it lies where a woman has recoueryd

Fee simple is when lands or re^t or other thing inheritable is geuin to a man
and to his heirs for ever more and these words his heirs make the estate of
inherytau^s for if la^d be geuin to a man for ever yet he has but an estate
for term of life / Also if tenant in fe simple dye his first son shall be his
heir / but if he have no so^ the^ all his daughters that he has shall be his
heir and every one shall have her pert by pertict on but if he have no so^ nor
daughter the^ his next cosyn colaterall of the hole blod shall be his heyer /
Also if there be fad and so^ and the fader has a brother and the son purchesyth
landys in fee and dies without issu then his uncle shall have the land and not
the fader / for yt that land may lynyally descend and not asce^d but if the
uncle dye without issu than the fader shall have the la^d as heir to the uncle
which is his brother for that yt he co^myth to the land by collateral descent
and not by lyniall ascencion Also if the sone purchase landys in fe simple and
dye whithout issu they of his blod on the fadyrs side shall have the land but
if he have no heir on y fadyrs side the^ ye la^d shall descend to the heirs
on ye moders side / but if landys descend to y son on the fadyrs side and he die
th whithout issu then the heirs on y fadyrs side shall have the land but if he
have no heyer on the fadyrs side the heyers o^ the moders side shall not have
the land but ye lord of whom the land is holdyn shall have the^ by eschete /
and the same law is if la^d descend to the son on the moders side / Also if
there be many brethren and if any of the^ purchase landys in fee and dye
whithout issu the land shall descend always to the eldyst brother for yt yt is
he most worthy of blod / Also no man shall have land in fee simple by disce^t
as heir to any man except that he be heir of the hole blod / for if a man
have issu a so^ and a daughter by one venter^ yt is to say by one wife / and a
son by an oyer wife and ye eldist brod purchesith lands i^ fee and dies
without issu / the yo^ger brother shall not have ye la^d but ye dought shall
have the land for that yt she is of the hole blod to the eldyst brother / Also
in the case be fore said if ye fader dye seysyd of lands in fee simple and ye
elder son does ent and dies without issu / the daughter shall have the land
and not ye younger brother but if the elder so^ enter not after the death of his
fad but dye be fore any e^tre made by him / tha^ the younger brother shall have
the land for the possession of the brother in fee simple makyth the suster to be

and ye wife be tenauntys in the tail especial / but if la^dys be geuyn to a
man and to his heirs that he ingenderyth on the body of his wife / then the
husband is tenant in the tail especial and the wife has no thing / Also if
lands be geuyn to ye husband and to his wife and to ye heirs of the body of
ye husband ingenderyd / then ye husband hathan estate in the especyall tail
and the wife has no estate but for term of life / but if landys be geuyn to the
husband and his wife and to the heirs which the husband i^ge^deryth upon the
body of ye wife / in this case both them has estate in the tail for that
theyse wordys heyers does not ly met to one more more than to a another but if
landys be geuyn to the husband and his wife and to the heirs of the husband
which he ingenderyth on the body of his wife than she has no estate but for
tme of life / Also there be diverse other estatys in ye tail / as if la^dys be
geuyn to a man and to his heirs malys of his body begotin in such case the
issue female shall never in heryt / for if the issu male have issu female which
has issu male yet such issu male shall not inheryte by forse of the tail for
it behouith always to convey his descent all by the malys and the same law is if
lands be geffyn to the issu female i^ such mauer / the issu male shall never
inheryt / also if landys be geuyn to a man and to his heyers malys or his
heyris femalis / then the doner has estate in fe simple for that that it is
not lymytyd of whose body the issu shall come Also if la^dys be geuin to a man

marriage / then the man and the woman be tenauntes in ye tail especial / for
by these words frank marriage they shall have the land to the^ and to the
heirs between them be gotyn Also i^ every gift in the tail if ye tenant in
the tail dye without issu which is i^heritable by force of tail and no
forther mencyon made in the grant to whom ye land shall go / then the
reuercyon of fee simple shall reuerte always to the doner and his heirs / Also
the doneez i^ the tail and there issuys shall do like service to the doner and
his heyrs as ye doner does to ye lord next to hiaboue / but ye doneez i^
fra^ke marriage shall hold quyt from all manner service / except fealte till ye

Feffement is where a man geuyth la^dys to an other i^ fee simple and when he

Formedonne is a wryt and it lies where the tenant in the tail i^feffyth a
stranger and dies the heir shall have a wryt of formedome to recover the land

ye cause beforeseyd Also if one gyflandys i^ the tail and for defaut of issu
ye remai^der to a another in ye tail and that for defaute of such issu the land
shall reuert to the donour if ye first tenant in the tail dye without issu he
i^ the remaynder shall have a formedon in the remaynder but if the tenant in

robbyth him of his godys although they be but to the value of a penny. it is

Guard is when that any infant whose auncestour holdyth of a lord by knight
seruise is i^ ye ward of his lord / Also yer be diverse wryttes of ward / one
is a write of right of ward and ye lies where the tenant dies his heir
within age and a stranger enteryth in to the land and happythe to have the ward
of the body of the i^fant A wryt of eiectme^t of ward lies where a man is put
out of the ward of the land without the body of the infaunt / A wryt of
rauishme^t of ward lies where ye body is takyn fro him only and not the land /
Also if a tenant hold of diverse lordis diverse landys that lord of whom the
land is holdyn by pryorete that is to sey by more elder tenure shall have the
ward of the infaunt / but if one tenure be as old as a another than he that
first happyth to have the ward of ye body shall have the ward thereof / but in
that case every lord shall have the ward of the la^d that is holdyn of him /
but if a tenant hold of the king in chef than the king by his prerogatyf shall
have the ward of ye body and of all the land that is holdyn of the king and of
every other lord.

Garrantye of chartres is a wryt and it lies where any deed is made yt
comp^hendyth a clause of warra^ty that is to sey dedi or concessi or this word
wara^tizabo and if the tenant be impledyd by a stranger if it be in assise or
such accio^ where he may not vouch to warra^tye / then he shall have this wryt
against his feffor or his heyer / and if the land be recoueryd aga^st him he
shall recover as much la^d i^ value against him that made the waranty / but
this wryt ought to be sewyd he^gi^g ye first wr^t aganst him or else he has
lost his advantage / Also upon a warrantye in ye law as upon homage
auncestrell or upon rent reseruyd upon a less for term of life or in the
tail a man shall have a wryt of worrantyf of chartres but not upon an
estranger.

Garrantye is in ii. manners that is to say / Garrantye lyneall and / Garrantye
collateral / Garrantye lyneall is where a man seisyd in fee makes a fefeme^t
by his ded to a another and byndyth him and his heir to warrantye and has issu
a son and dies and the warrantye descendyth to his son that is a lyneall
warra^tye for yt that if no deed whith-warrantye had be made then the right of
the landys should have descendyd to the sone / and he should convey ye descent
from the fader to the son / but if ye tenant in the tail dyscontynew the
tail and has issu and dies and the uncle of the issu relessyth to ye
discontynue whith warrantye etc. and dies whithout issu that is a collateral
warrantye to ye issu in ye tail for that yt the warrantye descendyth upon the
issu the which may not convey him to the tail by mean of his uncle / and in
every case where a man demau^dyth lands in fee tail by wryt of formedon / if
any of the issu in the tail which has possessyon or which has not possessyon
makes a warrantye and he that sewyth the writ of formedone may be possybyll by
matter yt may be in deed convey to him title by fors of the gift by him that
made the warrantye etc. that is than a lyneall warra^tie and by such a leneall
warrantye the issu in the tail shall not be barryd / but if yt he have assetz
to him descendyd in fee si^ple but if he may not by no possibylyte yt may be
conuayd to him title by force of the gift by him that made ye warrantye than
that is a collateral warrantye / and by such a collateral warrantye the issu
in the tail shall be barrid without any assetz And the cause that such a
collateral warranttyne is a bar to the issu in the tail is for that ye all
warra^tyes before the statute of glocestour which descendyd to them which be
heirs to them that made yt warrantyes were bars to the same heirs to
demand any landys axcept the warrantyes that began by dysseysyn / and for yt
yt the said estattut has ordeynyd yt ye warranttye of the fader shall be no
bar to his son for the lands which come of the heritage of the mother / nor
the warrantye of ye mother shall be no bar to the son for ye la^dys which come of
the heritage of ye fader and ye statute has not made nor ordeynid remedy
against the warrantye yt is collateral to the issu in the tail / and therefore
the warrantye yt is collateral to the issu in the tail is yet i^ his force and
shall be a bar to the issu in the tail as it was before ye statute / Also it
behouith that all warra^tis whereby any heir shall be barryd that ye warrantye
descend by the course of ye commyn law to him which is heir to him that made
the warrantye or else it shall be no bar for if the tenant i^ ye tail of
lands in borow englysh / where the yongyst son shall inheryte by ye custom
disco^tynuyth the tail and has issu ii. so^nys and the uncle relessyth to the
discontinue with warrantye and d^eth and the younger son bryngyth a formedone /
yet he shall not be barryd by such warrantye causa qua supra / Also if any man
make any deed with warrantye whereby his heyr shuldbe barryd and aft he yt made
the warrantye be attaynt of felony than his heyer shall not be barryd by such
warrantye for yt yt such warrantye might not descend upon him for that yt ye
blod is corrupt / Also if the son purchase landys and after let the landys to
his fader for term of yerysand the fader by his deed thereof infeffyth a
stranger and byndyth him and his heyer to warra^tye and the fader dies where
by the warra^tye descendyth to the son / yet this warrantye shall not bar the
son but ye son may well enter notwithsto^dyng this warrantye for that ye this
warrantye began by disseysyn when the fader made the feffement which was a
dysseisin to the son / and as it said of the fader so yt may be said of every
other auncestour / and the same law is if tenant by elegit or by statute
merchant make any feffeme^t with warra^tye / such warrantyse shall be no barrys
be cause they begin by disseysyn

Gager de delyuerauns is where one sewyth a replenyn of goods takyn but he

gage ye delyuerau^ce than he shall put in suerte or plegges for the delyuerauns
/ and a wryt shall goo forth to the shirif for to redeliuer ye goods etc. but
if a man claim properte he shall not gage the delyuerauns Also if he say that
the bestes be did in the pownde he shall not gage etc. Also a man shall never
gage the delyueraunce before that they be at issue or demurrer in the law vt
dicitur.

Garnyshment is as if accion of detynew of charters be brought agynst one and

plede with the pleyntyf if the conditions be performyd or no / and theruppon a
wryt of scire facias shall go forth against him and yt is called a garnyshment.

Ioyntenauntes be where ii. men come to any landys and tenementys by one joint
title as if a man gyf lands to ii. men and to their heirs / but tenauntys in
common be where ii. men have lands by several tytlis none of them knowith there
of his several as it shall be said after / and note well if there be ii. or iij.
ioyntenau^tes and one has issu and dies yet he or those ioyntenauntys that
over life shall have the hole by ye suruiuor / but if ^i ioyntenauntes make
perticio^ between by deed by agreement than they be several tenauntys but if
one ioyntenaunt grant that ye belongyth to him to a stranger than the other
ioyntenaunt and stranger be tenauntes i^ common / and though two tenauntes in
common be seysyd by pert and by the hole and none knowyth his several yet if
one dye the other shall not have the hole by ye suruiuor but his heir shall
have the half / and so if there be iij ioyntenauntys and one of them makes
fefement of his pert to a another and the feffe dies tha^ his heir shall have
the third pert and the other ij. be ioyntenautys as they were because yt they
ij be seysyd by a joint title. Also if any landys be geuyn to the baron and to
his wife and the baron alyeneth and dies the wife shall recover the hole but
if they were ioyntenau^tes before ye coue^tor then in such case she shall
recover but the half / Also if, land be geuyn to ye baron and to his wife and
to a third person / if the thryd grant that ye belongyth to him / ye one half
passyth by this grant for that that the baron and his wife be but one person in
the law and in this case they have nothing in right but ye half / Also if ii.
ioi^tenauntes be of lands in a town which is borow englysh where landys is
dyuysasable / and one by his testament deuysith that ye belongyth to him to
astranger and dies / this deuyse is void and ye other shall have ye hole by
suruiuour for that ye devise may not take effect till tfter the death of the
deuysour / and inmediate after ye death of the deuysour the right commyth to the
other ioyntenaunt suruiuour by which claymyth no thing by the deuysour but in
his own right by the souruiuour / but other wise it is of perceners seysyd of

Remitt is when a man has ii. titles to any land / and he comyth to the land

ye tail and after dyssesyth his discontinew and dies there of seysyd and ye
landys descendyth to his issu or cosyn collateral by force of the tail / in
that case he is in his remytter.s. seysyd by force of the tail and the title
of the discontynue is utterly adnullyd and defetyd and the reason and cause of
such remitters is for that yt such an heir is tenant of ye land and there is
no person tenant agayns whom he may sew his wryt of tormedone for to recover
the estate taylyd / for he moy not have an accion agayns him self / Also
tenant in the tail infeffe his son and heir apparent in the tail which is
within age and after dies that is a remitt to the heir / but if he were of

folly that he being of of full age would take such a feffement / Also if ye
baron alyen lands that he has in the right of his wife and after take an
estate again to him and to his wife for tme of their lyfys / that is a remitt
to ye woman for that yt this alyenaicon is the act of ye baron and not of the
woman / for no folly may be adiuggid in the woman during the life of her
husband / but if such an alyenacion be by fine in court of record such a
taking again afterward to the baron and wife for term of their lives shall
not make the woman to be in her remitt. for that yt in such a fine the woman
shall be examynyd by the judge / and such examinacio^s in fynes shall exclude
such women for ever Also when ye enter of any man is lawful and he takes an
estate to him when he is of full age if it be not by deed indentyd or matt of
record which shall estope him / yt shall be to him a good remytter

Replication is when the defendaunt in any accyon makes an answer and the

the dystres and yt is called ye retorun of ye bestes and he shall have in such
case a wryt that is called de returno habe^do / Also if it be in any fraunches
or bale wekethe perte shall have a repleuyn of the shyryf direct to the baylyf
of ye same fraunches for to deliver them again and he shall find suerte to
pursue his accion at the next count / and this repleuyn may be removed out of
the count unto ye common place by a wryt of recordare / look more of repleuyn
in the title distres / Also a writ de hoi^e replegiando lies where a man is in

do it not then there shall goo forth a another wryt sicut alias and afterward a
another write sicut plures vel causam nobis significes. which shall be retornable
/ and if ye sh^ryf yet make not repleuyn tha^ there shall go forth an atachement

and dryuyth them in the hye way for to i^pound them and in going they enter in
the house of him whose they be / and he wythholdyth them there and will not
suffer the other to impound them then that withholdyng is rescous

Resceyt is when any accyon is brought against the tenant for the term of
life or tenant for term of yerys and he in the reuercyon commyth in and
prays to be reseyuyd for to deffe^d the la^d and for to pled with the

with the demaundaunt

Scire facias is a writ iudicyall goi^g out of the record and it lies where on

com and can no thing say against the execucion the^ he shall have a wryt of
fieri facias dyrect to the shiryf him commaundyng that he leuey the dett or
dammagis of the goodis of him that has lost / Also this writ of fieri facias
lies with in the year without any scire facias sewid Also if the some of the
same det or dammagis may not be levied of the godis of him that has lost /
the^ he may have a writ of elegit dyrect to the shiryf yt he cawse hi^ to
deliver ye one half of his land and goods except his oxen and i^plementis of
his cart Also when one has recovered det or da^magis in an accion personel

landys or tenementis he he shall have a wryt called habere facias seisinam
dyrect to the shiryffe him commaundyng to deliver to him seysyn of the same
land so recovered
