A few words of direction to the Reader.
I Have not written every place in that order, as is set down in the Title of
this Pamphlet, but of such places as I traveled unto, I have truly related the
passages, and the time, both when, where, why, and how I went, came and
performed it. If any man ask wherefore this Book is good, or how it may be any
way useful, I answer that it is four ways commodious: First, it is
profitable, for it will direct a man the highways of crossing diverse
Countries from place to place, which no other Book shows, as from Leicester to
Linne in Norfolk, from Linne to Kingstone, upon Hull in Yorkshire, from Hull
to York, thence to Hallifax, to Chester, Darby, Nottingham, Coventry,
Lichfield, and the Devils Ars a Peake: all these ways are herein described;
secondly, there are some Monuments of Antiquity are mentioned, which greater
Authors have omitted; thirdly, there are some passages of delightful Mirth
and Recreation. And lastly, all is true, or else you have the Authors leave to
travel as he has done, and do your best and worst to prove him a liar.

Passages and Entertainments from London to Leicester, with some observations
of the said Town and Shire.
UPon Saint Swithins day, I noted well,
The wind was calm, nor any rain then fell,
Which fair day (as old sawes says) does portend,
That heaven to earth, will plenteous harvest send,
The morrow being Julies sixteenth day,
In my Progression I began my way.
I need not to relate the towns that lie
Just in my way, (as I road through or by)
Only at Mims, a Cockney boasting bragger
In mirth, did ask the women for Belswagger,
But strait the females, like the Furies fell,
Did curse, scold, rail, cast dirt, and stones pell mell,
But we betook us nimbly to our spurs,
And left them calling us rogues, knaves, and curs:
With other pretty names, which I discerned
They from their old fore-mothers well had learned.
The reason why they are with rage inflamed,
When as they hear Belswagger named.
Is (as report does say) there dwelt a Squire,
Who was so full of love, (or lusts desire)
That with his fair tongue, Hippocritick-hood,
(By slanderous people 'twas misunder stood)
The women were so fruitful, that they were
All got with child, in compass of one year,
And that Squires name, they say, Belswagger was,
And from that tale, the lying jeere does pass,
Wherefore the women there will chide and swagger,
If any man do ask them for Belswagger.
Thence past I on my journey unto Hockly,
Whereas I saw a Drunkard like a block lie,
There I alighted at the sanguine Lion,
Where I had meat, drink, and a bed to lie on.
The next day I road stately to Northampton,
And all the way my horse most proudly stamped on,
On Thursday, trotting, galloping and ambling,
To Leister, I proceeded in my rambling:
There, at the blue Boar I was welcome than
Unto my brother Miles, a downright man,
Plain dealing, free from flattery, fraud or fear,
Who has lived long with reputation there,
He Is old and honest, valiant, courteous, free:
(I write not this for making much of me)
But they that doubts on it, let them go and try
And if he be a changling, say I lie.
That house King Richard lodged in, his last night,
Before he did the field of Bosworth fight,
And there is a Room, a King to entertain,
The like is not in Leister Town again,
The Assizes then were there, some causes tried,
And Law did there the corpse and souls divide,
Of two offenders, one had with a Knife
Stabd his contracted love, and reav'd her life,
'Tother, a wench that had stolen some poor raiment,
And fired the house, deserved the Hangmans payment.
King Leir a Temple did to Janus rear
And placed a Flamine in it, there does appear
The arched Ovens four yards thick at least,
Wherein they Heathen Sacrifices dressed;
Like as the Jews in their Idolatry,
Offered their sons and daughters impiously,
To Moloeh, Nisroch, Ashtaroth, and Ball:
And to those devilish gods adore and fall,
So people here, when war or peace they sought;
They offerings unto Janus Temple brought;
This was eight hundred forty and four year
Before our Saviors birth, built by King Leire,
Long after Etheldred (the Mercian King)
Ahappy and a Christian change did bring
The Temple razed, the Flamine he defaced,
And there a Christian Bishops Sea he placed,
Which lasted but few years, for then this Land
Was sevenfold yoaked, beneath 7 Kings command
And those Kings still were in perpetual wars
That England was quite spoiled with endless jars
And in those Garboyles Leister had her share,
Spoiled, rifled, ransacked, robbed, and left most bare,
Till Edelfred, with great magnificence,
Repaired and walled it strongly for defense.
Then did it flourish long in wealth and state,
Till second Henry it did ruinate:
He in out-ragious fury fired the Town,
Diswall'd it quite, and cast the Castle down,
So nothing but some raines does appear,
Whereby men may perceive that such things were.
Thus Leister fell, from state superlative,
Her fifty Churches all consumed to five.
Yet it is fair and spacious at this day,
And East, West, North, and South it is every way
Above a mile in length, so that no doubt,
The Town's in circuit six large miles about.
Henry first Duke of Lancaster in war,
In peace, or bounty, a bright blazing Star
For buildings in this City is renowned,
Which as time raised, time did again confound
Yet one large fabric there does still abide
Whereby the good Dukes name is dignifide,
And that is an Hospital or Bead-house, where
One hundred and ten men are harbored there,
From perishing through want, still to defend
Those aged men until the world shall end.
Twice every day a Chaplain does repair
To them; and unto God sends praise and prayer,
And Nurses are allowed to dress their meat,
To make their beds, to wash, and keep them neat:
For which they thankful be to God alone
Who raised such means to ease the poor man's moan.
Good Henry Earl of Huntingdon (renowned)
A free school did erect there, from the ground,
With means (though mean) for majntenance endowed
Two Vshers, and one Schoolmaster allowed,
They teach young lads, such Rules as do belong,
To read the English and the Latin tongue,
And when their knowltdge is with hope discernd,
They is the Greek may learn, and be more learned.
But to relate something in proof of this ancient Town of Leicester, in the
time of nine weeks, which I abode there to and fro, I observed such a civil
government and decency, which is not in many places to be found or equallized.

First, I noted the peace, tranquillity, and unity which the people live in,
under the rule and command of the Major and his brethren, to whose authority
and power (under the King) the inhabitants do willingly obey.

Secondly, the Clergy (or Ministry) are learned, diligent, and painful; and
both Clergy and Layity, are conformable to the Orders and Discipline of the
Church of England, and I did not hear of any one, residing there, that is,
either Schismatically opinionated with Dogmaticall Whimseyes, or
Amster-damnable Fopperies.

Thirdly, they are so charitable, and careful in providing for the relief of
the poor and needy, that a man must go seek where to bestow his alms, for
there is not any one (that I could see) that begged in the whole Town.

Fourthly, the streets are so well paved, and kept so clean from dunghils,
filth, or soil, that in the wettest or fowlest weather, a man may go all over
the Town in a pair of slippers, and never wet his feet.

Lastly, the people are generally so loving one to another, that the Lawyers
want work, and so honest that the Apparitors are idle, and those few Drunkards
which they have, are very civil and fair conditioned.

Certain other observations.
There is a fair Library, and a well founded Almes-house within the Town, also
two Gaoles, two houses of Correction, and for mad and frantic people. Also it
is reported, that when King Richard the Third went from Leicester, to fight the
battle near Bosworth, that then there was a man of mean calling (some say he
was a Weaver, and some say a Plough-wright by his Trade) he had a spirit of
divination or Prophecy, of whom the Tyrant King Richard demanded some
questions, what the event of that days fight might be to him, to whom the
other (most bluntly answered, Mark my words King Richard, that as thou do
ride out of this Town of Leicester, this morning thou shall hit thy right foot
against a stone, and as thou returnest thou shall knock thy head against the
same: which proved true, for as he road, he did strike against the corner of a
wall his foot, and after he was slain in the field, he was stripped, and his
body laid cross behind a man on Hors-back, (like a Calfe) and in that vile and
ignominious manner, as they brought his corpse back to Leicester, his head did
knock against the aforesaid wall or stone, which place I saw there; also I
went eight miles to see Red^^re field, where the King fell, which is a moorish
kind of ground, altogether unfruitful, and the water does seem red, which
some foolish people do suppose to be the stain of K. Richards blood; but it is
only the color of the red earth that makes the water seem so, and the ground
close adjoining is very fertile for Corn and Pasturage, but in the lower parts
it is boggy and moory: by nature, and not either barren or bloody by any reason
of the Kings death.

Another observation is concerning the alteration of the measures of Miles, and
good sufficient Pots or Jugs of drink, but the further I traveled Northward,
the more the miles were lengthened, and the Pots shrunk and curtald; but
indeed, what the liquor wanted in measure it had in strength: the power of it
being of such potencie, that it would fox a dry Traveller, before he had half
quenched his thirst.

In this County of Leicester, I observed a piece of extreme justice, executed
upon three Geese, which was thus.

At a Village called Dadlington, eight miles from Leicester, there dwelsa
Gentlewoman a Kinswoman of mine, who the last Trinity Term 1639 was at London,
about some business in Law, which much concerned her: and in her absence, the
Pinder of Dadlington, finding three of her Geese innocently grazing upon the
Common, for to show the full power, force, virtue, and marrow of his office and
authority, drove the Geese into the Pound or Pindfold, and because they could
procure no Bail for their Release, nor sureties for their true imprisonment,
he put all their three necks into a Horslock, which Engine or Neck-fetter was
so strait, close, and pinching, that the Geese were all strangled: Now the
question is whether Willy, Tilly, (the Pinder so silly) were the cause of their
deaths, or whether the Geese did desperately cast away themselves: all which I
humbly refer to the discretion of the Jury.

But some Readers may muse why I do write so much of Leicester, in this little
Book; the reason is that I lay there from the 17 of July, to the 20 of August,
which was five weeks, but in the mean space, I road to Coventry, and returned
in a day to Leicester again, of Coventry I have little to say, but that it is a
fair, famous, sweet, and ancient City, so walled about with such strength and
neatness, as no City in England may compare with it; in the walls (at several
places) are 13 Gates and Posterns whereby to enter, and issue too and from the
City: and on the walls are 18 strong defensible Towers, which do also beautify
it: in the City is a fair and delicate Cross, which is for structure, beauty,
and workmanship, by many men accounted unmatchable in this Kingdom: although
my self with some others, do suppose, that of Abington in Berkeshire will
match it, and I am sure the Cross in Cheapside at London does far out-passe
it. I have bin at this City four times, and have written of it before, and
therefore at this time (my stay being so short there) I have but little to say,
only this that some are of opinion, that at the first itwas called Coventry,
from the French word Trey Covent, because there were founded three Covents, for
three several Orders of Friars, namely, the Franciscan Friars, the Augustine
Friars, and the Dominicans: It matters not much who erected the said
foundations and Covents, but it is certain, that the renowned King Henry the
Eighth did suppress and demolish them, whose memories now is almost quite
buried in their own ruins. Coventry is a County of it self, it has been
graced and dignified much by the Grant and Privileges given to it by former
Kings, a^ King Edward the Third, and King Henry the Sixth; The Majors name (at
my being there, wa^ Master Thomas Forest a Vintener) and Maste Thomas Phineas
Sword Bearer there dyed at the beginning of the Sessions (much about the tim^
of my being there) he was a man of that comel^ bulk and corpulency, that his
Coffin was a ful^ yard wide at the shoulders, and it is said, that i^ his life
time he could have been (at one meal the consumption of a large shoulder of
Mutton, but he and his good stomach being both deceast, I left Coventry,
because it was Sessions time, and returned to my Randevouze at Leister.

The eleventh day of August I road from Leister to Nottingham, where I lodged
at the sign of the Princes Arms; but I was well entertained at the house of
the Right Worshipful Sir Thomas Hutchinson Knight, himself and his good Lady
made me welcome, and did express their bounty to me in good Cheer and
Money: for the which I am heartily thankful.

The Town of Nottingham is seated on a Hill, which Hill is almost of one stony
Rock, or a soft kind of penetrable sandy stone; it has very fair buildings,
many large streets, and a spacious Market place: a great number of the
inhabitants (especially the poorer sort) do dwell in vaults, holes, or caves,
which are cut and dug out of, (or within) the Rock: so that if a man be
destitute of a house, it is but to go to Nottingham, and with a Mattock, a
Shovell, a Crow of Iron, a Chizell, and Mallet, and such instruments, he may
play the Mole, the Cunny, or the Pioner, and work himself a Hole, or a
Burrow, for him and his family: Where, over their heads the grass and pasture
grows, and beasts do feed; fair Orchards and gardens are their coverings, and
Cowes are milkt upon the tops of their houses. I was much befriended by Master
Palmer the Iaylor there; for he went with me, and showed me the (sometimes)
strong and defencible Castle, but now much ruined: yet still there are many
fair and sumptuous rooms in reasonable reparation and estate. On the lofty
Battlements of the said Castle, there is a most spacious prospect round about:
for from thence I could see the most stately Castle of Belvoyre or Bever
Castle, which does (as it self) belong to the Right Honorable the Earl of
Rutland: and nearer hand, within three miles, I saw the ancient Town of
Gotham, famous for the seven Sages (or Wise men) who are fabulously reported to
live there in former ages.

In the aforesaid Castle of Nottingham, I was showed diverse strange wonderful
Vaults, cut or hewn out of the Rock, whereof one is said to be the place
where David King of Scots was detained many years in captivity: where the said
King, with his own hands (without any other instrument than the nails of his
fingers) did with the said tools engrave and claw out the form of our
Saviors Life, death, and passion; which Work is there to be seen upon the
Walls.

Also there is another Vault or passage through the Rock, whereby men may
descend or ascend out, or into the Castle; which vault is called Mortimers
Hole, through which hole (as report goes) the great Roger Mortimer, Earl of
Wigmor, and Lord of Wallingford had egresse and regresse to the Queen, wife to
King Edward the second, or the unfortunate Edward of Carnarvan.

Thus having seen as much of Nottingham Town and Castle as is related; on the
twelfth of August, I road to the ancient town of Darby: On the thirteenth of
August I left Darby, with an intent to retire to Leister; but after I had road
half a Mile, I met with an acquaintance of mine, who was travailing toward
the Peake in Darby shire, to a Town called Wirksworth, and from thence to
Chiesterfield, I returned with him. The Country is very Mountainous, and many
Lead Mines are found thereabouts: the best and most richest is called Dove
Gany, within a mile or little more of Wirksworth (corruptly called Wortsworth:)
and two Miles from thence are most dangerous ways, stony, craggy, with
inaccessible Hills and Mountains: the grounds there are lawful (as they told
me) for any man to dig or mine in for Lead, be they of what condition soever:
for the Laws of mining is, that those that will adventure their Labors shall
have all the profits, paying the tenth part to the Lord or Landlord, of all the
Lead which they get. If it happen that they take pains, a year or two in
sundry places to find a Mine if their fortune be so hard to find none (as it
often falls out so) they do work all that while for nothing, and find
themselves as they are able, and in the end their toil and labor is all lost:
but if they do hit upon a good Mine that does hold out, and yield plentifully,
then they may quickly enrich themselves (if they be good husbands.) I was told
of a poor Thatcher that left his Trade, and venturing his time and pains, he
found so rich a Lead Mine, that he would turn Gentleman, and he kept men in
Liveries, living at the rate of the expense of 100 pound a week; so that he
supposing that Leaden, Golden World would never be ended, took no care to save
any thing, but after a while, the Mine failed, and he spent that little which
he had left in digging for more, could find none, so that for a conclusion,
he forsook the Peake, and turned Thatcher again.

That part of the Peak, which is called the Devils Ars, is at or near a Town
named Castleton, or Castle Town, so styled from an ancient ruined Castle on a
Hill, at the end of the Town, it is 30 miles from Darby, the Castle stands on
the top of a Hill, and under it is a Cliff or Riffe in the said Hill, which is
as wide at the entrance as three Barn doors, but being entered in it is
enclosed again so narrow, that a man must stoop to pass further, but after
that straight passage is past, there is rooms of incredible and wonderful
greatness, with strange and intricate turnings and windings, which no man can
see without great store of lights, and by reason that those things are
natural, and formed without any attor labor of man, and with all so dismal
hotrid, dark, and hideous, that place is called the Devils Ars a Peak, at or
upon which I have (according to my promise) given three jerks with my pen, at
the latter end of this Book.

From thence I returned toward Leicester 30 miles, on the 15 of August, and
lodged at a Market Town called Narbury, and the next day I came all tired and
weary (both man and beast to Leicester) and on the 20 day, I took my journey 64
miles into Norfolk, to the famous Town of Linne, and three miles from thence,
at a Village called Wooton, I was there well welcomed by Master Richard Miles
(to whom I am and must be a thankful Brother in Law) whose loving kindness to
me was showed in such extraordinary manner, which because I cannot express, I
will remayn grateful with silence.

Concerning Linne, it is an excellent Sea-town and strong Port, it is gravely
and peaceably governed by a Major, 12 Aldermen, and a Recorder. It has bin
honored by diverse, but chiefly by King John 440 years since, and by King Henry
the Third, the first gave them a fair gilt Cup, which is there to be seen, as
a witness of his Royal liberality: and who so will know more of Linne, let
them go thither and look the Records of the Town, or else let them read Master
Camdens Britania, or the painful labors of Master John Speed. The troth is,
mine Host Noble, was a noble Host to me, at whose house, my brothers kindred
and friends, gave me a friendly farewell. On Tuesday the 27 of August, from
Linne to Boston in Lincolnshire 24 miles, where I dined with the right
Worshipful Sir Anthony Thomas Knight, from Boston I road 14 miles to Horn
Castle, where I lodged the 28 of August. But I crave pardon of the Reader, for
I had almost forgotten a merry passage or two which happened in Norfolk, not
far from Linne: and thus it was.

At a place called Priors Thorns, near to two Towns, namely, Northbery and
Sapham, there dwelt a man named Friar, who was rich in substance, but very
poor and miserable in his conditions: belike he had read or heard of a Play
that was written 40 years since by Master Benjamin Johnson, the Play is extant,
and is called Every Man out of his Humor, in which Play was acted and
personated a mizerly Farmer, that had much corn in his Barnes, and did expect
a scant or barren Harvest, that through want and scarcity he might sell his
corn at what dear rates he pleased, but (contrary to his wicked hopes) the
Harvest proved abundantly plentiful, wherefore he being in an extraordinary
merry or mad vein, put himself to the charge of the buying of a two penny
halter, and went into his Barn as secretly as he could, and putting the halter
about his neck with a riding knot, he fastened the other end to a beam, and most
neatly hanged himself: But (as ill luck would have it) his man presently came
into the Barn, and espyde his Master so bravely mounted, the unlucky Knave
drew his Knife and cut the halter, crying out for help as loud as he could,
rubbing and chafing his Master with all care and diligence to recover him to
life again; at the last he awaked out of his trance, and fetched a deep groan,
began to stare and look about him; and taking the end of the cut halter in his
hand, his first words to his man was, Sirrah, who did cut this, O Master (said
the fellow) it was I that did it, and I thank God that I came in good time to
do it, and I pray you to take God in your mind, and never more to hazard your
soul and body in such a wicked manner: to which good counsel of the poor
fellow, the Caitiffe replyde, Sirrah, If you would be meddling (like a sawey
busy Rogue) you might have untyde it, that it might have served another time,
such an unthristy Rascal as thou will never be worth such a halter, it cost me
two pence, and I will abate the price of it in thy quarters wages. And when the
quarter day came, he did abate the said two pence, for the which the fellow
would dwell no longer with him, but went and got him another service: This was
acted really and lately at the place aforesaid, in imitation of that part in
the Play, of Every Man out of his Humor.

After the said Friar had some Hogs which were like to die with the Murrain,
which Hogs he killed and powdered, and his wife, children, and Family, as many
as did eat of the Porke, fell sick and dyed all: for the which the slave
deserved a hanging, and a Hangman, but he yet lives for some worse purpose.

Concerning a pair of Brewers, and a piece of justice. Another short Norfolk
Tale is not impertinent. There was one Master Fen a Brewer at Fensham, and one
Master Francis Dix a Brewer at Sapkam, this Dix was riding in the Country
amongst his Customers (the Inkeepers and Victuallers) and he called for a pot
of Ale or Beer as heroad by; (now that Alehouse was a Customer to Fen, as
soon as Dix had drank, he asked who brewed that drink, to whom the Hoastesse
said, that Master Fen of Fensham brewed it; well said Dix, I dare lay a wager,
that I will give my Marc but a peck of Malt, and she shall piss better drink
than this: at the last these words came to Fens hearing, for the which
disparagement, he sued Dix, and recovered from him twenty pound damage besides
costs, at the Assizes last at Norwich 1639. And now to return to the narration
of my Travels, from whence I have digrest, since I lodged at Horn Castle in
Lincolneshire.

From thence on the 18 of August, I road 30 miles to Barton upon Humber, and
the next day (being Friday) I took a Boat for my self, my Squire, and my two
Palfreyes, down to Hull, or Kingstone upon Hull, the strength and situation of
which Town I have formerly written of: and I had no new thing there whereof to
make any new Relation: let it suffice, that it is absolutely accounted the
strongest and most defensible Town in the Kingdom of England, and for good
government inferior to none: I might speak somewhat of their good fellowship;
but my Book would swell big with it, therefore I will pay them with thinking
and thanking of them, both my old friends and new acquaintance all in general.

The 31 of August I left Hull, and road to Holden 16 miles, and on the morrow I
road to Cowood Castle, to see the most Reverend Doctor Neale, the Lord
Archbishop of York his Grace, whom in all humility I do acknowledge my self
much bound in duty daily to pray for, and remember him with unfeigned reverend
thankfulness, not only for the undeserved favors and bounty which his Grace
extended toward me now, but for many other former approvements of his Graces
love and liberality, when his Grace lived near me at Winchester House. At
Dinner with his Grace, I had the happiness to renew my Acquaintance with the
Noble and Worthy Knight Sir Francis Wortley? who most courteously invited and
commanded me to visit him in my journey, of which more follows.

My humble thanks rememberd to the right worthy worshipful Knight Sir Paul
Neale, with his fair and virtuous Lady, as also my Grateful remembrance to all
my Lords Gentlemen and Servants, to whose loves and for whose friendships I
shall ever acknowledge my self an engaged Debtor.

Thus having past the Sunday with my Lords Grace, and those other before named
Gentlemen. On Monday the second of September, I took my Breakfast and my leave
both of Cowood, and road to York, where I visited the worthy Knight (my old
acquaintance) Sir Arthur Ingram, with whom, I thank his Worship, I dined, and
also had some other token of his love and bounty, for the which I remayn
thankful.

Of York I have but little to say, though it be a great, a fair, and the
second City in England, built 989 years before our Saviors Birth, by Ebrank
King of this Land, from whom the City is called Eboracensis, this Ebrank is
said to have 21 Wives, by whom he had 20 sons, and 70 daughters: he reigned
here when as King Solomon Reigned in Jerusalem; he overran France, he builded
Alclaid, or Dumbritton in Scotland, he founded York, he erected a Temple
there, and therein placed a Flamine to Diana: but after (in King LUCIUS time)
Elutherius pulled down the said Idolatrous wooden Temple, and displaced the
Flamine, and caused tho Minster to be built in that magnificent manner of free
stone, placing there an Archbishop; severus the Roman Emperor dyed there, and
also there dyed the Emperor Flavius Vallerius Constantius (which some call
Chlorus) those that will know more of York, let them read Chronicles and
larger Volumes.

The Lord Major of York was (at my being there, one Sir Roger Jacques Knight, a
Gentleman of approved wisdom and government: myself did not stay three hours,
and mine Host Master Corney at the Talbot, told me all the news which I heard
there, which was a fellow, that (amongst other offenders) was the first that
was hanged, and the last that was cut down, and being put into the grave or
pit, with his fellows, when the earth was cast upon them, he began to stir and
recover life, and was returned to the Jail is now there living, and able to
report truly what hanging is, Probatum est.

From York I rode after Dinner to Tadcaster, and so to a place called Kidell,
where at a poor Alehouse I was glad of entertainment, and had the company of
a Tinker who made pretty Music with his Banbury Kettle-drum, there was also
with him two Drovers and 35 Hogs, which were to be driven on the morrow seven
miles further to Leeds Market, this good lodging and company, I past the night
with all, and on the morrow, I road to the Town of Leeds; of which Town I must
say somewhat. This Town is (for the bigness of it) one the most populous Towns
in England, it has in it above 12000 people, and having but one Church there,
it was not half capable to receive so great a Congregation, they were extremly
thronged and dangerously crowded (especially in the heat of Summer, or sultry
contagious weather) that the most part of the people were enforced either to go
two or three miles several ways to other Village Churches, or else to stay at
home and want the hearing of Gods Word, and the means of their salvation. The
care and consideration of these Grievances entered into the pious mind of one
Master John Harrison Gentleman there, (now living) so that God opened his
heart, that of his own proper costs he caused a Church to be built (though it
have but the name of a Chapel) which is so large, that it will contain 4000
people, it is so neatly compacted and framed, with exquisite art of carving and
Masonry, with painting, gilding, polishing, embellishing, and adorning, with a
most stately Roof, a fair losty Tower or Steeple, a sweet Ring of Bells;
besides the admirable and costly Joyners and Carvers Workmanship in the Font,
Pulpit, Pewes, Chancell, Communion Board, and all other things and ornaments
for the decent adornment of such a House consecrated and dedicated to the
Service of God. I do absolutely affirm, that neither the Church or the Founder
has any fellows to be found.

This Chapel is called by the name of Saint John Evangolist, it has a fair
Churchyard for Burials, well and strongly walled about, and at the West end of
the Churchyard, the said Gentleman has founded a fair Almse-house, and
therein placed 21 poor aged people; also he has founded and finished a fair
School-house for the instruction of youth, and a fine sweet street he has
built on both sides in a uniforme and fair manner, with Houses: the Rents
whereof are for the mayntenance of the Almeshouses, the School, and
Reparations of the Church to the end of the World. And I leave this worthy
Founder to God for a blessing, and to the World for imitation.

From Leeds I went to Wakefield, where if the valiant Pinder had been living, I
would have played Don Quixot's part, and challenged him; but being it was so
happy that he was dead, I past the Town in peace to Barnsley, and so to
Wortley, to Sir Francis Wortleyes ancient House. The entertainment which
himself, his good Lady, and his most fair and hopeful daughter gave me
there, as I never did or can deserve, so I never shall be able to requite, to
talk of meat, drink, money, and free welcome for Horse and Man, it were but a
mere foolery for me to begin, because then I should run myself into a
Labyrinth, out of which I should hardly find the way: Therefore to his
Worship, my humble thanks remembered, and everlasting happiness wished, both to
him and all that is his. Yet I cannot forbear to write a little of the further
favor of this Noble Knight. Upon the fourteenth of September afternoon, he
took horse with me, and his Lady and daughter in their Coach, with some other
Servants on horseback; where three miles we rode over Rocks and Cloud-kissing
Mountains, one of them is so high, that (in a clear day) a man may from the
top thereof see both the Minsters or Cathedral Churches, York and Lincoln,
near 60 miles off us; and as it is to be supposed, That when the Devil did
look over Lincoln, as the Proverb is) that he stood upon that Mountain) or
near it: Sir Francis brought me to a Lodge, the place is called Wharncliffe,
where the Keeper dwells, who is his man, and keeps all this Woody, Rocky, Stony,
Vast Wilderness under him, for there are many Dear there, and the Keeper were
an Ass if he would want Venison, having so good a Master.

Close to the said Lodge, is a Stone in burden at the least 100 cart loads,
the top of it is four square (by Nature) and about 12 yards compass, it has
three seats in the form of Chaires, made by art (as it were in the front of
the Rock) wherein three persons may easily sit, and have a view and goodly
prospect over large Woods, Towns, Cornfieldsd, fruitful and pleasant Pastures,
Valleys, Rivers, Dear, Neat, Sheep; and all things needful for the life of
man: contained in thousands of Acres and all (or the better part, belonging to
that Noble Knights Ancestors, and himself. Behind the Stone is a large
Inscription engraven, where in an old character is described the ancient memory
of the Wortleys(the Progenitors to Sir Francis now living) for some hundreds of
years, who were Lords and Owners of the said Lands and Demaynes which he now
holds as their right Heir. About a Bow shoot from thence (by the descent of
many rungs of a ladder) his Worship brought me to a Cave or Vault in a Rock,
wherein was a Table with feats, and Turfe Cushions round, and in a hole in the
same Rock, was three Barrels of nappy liquour, thither the Keeper brought a
good Red Dear Pie, cold roast Mutton, and an excellent shooing-born of hanged
Martimas Biefe: which cheer no man living would think such a place could
afford: so after some merry passages and repast, we returned home.

On the fifth of September, I hired a Guide, and rode to Hallifax 16 miles, the
ways were so rocky, stony, boggy and mountaynous, that it was a days journey to
ride so short a way. At Hallifax I saw the fatal Engine, wherewith they do
behead pilfering Thieves, which Sir Francis Wontley told me was set upon this
occasion following.

This Town of Hallifax has (for time out of mind) lived and subsisted by the
rich and laudable Trade of Clothing, and oftentimes their Clothes were stolen
from the Tenterhooks, (or Tenters) whereupon the King (then Reigning) upon
their humble suite had privilege granted to the Town for ever: That if a
Thief were taken, either of these three ways, which is, Handnapping,
Back-bearing, or Tongue-telling, that is, either about to steal, or carrying
it away, or confessing, that then the party offending (after trial by a Jury
of Townsmen) if the goods, be it cloth, cattle, or whatsoever is valuable, is
judged to have their heads struck off with the said Engine, without any Assize
or Sessions. Now the Engine is two high pieces of Timber, an ell or yard
asunder, fixed and closed on the top, with a cross piece like a Gallowse; in
the inner sides of the two standing pieces are two gutters, and on the top (or
cross piece is a pulley through which they do put a small Line or Rope, and
fastening it to another heavyer piece of wood of 100 weight (in which they do
fix the sharp-edge-toole) then they do pull or hoyst up the said weight, and
the stolen goods is brought to the place of execution with the Malefactor; now
one end of the Rope is made fast to a pin or stake, which being cut, the
Engine falls so ponderously and speedily, that it sovers the head from the body
in a moment, but there is no man will or must cut the Line, but the Owner of
the stolen goods, which if he do, he has all again: if he will not cut it,
then he must lose all, and it is employed to some charitable uses; by which
means the Thief escapes; and this is Hallifax law.

The sixth day I left Hallifax, and road oversuch ways as are past comparison
or amending, for when I went down the lofty Mountain called Blackstone Edge,
I thought my self with my Boy and Horses had been in the land of Breakneck, it
was so steep and tedious, yet I recovered 12 miles to Rochdale, and then I
found smooth way to Manchester, and to Sandy Lane end 13 miles; and to Chester
14 miles, which was the furthest place of my tedious travel.

For my short stay at Chester (which was but one day and two nights, I had good
and friendly entertainment, of many Gentlemen, to whom I must rest thankful,
especially to the Worshipful Master Alderman Edwards, and to Master Wright and
his Wife. It was my fortune to see and rejoice at the sight of the Noble, Right
Honorable Earl and Knight of the Renowned Order of Saint George, William Earl
of Darby: And although I have no relation to his Lordship or acquaintance with
him, yet for the reverend reverend respect which I do owe and bear to
Nobility, it did me good to see so grave and honorable a Peer.

The City of Chester, is of ancient erection and fame, it was the Royal Seat
of Kings, and there are yet some ruins left of the memorable Palace of King
Edgar, to which Mansion the said King was rowed in a Barge by eight Captives
(or Tributary Kings from Saint John's) on the River of Dee, which River there is
spoiled and impeached by a bank of stones all over it, only for theemployment
of a Mil or two, which River other ways would be both passable and profitable
to the whole Country, for many miles, for the carriage of goods in Boats and
Barks. Chester itself is a fair City four square, well walled, with an old
ruined Castle, which has been a strong Fabric, but now a Jail, the streets
are spacious, the buildings sumptuous, and so contrived, that four or five men
may walk in the most parts of a breast, dry from the injury of Rain, or any
falling Weather: it is gravely and peaceably governed by a Major and his 12
Brethren, it has four Gates and three Posterns, goodly Churches, and chiefly
painful and learned Preachers. And so much for Chester.

Only a merry Tale, of a late true business which happened there; There dwelt a
Bricklayer, a good Workman (but a good husband) whose name was John Tilly, who
had the good hap to spend all that he got in his lifetime, except two sons
and one daughter: And being sick and in his deathbed, there came a poor
neighbor to visit him, whom he desired to make or write his last Will and
Testament; the poor man (having Ink and Paper) asked him what he should write?

Quoth honest John Tittle, my estate is but little, but I pray thee write thus.

IMprimis, I give and bequeath to my Wife (for her solace and comfort) my
little Dog, for it is a pretty nimble active Curre, and will make her some sport
which may delight her, and put the grief of my death out of her sad remembrance.

Item, I give and bequeath to my eldest son John, all my working Tools
belonging to my trade of Bricklaying, which as he may use, may be as available
to him, as they have been to me, and this is the sum of my Will.

His youngest son standing by, said, Father, have you nothing to give me?
Yes son (quoth he) I had almost forgotten thee, but I will leave thee
somewhat.

Item, I give and bequeath to my son George seven foot of ground under the
Gallowse.

Good father take comfort (said George) for my hope is that you will recover,
and live to enjoy that Legacy your self.

Then the daughter prayed him to give her somewhat whereby she might remember
his fatherly love, Yes, quoth he, I pray write.

Item, I give and bequeath to my only daughter a Whores conditions and
qualities, which as she may use them, she may live in such estate and fame
that she may be mistaken for a Gentlewoman.

Lastly, I do make and ordain my Neighbor here, my full Executor: and for
his pains for writing my Will, I do give him and his heirs male for ever, an
old shooing-horn.

The ninth of September I turned my back upon Chester, (almost without taking
leave) and road 15 miles to Nantwich, the tenth I rode to Stone and to
Lichfield, 22 miles.

Of the Ancient Town of Lichfield I can say nothing (by reason of my short
stay) only there is a fair and curious old Cathedral Church or Minster.

And the Town has that privilege (as mine Host told me) that they can draw
and hang one another, and never trouble any other Judge, Assize, or Sessions.

The eleventh I rode to Faseley, Abersom, Hinckley and Dadlington, eighteen
miles, where all weary and almost worn out with age and travel, I rested
until Saturday the fourteenth of September, and then rode eight miles to my
brother Miles, at my old welcome lodging at Leicester.

News from Hell, with a short description of the Hell at Westminster.
NOt from that Hell where souls tormented lie
In endless Death, and yet shall never die,
Where gnashing cold, commixt with flames still burning,
Where Is entrance free, but never back returning:
Where naught but horror, fiends, and torments dwell;
I bring no news from that accursed Hell;
Yet mine own merits are of such low price,
To bar me from Celestial Paradise,
And sink me in that horrid Lake infernal,
But that my hope and faith is fixed supernall.
The Hell I write of is well known to be
A place of pleasure, and for all men free,
Where wretched Ghosts are not in torments stayed,
For all the pains upon the purse is laid.
To find this Hell you need not travel far,
It Is understood the high Exchequer Bar
At Westminster, and those who thither venture,
Do not give Cerberus a sop to enter,
For Charons fury, you need never fear it,
(Although ten thousand do land somewhat near it)
Within this Hell is good content and quiet,
Good entertainment, various sorts of diet,
Tables a score at once, in sundry places,
Where hungry mouths fall to, and say short Graces,
And then (in some sort) I may parallel
This earthly Hell, with the infernal Hell.
Hot sweltring vapors, Pots, and Cauldrons boiling,
Great vehement fires, with roasting, stewing, broyling;
The Cooks and Scullions, all be smeared and smoked,
And in their Masters Grease well stewed and soaked,
And had the Devil a stomach unto it,
The Cook himself is not the rawest bit.
Like as the infernal Hell does entertain
All comers, so this Hell does not refrain
To give free welcome unto every one
If money fail not, there is excepted None.
This Hell is governed by a worthy Duke
That Pluto like, his under fiends rebuke,
There the tormenting Tapster is controlled,
If courteously he Nick not (as he should)
He must attend at every knock and rap,
His reverend Judge decked with a frothy cap,
He fills and empts, and empts and fills again
Like Sisyphus, he toils, but not so vain,
Like Danaus daughters, taking up, and spilling,
He Is always emptying, and he is never filling.
Thither the Counselor for comfort comes
To rince his toyling tongue, and wash his gums,
The Client having Tityus empty maw
(His guts tormented with the Vulture Law)
He coming to this Hell may find relief,
Of comfortable Plumbroath, and Roast Biefe.
There, for your solace you may feed upon
Whole Seas of Pottage, hot as Phlegeton,
And midst those Seas, by art, the Cooks has laid
Small Isles of Mutton, which you may invade
With stomach, knife and spoon, or tooth and nail,
With these, the victory you cannot fail.
Therefore this earthly Hell is easier far,
Then where the miserable damned are,
There Is no redemption from that black Abisse,
And here regresse, as well as egresse is,
Therefore they falsely do mistake the story,
To call this Hell, which is but Purgatory,
For here is no Thraldom, from this place you may
Get present freedom, if the shot you pay.
Here follows three Satyricall Lashes or Jerks, given with the Pen of the
Author, at or upon the Devil's Ars a Peak.
PEns, are most dangerous Tools, more sharp by ods
Then Swords, and cut more keen then Whips or Rods;
Therefore (most high and mighty Duke of Dis)
C^mmander where the Lake Avernus is,
Great Lord of Limbo, S yx, and Phlegeton,
Of Tartarus, Gehenna, Acheron,
Most potent Monarch of black Erebus,
Prince of the Triple-headed Cerberus,
Sole Emperor of Darkness, and dark works,
Master of Heretics, Infidels and Turks,
Arch-flammin of hot Tophets smouldring flames,
King of Cocytus, and the infernal streams,
Earl of all Errors, and chief Dominator
Of all sins done, by Earth, Air, Land, or Water,
Viscount, and Baron of large Barathrum,
Since I have lived to come so near your Bum,
As is your wicked Worships Ars a Peake,
Though some men think my Muse is all too weak;
I with my Pen do mean to yerke and ferke ye,
And (as I promised) with three jerkes will jerkeye.
I know that many fools will jeere and frumpe,
That I durst come so near the Devils Rumpe,
And lash with my poor pen Satyricall,
This great Don Diego Diabolical:
But I would have him and his friends to know,
I jeere him not, for all his Bug-bare show:
It Is known that he, and all that him attend,
To any Poet never was a friend:
And therefore now I daring him oppose,
And jerke his hellish Majesty in Prose.
ALthough you (great Master of the perpetual Hot-house) Don sell de Lucifer,
have on the Earth in all places and Countries many multitudes of damnable
sons, friends, and servants, to oppose me and take your part, yet I being
come so near your Podex, must jerk your breech with my Satyr Pendragonly Goose
quill, you know that reproof is as ill taken as correction by the ungracious.
Therefore although you are so bad that you are quite past any mending, yet your
graceless Majesty may be lawfully touched by reprehending; you have been a
Cheater ever since the Creation, and in that Art of Coozening, youfirst cheated
your self of everlasting happiness, and gained thereby perpetual perdition,
and ever since you have played Hocus Pocus, and with your tricks, sleights, and
juggling Legerdemayne, done your best to draw all the whole Race of Mankind
after you into your Kingdom of Cimerian Tenebrositie; you taught our first
Parents Infidelity, Pride, Disobedience and Lying, which qualities of theirs
are so naturally descended to us, that (by your industrious instigation) we do
continually show (by our lives and conversations) of what house we came. By
their example of believing too much in you, we are grown incredulous in things
which most concerns our better and best of being, and we are so inured and
practisde in lying, (by your inspiration being the father of lies) that we are
doubtful to believe one another. And yet (like the Cretans) with long use and
custom, we do many times believe our own lies to be true.

May it please your infernal Hell-hood to take into your execrable
consideration, that you were the first inventer of the most ignoble Science of
Offense, you taught Caine the Imbrocado, and showed him how to murder his
Brother, and from that time to this, the Art of Murdering, Killing, and Cutting
Throats has been universally and perfectly learned and practiced. You have
been the inventer of all manner of destroying Weapons, from the high degree of
the Welsh-hook, to the lower descent of the Tailors Bodkin; and in these later
times you (with the help of a Friar) have devisde a burning, smouldring, most
Hellish and undefencible mischief that murders men by heaps, and (with a
powder) can blow whole Kingdoms into the Firmament; and for the innumerable
Engines that are daily used and cast for such uses, your most high and
Imperial malediction have declared your self an excellent Artist, from the
double Cannon to the Elder Gun-mines, Countermines, Petards, Grenades,
Fireworks, Wildfire, and the Devil and all do continually seek and work the
destruction of miserable Mankind. You are a great Traveller, and will take the
pains to compass the whole earth to find a just man, on purpose to do him a
mischief, but for a crew of common Drunkards, Rascals, Bawds and Whores, you
know you need not wet your foot to seek them, they are your own already, and by
your good will, you would fill Hell so full, that Heaven should have but a few.

And so let that pass for one and the first Jerke.
SEcondly, you know that there is but one narrow way to happiness, and many
ways to your Zona Torrida, Frigida, (for all those large ways do meet in one
at the last, and bring poor souls into your pestiferous Pursnet) some go by
the way of Sodom, to find out your most damnable Mansion, some by the way of
Incest, some by Adultery, some by Fornication (for they say you are the Master
of the Honorable and Worshipful Company and Brotherhood of the Fornicators)
in which regard you are a great friend to Parators and Panders. You showed Cham
the way how to deride his father, by which example a company of Chammists, have
ever since practiced not only to mock, scoff, and abuse their natural
parents, but also to contemn, rail and revile against Kings and Princes, who
are the Royal Fathers of Terrestrial Government, and further to despise,
slight, and libell against the most Reverend Fathers, the Stewards and painful
Dispensers of the spiritual food of Eternity; you directed Corah and his
Accomplices the high rode-way to murmur; Achitophel to give wicked counsel, and
Absolon to rebel and usurp; you showed Ioab the way to Treachery, Achan
tosteale, Jobs wife to abuse her husband, from whom the most part of women
(like apt scholars) are very expert in that kind of miserable mystery. You
put Gehezi into the highway of taking a bribe, and it is too well known what a
wicked number of followers he has had of all degrees, from the Scepter to the
Swain, from the black Gown to the buckrum bag. You directed Nabal(who
Anagrammatized or lead backward is Laban) to be as churlish as a Hog, from whom
miserable Dives has perfectly learned the way to true misery, you taught
Nimrod the way to tyrannize, and enclose and encroach upon Land and
Territories, which has been the bounding, mounding, and curtalling of
Commons. The raising of Ambition, Pride, Voluptuousness, and such earthly
virtues of accursed Greatness, and to the Almighty making of Beggars. You tie
fast the Rich man's purse, and let loose the poor man's curse, you instructed
Pharaoh, Senacherib, and Rabsheka in the way ofblasphemy, and from those
Hellish presidents their wickedness is daily impiously imitated, Shimei was
one of your Anathema profound Scholars, and from you he learned to curse the
Lords Anointed extempore: once (as I have read) you were so addicted to peace
and unity that you made Herod and Pilate friends, who were hateful enemies,
but afterward your Hypocrisy was found, that it was your plot to destroy
innocence: you made Demas to forsake the Truth, and embrace the World (your
wicked sister:) you have never been unprovided of a kennell of Whores, Queans,
and Concubines, to tempt and draw the wisest men to folly, and for him that is
most strong (in his own opinion) you have always one darling sin or other
to fit his disposition, constitution, inclination, or humor, that like a
Dalilah shall weaken him, or quite overthrow him.

And this shall suffice for the second Ierke.
THirdly and lastly, you know that your end draws nigh, and therefore now you
rave, rage, and are more mad then ever you were, you know that after Doomsday,
that you shall have no more power over Mortals, then you shall be for ever
chained in your Den like a Dog in a Kennell; and therefore now you with all
double diligence, do endeavor to do your best to do your worst, and as much
as in you lies, you draw us from bad to worse, and from worse to worst. The
Hypo crite (by your intcitement) does vizard all his villainy, with the mask or
veil of virtue; he follows the steps of Ananias and Saphira to a hair, he
with his sower look shrowds a lofty mind. You have scatterd pride into as
many shapes as Proteus, so that a proud fashion hunter (if either money or
credit will furnish him) will transform himself into as many forms as you
can do; our Roarers (who by your pestiferous favor are styled the damned crew)
are so given to most unhallowed meditation, that they lie a bed almost till
Dinner time to study new oaths, to vent at this Ordinary, at Bowls,
Cock-fighting, Horse-race, Whore-house, or any other place of Gentleman like or
noble exercise; and as you have taught them to swear without fear, so they
do often forswear without shame: although sometimes they hazard their ears,
as they do their souls. Youset bad Projectors (and unprofitable) a work, as
thick as Crab-lice or Caterpillars, and it is no doubt but you will deal so
justly with them, that you will pay them their wages, and after you have set
them a gog (with a vengeance) to do injury with a mischief. You are so
skillful in Physic, that you have made too many believe that the loss of a
Mayden-head is an approved and speedy Medicine for the Green sickness. Poets,
Painters (and some few Courtiers) you have so well taught that they can flatter
most artificially with Pen, Picture, and by word of mouth.

It is long of you that what ever the Choplin and the Chaplin liath, yet the
thin-check'd Chiplin has nothing at all. I know a poor Curate that comes and
goes a mile every Sunday, be it Winter or Summer, all manner of weathers,
sometimes wet to the skin, and preaches once a week (on Sundays) for bare five
pound a year, the Tithe being valued at fix y pound per annum, so that the
miserable Stipend or Hireling wages will hardly buy wood to make a fire for him
when he comes home to dry him, when he s through wet. This is your work (
Monsieur Diabola) for it is your inspiration to put such wrangling spirits into
Impropriatours, that for the not paying of a tenth Pudding or a tithe Egg the
Law must take his course. You have brought the Schismatic Separatist to be
as unconformable as your self, for (like you) they cannot bide theCrosse or
the sign of it (if it be not upon money) and you have made them as unmannerly
as your self, for they will not move a Hat, or Bow a Knee at the Name of our
Savior, and they are waxed as slovenly as you can make them, for they hate
clean Linen, and all order, neatness and decency in the Church; And you have
long practiced a politic slight, which is, that when a Reverend Pastor is
painfully and carefully preaching to his Audience, instructing them how to
avoid your snares and traps; then you are so angry and impatient when you are
told of your faults, and hear your damnable devices laid open, that you could
afford to pull the Preacher out of the Pulpit by the ears, or to tear him in
pieces, but that he is so happy that you have no power over him: your
inveterate malice being limited, curbed, and snaffled by an unresistable High
and omnipotent power, and he very well understands and knows in whose service
he is, and whose Embassage he delivers, and therefore is so valiant that he
neither fears or cares a rush for you; which your imperial malevolence
perceiving, you have another trick for him, which is to lull the people asleep,
(of which number many times the best of the Parish are some) by which means you
do debar them of what they should hear, and in the mean time, the Preacher
speaks to the bare walls. And I am persuaded that is against your will, that
there is any good Preacher living, and seeing they do live (in despite of you)
and that by their care and industry they do now and then violently pluck a
soul from you, in revenge thereof you chiefly seek their confusion, either by
war, slander, or starving them through want of means. Yet this much may be
spoken as one of your good parts, which is, that you were never known to be
drunk, and though you never walk uprightly, yet you never stumbled, you were
never so fox'd but you knew the way home (and the troth is, you are so bold,
that you would make every place your home.) The Court, the City, the Country,
the Palace, the Castle, the Cottage, and the Church and all, you are so
audacious either to enter them by force, or else to insinuate and sneak into
them by craft and subtilty. And though you are no drunkard, yet you do love
the whole Rabble of them so well, that you are unwilling to lose one of them
all, but my hope is better. For if they leave it and mend their manners as they
should do, the Devil the one of them you are like to have. You have the art to
make great Scholar to learn Retrograde, for if a man be never so good a
Grammarian, and has Greek and Latin as perfect as Homer or Virgil, yet (if he
be married) you do too often teach his wife the way to read him backward,
like an Hebrician, and though he be never so well skild in learned Volumes, and
the seven liberal Arts, yet she puts him again into his Horn-book. You have
so much Devotion in you, that you do assist those Brethren that do pray
zealously, that they may be disobedient with a safe conscience, and you make
them so stout and valiant that some of them are more able to do more service
in a white sheet then the honestest man in a whole Shire can do. You know that
the Projector would be an honest man if he did not keep company with himself,
therefore you might do somewhat to be talked off, if you would separate him. It
is a scurvy fashion of your devising, that wisemen in Russet, must reverence
and stand bare to silken fools; but to conclude, you have gotten such a
freedom that you have a finger in all Trades, and an Oar in every man's Boat,
nor was there ever any bad thought, word, or deed, imagined, spoken, or
committed since the Creation, but you were at the middle and both ends of it;
and I do remember that I have read how once you bragged, boasted and promised
to give all the kingdoms of the world to be worshipped, and afterward you were
in that poor roguish case, that you were feign to ask leave to take
possession of a silly Hog. In which manner of vainglorious oftentation,
bragging and boasting, the most part of men are expert, and to promise much,
and perform nothing, is so easy a lesson of your teaching, that many great
men are more ready and perfect in it then in their Pater nester. And now you
Grand Master of mischief, you may trusse up your hose, for at this time my Pen
is worn blunt, my Inkhorn dry and myself weary with jerking, where correction
is in pain, and no possibility of no amendment.

Thus after the expense of much money, and ten weeks time, having ridden 645
miles (of sandry measures and sizes) all weary and almost monylesse, I returned
to London on Friday the twentieth of September, 1639.

FINIS.
