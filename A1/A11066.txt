The Rote or myrour of consolacyon and comfort.
PEr multas tribulaciones oportet introire in regnum dei. Thus says the
apostole saint Poule in the book of acts and deeds / that is to say in
english. By many trybulaco^ns we must enter in to ye kingdom of god
wherefore all those which intend to com in to the kingdom of heaven must
pacyently take temporal trybulacyon. For that is the way thither by the
ordinance of god. And those yt moest pacyently take there trybulaco^n / they
shall have ther^ most consolacyon. For say nt Poule says in the second
Epistle to the Corynthes. Sicut socu sumus passionis. sic erimus consolacionis.
That is to say. Like as we are parteners in trybulacyons so shall we be
parteners in Joye and consolacyon. Thus trybulacyon is bitter / but the end
that hit brings to is most sweet and delectable. And remembrance of that
everlasting swetenes makes faithful souls swetely to take matter of
trybulacyon.

Temporal aduersyte and trouble profyteth no thing to the reward of eternal
Joye but if it be pacyentely taken. Thus pacyence makes trybulacyon
profitable. And the profit of temporal prosperyte comes of the virtue of
mekenes whereby prosperyte is little set by. The parfyte pacyente heart makes
much of aduersyte. And the parfyte meke heart sets little by temporal
prosperyte / and little Joyeth therein but rather soroweth / because he fereth
that he uses not parfeytly acordynge to the great pleasure of god the goods of
this prosperyte. If thou ask me why our lord will give these temporal goods
to such as he knows yt are wretched sinners and use them evil. I answer.
One cause is to show his parfyte and habonda^t goodness which gives good
things not only to such as be good / but also to such as are evil and
wretched sinners. And to give us example to follow him in doing good for evil
/ as he byddeth in the gospel of Matthew. Love your enemies says he / and do
well to such as do evil to you and pray for such as pursue you and speak
evil of you. For ye do thus than ye may know that ye are parfyte in virtue
like as your fader in heaven is parfyte and makes the son to give light as
well to the evil men as to the good men. And makes the vnryghtwysse men to
have profit of the rain as well as the ryghtwysse. And this is a great
comfort to take pacyently trybulacyon. For if we will for the love of god
break our one froward heart and for to win ye love of god and love such as
trouble us and pray for them / and do good against evil / tha^ we have one of
the gretest tokenes that we are parfyte in the sight of god as his own
children / and folowers of him / which thing if we will remember us is most
Joyful to us. Also it makes us more pacyent if we duly remember ye goods
that we have resceyued of god / the goods of nature / as wit / eloquence /
seblenesse of body / health / beauty and goods of fortune / as gold / silver
/ clothe / lyuelode and how we have myspended them synfully / and how pacyently
he has suffered us long time to abide in sin to the intent that fynaly
remembryn ge his goodenes / his pacyence / and long sufferynge / we should
turn to him / wherefore when he stowe geth us if we remember how well we have
deserved hit we shall by his grace more parfytly be again hit. Our lord gyued
good things / as health / richesse and prosperyte to evil men and wymen / yt
remembryng his kyndenesse they should be the more moeued to penance and
sorynesse when they see they have offen ded so kind a lord which so gentelly
calls the^ of his great goodness. And he sends oftymes trybulaco^n to good
folk which are not parfytly good for they take not thankefully trybulaco^n /
but some time grudge under the rod of chastyseme^t wherefore he keeps them
still under the rod till they be so acustomed therewith yt they can take it
pacyently. Thus by his kyndenesse he bryngyth evil folk to penance / and by
his sharpness he brings good folk to pacyence. Also he gives prosperyte
and goods of this world to good men and wymen to nourysshe them and cheryshe
them in his love / like as the fader tells the child to follow him by a
fair appell / he sends also trybulaco^n to evil folk to make them dread
him. And thus the good folk he brings to love by worldely prosperyte. And
evil folk he brings to dread by aduersyte.

ONe cause why our lord will that good folk have aduersyte and trybulacyon is
this / because that evil folk shall not think that trybulacyon is so evil
that our lord accepts hit naught ne loves them which hate hit for they see
the contrary that those which be most in virtue have most trybulacyon / as
our savior wiche never did sin had most bitter pain and trouble. Also
his blessed mother / his apostles and his dyscyples. And like wise now in these
days such folk as our lord loves best such he sends most sorrow in
there heart / and most pain or labor in body / with the which in the
beginning they grut che / but finally they are taught to suffer hit swetly and
to give thankynges to our lord thereof / which by trybulacyon delyuereth them
from great sin / and brnngeth them to great grace in this world / and
ordeyneth for them plentefully the pleasure perpetually and glory of the life
that is to come.

He gives also the goods of this life to such as be wretched and sinful
lyuers after their own will and not after the will and law of god / because
that good men and wymen shall not set their heart to much on these goods which
they see that wretched people have with the hatred of god / but that they shall
love those goods most which have none but such as be good / and are
specyaly beloved of our lord. And these are the goods of virtue which bring
us to the habondau^ce richesse of ye ryall empire of heaven. The good souls set
little by the vain prosperyte of this world for hitis transytorye and rather
occasyon of vice than of virtue / and shey see that they are given to them
only well to dyspense and that they have no lordshyp in them but only use and
that they shall be straytely examyned and give acounte how they have used them
/ and by the ryghtfull Jugeme^t of god they shall have great punysshement in
this life or after this life for every thing yt they myspende / wherefore these
faithful souls have more fere than favor / more pain tha^ pleasure in great
possessyon of worldely goods / they are not inflate ne exalte in themself by
pride in prosperyte. For among great possessyon of worldely and bodily goods
they find themself right poor in the goostly goods / wherefore if the
worldely prospe ryte rychesses and honors be taken fro them they are not cast
down by sorrow / for they know that our lord has lent it them only as
long as it pleseth him / wherefore when the worldely goods goo they think it
is of his ordinance which ordeyneth every thing to the best to such souls
as are willing to live according to his will with an obedyent heart / these
know that it is for the best that he takes them away and therefore they
bliss him / wherefore loss of worldly prosperyte troubled little ye souls of
good folk / ye synful folk think yt they are very lords of temporal goods
/ and that they may spend them after there own pleasure having little regard
or none to the will of god. And in these goods they put they most felycyte
and pleasure / wherefore they be high and proud in possessyon of these and in
loss of them they are cast down in to great sorrow and pain / and the more
sorrow they have in loss of them / the more corrupt and vycyous love they
had in having of them. Our lord also gives wordely goods to sinful folk
/ for if he should stryke every sinful man and woman with the stroke of sharp
trybulacyon as soon as they had sinned / than they should thyuky that all
sin were punysshed in this life / and that there were no punysshement for
sin ordained after this life wherefore our lord suffers many one for to live
in this life after their own pleasure / and to multeplye sin at there pleasure
and to his great dysplesure / having no punysshement in this world by cause
we shall understand yt it is reserved to the other world / for god is so
ryghtful that he may leave no sin unpunished / wherefore ^ythen these sy^ners
are not punysshed in this world / there must need punysshement be done after
this world. And hit shall be to hard to abide ye trybulaco^n / wherefore well
is them that have in this life their trybulacyon / for this is little or naught
in regard of that. Also some sinners in this life have great trybulaco^n and
punysshement / and specially such as be commonly known of wretched living /
and one cause is that other shall be aferde to follow them by example of
living / and an other is that we may see in this life that god takes great
dysplesure with the life of such as be wretched. if he should punysshe no
sin in this life / than hit should be thought that he little forsed of the
life of man / ne gave none attendaunce thereto. Also if he would give no
temporal goods to such as ask them of him hit should seem that they were
not in his power. And if he should give temporal goods to echone that asks
them vndstandynge that they be so greatly desired in this life / the people
would rather serve him for goods of this life than for goods of the life to
come / wherefore to some he gives prosperyte / and to some he gives aduersyte
Wherefore such as ask temporal prosperyte and resceyue hit of our lord they
may see that he may give hit / but if they set their heart more on hit than on
the prosperyous life to come / they shall never after this life have prosperyte
but perpetual trybulacyon and aduersyte. Also such as be lovers of god and
virtue and have in this life pain and aduersyte / our lord has ordained in ye
life to come to have great prosperyte. And such as he sees that should be
blyndeth with temporal prossperyte / he sends them themporall aduersyte / by
cause that they should little make of this life where as they suffer so great
trybulacyon / and make much of that life whereby they shall resceyue the great
prosperyte of that flourynge felicite that never shall fade by aduersyte / but
ever be a like fres he without end in eternyte. Thus who so will have that
prosperyte they must take pacyently and thankefully this aduersyte. For the
profit of pain and trybulaco^n is in the manner of well taking thereof. The
good thief and the evil thief the which were crucefyed with our savior
suffered one manner of pain / but the good thef took it faithfully and pacyently
and therefore hit brought him to the paradyse The evil thief took hit not
faithfully ne pacyentely and therefore hit nothing did profit to him to
deliver him fro sin and to procure grace for to bring him to glory.
Oftentyme the pains that diverse persons suffer is like but the taking of
hit is not like / therefore one person is purged by pain and the other is
broken and hurt thereby / for that one takes hit pacyently and thanketh god
thereof / and that other grutcheth therewith and forgeteth god / and so the pain
that they ^uffre is like / but the sufferers are not like / for that one has
virtue with the pain / and that other has vice / like as in one fire gold
glystereth and the grene block smoketh / and under one fleyle the whete is
purged and the chaf is broken / so one manner of pain or trybulacyon purges
the pacyent / and fyleth and destroys the impatient. The good man or good
woman loves and thanketh god thereof for hit is his work / and they pray to
him that hit may stand them for their purgatory / for allmaner synet comes
of vice / and al manner pain comes of god to the more profit of those that
desyren to love him more than all the wit of mortal man can tell / the
evil man or woman grutcheth with god and thinks little what profit yt he
has ordained to them by pain and trybulacyon.

THere is no temporal pain that any christian soul suffers in this life but
they deserve hit well and much more both for offenses that they do in
themself and also against their neighbors. There is no man neither no woman
the which lives so Innocently and so vertuousely in this life / but many
times they offen de doing not after right and reason / but after the evil
desire of their flesh. Not with standing that by special grace of our
lord there are full many the which live long time without dedely sins and
do no great myscheuous deeds / for which myscheuous deeds and for
punysshement of yt which our lord fulfylleth the word with great battle /
pestylence / and great hongre / and many great trybulacyons / and yet they can
not excuse them but they do many venyall sins the which deserve more
punyssheme^t of the rygoure of ryghtwysnesse than any that is felede in this
life. And if it were so that any man or woman lived without sin of themself
/ yet they live not without sin in daily couersaco^n with their neighbors /
for with their neighbors they live not always as they should do excytynge them
to virtue by words and example. Also when they here or see them offend they
correct them not as they ought to do by broderly charity. For sometime of
ydelnesse they will not study how they might say or do to the correc cyon of
their neighbor. And sometime they are a shamed to speak to them ferynge that
they should be rebuked again / other in like things or in worse / or for
couetyse that they fere if they should speak they should dysplese / and by that
they should lose such things as they desire to have or they should lose
thereby such things as they have. Nevertheless every man is not bound to
correct other folk when he sees them offend / for peradventure if he speak
openly to him among many he should make him worse than he was before /
wherefore if his mind give him that he might more profit at an other time /
than he may without ofence cese till such a time that he think he should
more profit. But every man that sees his neighbor offend and demed in his
mind that by his speech he might reform him / he is bound to speak ta his
reformacyon. And by cause they do not so notwithstanding they live
virtuously to them self / yet they deserve to have pain and trybulacyon
according to the ryghtwysnesse of almighty god wherefore every man ought
pacyently to take trybulacyon for the right wysnesse of god will yt hit be so
for causes the which oftymes are known only to him.

TRybulacyon for hit self is not to be desired but for the profit that
grows thereof and for the special help that the soul has thereby / for ye
sinful soul is reformed and restored to the love of god by the well taking
of trybulacy on / wherefore that soul which has offended god and would be
glad to win his love / again / hit may be glad when he sends hit
trybulacyon and pain for thereby they may win his love. And for this cause
says the prophet David. Da nobis dne auxiliu^ de tribulacione. Lord help us
by trybulacyon / he says not give us trybulacyo^ / but give us help by
trybulacyon. As no man will desire a bitter drink but only for the help that
he may have thereby / if he trust that he may have his bodily life thereby he
will he right glad to drink hit be hit never so bitter rather than he should
bodily dye Like wise a synful soul that has deserved eueria stynge death
should be right glad to drink a sharp draught of trybulacyon for to be
delivered there by fro ye endelesse pain of everlasting death. Thus to wise
folk in god which ordeyne all their life pryncypally to god / tribulacyon
death great profit And to wise folk of the world that put their most
pleasure in this world and little remember the life that is to come /
trybulacyon does great hurt / for hit is so sore against their will which our
lord sends to their health and profit to make them set little by this
world that our lord is wroth with them / and so by the dysobedyent taking
of this temporal trybulacio^ they deserve to have everlasting trybulacyo^n.
Thus every man if he will may have great help and profit by trybulacyoon. And
this god will: thou shall have the sooner if you remember how precious this
virtue of pacyence is in ye sight of god / and how profitable hit is to the
soul without which no virtue pleases god in the ne profyteth the. Than
think that thou can lose no bodily things whose loss is troublous to the /
that is so profitable as pacyence which thou losys if thou take not easily thy
trybulaco^n. And so learn to conforte thyselfe within in that you felest
thyselfe dyscon forteth without / for if thou take pacyently aduercyte and
things done against thy will / thou gettest more richesse Inwardly in thy soul
/ than is possible to the to lose outwardly. And of all gladness that is the
most precious and acceptable to god the which grows of trybulaco^n and is
one of ye most gladness yt you can have yt you haste an holy soul / but this
gladness none may have but such as know ye fruit and profit of trybulaco^n
which ye may learn in part by redynge of this treatise of trybulaco^n / and
specially if ye emprynte well the sentence thereof in your mind / for like as
evil chawed mete profyteth little nature / so light redynge with little at
tendannce of the sentence profyteth little the soul.

THere are. xx. fruytes the which comes of trybulacyon well taken. The first
is that trybulacyon well taken as the work of our lord to reformacyon of the
soul / keeps the good soul in the state of grace fro the hondes of the
enemies thereof / and hit rescueth and delyuereth the evil soul fro the
enemies. These enemies that are sub pressyd and dysco^fet by trybulaco^n / are
ye falls Joys of this world and dysceyuable prosperytees of flesshely pleasure
/ which take as prisoners ye hertes of me^ and wymen that be without
dyscyplyne and conning of virtuous living to bataylle right with these
flesshely pleasures / they are so dysceyuable for they show as they were
fre^des and they are enemies / they show they would bring to great pleasure /
but finally they bring to great pain sorrow and destruccyon These are the
enemies that foles of this life desire to be conuersaunt withal / and they
take them not as enemies / but as true friends and helpers / they make so
fair contenau^ce and pretense of favor / and yet they entende to kylle and
destroy as Joab capteyn to the people of king Dauyd took ye man Amas by ye
chynne and laughed on him as he had been his friend by cause he should not have
him suspecte / and with that other hand he thurst him into the belly with a
dagger. Thus when worldly prosperyte laughed on a man yt he has all things to
his pleasure / than he stands in most Jeopardy to lose ye love of god that is
verry life to the soul / for than he shall be drawn to many vices / and
therefore prosperity is more to be dread than aduersyte in that hit desceyueth
traytoursly / like as the enemy that hurts secretly by dysceyte is more to
be dread that he yt assoyleth openly. Trybulaco^n is not only in loss of
goods / loss of friends / loss of health / loss of lyberte* but hit is also
in loss of transquylyte and peace of mind which a soul has that is in great
temptaco^n and battle against the world / the flesh / or the devil. Of all
troubles hit is most when a soul is troubled to do a thing contrary to the
pleasure of god whom hit desires of all thing to please. Trybulaco^ns are not
only send fro god to those that entende to serve and please god / but himself
ledeth the oost of trybulaco^ns as captain and marchall of the oost to ordeyne
them so wisely that they shall be to the socour and rescu of his friends. And
so he says by the prophet. Cu^^p^o sum in trybulacione eripiam eu^. I mine
own self says our lord am with Him that is troubled and I shall deliver
him. And specially he is with them in temptaco^n and trybula co^n that put
their pryncypaly hope of help in him As he says. Qm^ in me sperauit liberabo
eum. By cause he has trusts in me says our lord I shall deliver him. Than
you that haste almighty gods help in thy trybulaco^n and abiding with ye to
help the when the trybulaco^n does assoyle the / resort than with hearty
desire to the presence of thy lord god / besechynge him for grace to take hit
so that he may be pleased with the / and thou to have special help against
thyn adversaries by ye good taking of trybulacyo^ and sythen our lord comes
to the tribulaco^n / the more thy trybulacion grows theby more nygh he
draws to ye. But peraue^tu re you wylt say here. Sir the presence of
trybulacyo^ I feel / but the presence of my lord god which as the prophet
says bears me felyshyp in trybulacio^ I feel not / for if he made me feel
ioyfulnesse of heart by his presence like as trybulacio^ makes me to feel
bytternesse of heart. I should be well content to suffer trybulacio^ / and
gladly I would resceyue hit. Also an other thing stoneth me greatly for before
ye trybulaco^n came / and things contrary to my will I had more feeling in
god and more pleasure as it seems me than in ye time of trybulaco^n. How is it
tha^ that in tribulaco^n he is more nygh to me and I less feel him / for a
solucyon of this doubt you shall understand that you haste ye presence of god
where ever thou be / for ye presence of god his dyuynyte fulfylleth heaven and
earth as he says by ye prophet Jeremye. Celum and terra^ ego impleo. Wherefore
thou ought to be right well auysed in every corner what thou do or what thou
say for thou haste thy* Juge present that shall dampne the or save ye but
specially he is prese^te with the when thou art in his grace and growest in
virtue. As wha^ thou feleste that by great temptacyon and trybulacyo^ thou
set less by the worldely vanyte and by thy life / and gyuest the more to
prayers / fasting / watchynge / alms deed doing / pylgremage going to
redy^ge of good books of virtue / of holy medytacyons / to have thy mind more
contained to god with will to serve him better / wha^ thou felest these profytes
grow in the than thou felest our lord gostely. These profytes our lord
makes by te^ptacyon and trybulacyon as saint Poule says. Be n^dictus deus qui
facit cu^ temptacione prouentu^. Blessed be god that werketh by temptaco^n
profit. Thou wylt say peradventure that thou haste hurt sometime by
trybulacyo^s / for sometime thou fallest by temptacyon and love virtue. I
answe to this / that if thou have a will finally to do well or would have a
will to do well which is one of ye great tokens thou shall be the child of
salvation / than standing thou be ye elect and chosen child of god / what
someuer happen to the thou shall have well thereby / not withstanding that thou
do dedely sin yet our lord shall work a weyle the upon. As the apostle
says Diligentibus dn^m oia coopant^ in bonu^ hus qui sc^m propositu^ vocati
sunt sancti To such as love god all thing retorneth to their weyle / and
specially to such as are the elect childern of god / or for such as be the
chosen chyldern of god after they have fallen in to dedely sin / they feel in
themself rumors and bytternesse of consyence / they will be confessed thereof
/ they set less by themself seeing they are but wretched sinners. They set
less by dygnytees and worshyppes of this world / for they think themself be
worthy to have no worshypes / but rather to have great shame and rebuke / they
set less by rich reparell and clothing. They set less by costely and
delycate fedy^nge of the body / for they thy^ke they have deserved rather
bodily pain than pleasure. Also seeing how they were brought to sin / they
are more wise to avoid such occasyons herafter. Also they love god more that
after their fall takes them to grace again / and of very love they dread more
to offend him. And thus many that fall tosynne come to more grace than some
yt have not such fall like as Mary magdaleyn / in heaven above is ma^y that
keped in this life co^tynually their virgynyte I say not this to give comfort
to any soul for tosynne in hope that they shall come to more grace. For who
comes to such grace and who not / it is not in themself but in god. And not
withstanding many come to such grace after great sin. Yet those that
continue in Innocencye may have this grace and much more in that that they
are vel occupied the time that the other were wretchedly occupied by sin. And
so that time they win upon them that fall. Also our lord is feled by
consolacyon and by comfort which he sends ye time of trybulacyon. Many a
soul is lost without caunseyll and conforte of man which our lord of his
great mercy suddenly does comfort / that they think for the time the trouble
is clean gone fro them. The apostle says. Sicut passio^es xp^i habundant in
nobis. sic pro xp^m habundat and consolacio nostra. Like as the pains of
christ habo^de in us / so habondeth in us consolacyon by him and such as have
sinned / when they have grace of tee res and weeping for their sins / with
the same ryseth a spyrytuell Joye in god yt which gives the^ such grace to
be sorry for their sy^nes. As saint Austen says / the sinner soroweth for sin
/ and of his sorrow he does Joye. Every soul that conteyneth in virtuous
living ought to be content though he feel no great goostly swetnesse / for
como^ly our lord sends hit to such as he sees are wek to bear great labor
and temptacyons / and by hit he comfort them as by milk the child is
nourysshed But such as be myghtely grown in grace and in virtue he sends
them fedynge by bitter te^ptacyons and trybularyo^s / as saint Poule says
Perfecto^ est solidus cibus qui habe^t sensus exercitatos ad discrecione^ bom
et mali. And the more a soul has of goostly swetnesse in this life / so much
lesser hit shallhaue in the life to come. As he that takes part of his
wageafore his term day the less he shall receive when his term day comes
Such ofte^tyme as our lord loves best / he sends lest goostly delectacyon
but leueth the^ only to their mighty faith and by that to good werker of
living. For in this lyfehe keeps p^uy his love because he will keep them
low yt they shall not make to much of themself. And yet to some which he
loves specially he sends great sweetness in goostly feeling of him and by
wondre reuelacyons. And oftentyme more to the profit and to quycke^ other to
his service and faith which known not such wondre workings than to the
profit of themself. But after this life he will make openly known to all the
world every deed of virtue. And what great te^ptacyons they have resysted for
the love of him. He lets not the troubled soul always neither oftentyme feel
his presence by goostly swetnesse by cause he will keep it low and in fere /
for the more low that a soul makes himself / and the less that hit sets
by himself and thinks that it is so wretched yt it is not worthy to have any
goostly comfort of god / the more our lord makes of him / and ye more glory
and Joye theris ordey^ed to him. For as he says. Omnis qui se humiliat
exaltabitur Every person that meketh himself he shall be exalted. And thus
many a soul grows in virtue and little perceived it as by any goostly
swetnesse. But who so might have a little taste of the parfyte delectacyon to
the which he shall be brought by trybulacyon if he take it well. He should not
complain but Joye of tribulacyon. As saint Poule says? Gloriamur in spe
filio^ dei et non solum in hoc sed in tribulacione scientes qm^ tribulacio
paciencia^ operat^. pacientia probacione^ probacio spem spes autem non
confundit quia caritas dei diffusa est in cordibus nostris We Joye says he not
only that we hope to be the child of god and Inherytours of his Joye / but we
Joye also in trybulacyon / knowing that tribulacyon makes a pacyent herteyf
it be well taken / and pacyence of heart is the great proof that a person is
the very chosen child of eleccyon / and after that proof comes hope of
salvation / not as of our merytes but by the grace of god / which is yielded in
to our hertes by the holy ghost which is given to us. The great comfort
comes not fro god to such a time as the place be made ready for hit in the
soul / and the herberers which take and dress this lodging are trybulacyons
/ as it is written in the book of Thobye. Post lacrimacionem et fletu^
exultacione^ infundis After trybulacyon and we pynge thou sendest comfort and
Joye. Than if thou have great labors and business with these herberers think
hit well spente for they will quy te hit one of these days. And great
trybulacyon makes rome and place for grette Joys / hit is decreed and
determined as alawe by the great wisdom of god / that first he shall come to
his dear beloved children with trybulacyon to deliver them fro the false Joys
of this world / and after he shall dwell with them by true Joye where as they
shall have no need of trybulacyo^ for to exclude the false Joye s. But before
that he come with very true Joye he will make the heart by trybulacyon and
temptacyon to set naught by all ye false Joys of this world. When as
trybulacyon is passed and has made an holy place by pacyence and by meekness
than comes in Joye. But peradventure thou complaynest and say. Sir it is
long or this consolacyon comes. A this is the complaynte of lovers / what
thing so ever hit is that is gretely beloved the deferring thereof is
paynfull. And not withstanding that if hit be never so sharply hasted yet
hit is thought very long in coming. As Solomon says. Spes que differtur
affligit anima^. When as a man has hope for to have a thing that he loves
the deferring of hit is bitter to the soul. Also peradventure thou will reason
to me this. Sir I meruayll not that wretched me^ and wymen which set all their
heart and pleasure in wretched living / and spend there time not profytabli but
occupye all about sins and vanytees of this world / though these have
trybulacyon and see ye try bulaco^n is profitable to them which are fallen in
the hondes of their enemies / as these be to draw them fro there hondes and
make them flee sin and wretched living. But to such as live holyly and do
no great sin. I meruayll why these have great trybulacyo^ / for they fall
not so in the hondes of theyrenemyes as the other do. To this I answer that
our lord delivered from the false Joys of this world both sinners and also
the Innocents which should be taken with them except his grace preuoked them
by trybulacyon and temptacyon / and preserved them fro these false sinful
Joys / also an other wise our lord rescues his enemies and other wise his
friends. For he rescues his enemies fro trybulacyon delyuerynge them when they
are taken of their enemies. But his friends he delyuereth sendynge them help
by trybulacyons that they come not in to the hands of their enemies. And so
both are holden to laud and to thank god both the sinful which by
pacyence and great trybulacyon is drawn fro sin to virtuously uynge and
little setting by all the false worldely Joye. And also the virtuous Innocente
which is preserved by temptacyon and trybulacion that hit is never blinded and
desceyued by that Joye. Thus no man neither woman may think that they be out
of the love of our lord by trybulacyan / but rather think that they are
specially beloved of him the which sends them trybulacyon to keep or to
deliver them fro false desceyuable plesures of this world and from the
Inordynate and foul delytes of the flesh. These pleasures are called false /
for they are full sweet in the beginning but they end with great bytternesse
and sorrow. As Solomon says Extrema gauditluctus occupat. The end of wordely
Joye is occupied with weeping and sorrow. A thou wise gracyous man and
womanbeware of this false worldely Joye / yt thou be not brought to great
sorrow thereby. Thou see hit is butlytell and after hit shall follow sorrow of
Inestymable gretnesse / hit is but short but it has a long tail of sorrow
that neuershall have end. Hit is no hole Joye for hit is meddled with sorrow.
As Solomon says. Risus dolor miscebytur. The laughing Joye of this world is
meddled with many matters of sorynes. Those which thou thynkest have most of
worldely Joys they have much sorrow / trouble / and labor with them. They
are so bitter to a parfyte heart that feeling them ones vit would never have
them if it might have them per petually. They go fast away but the sorrow
that follows upon them shall ever abide. A this is a false Joye where is so
little pleasure and so great pain and goth so swyftly away and never shall
come again wherefore I exhort you all which would have ye love of our lord and
continue a virtuous ly fe that ye thankefully welcome trybulacyons as your
defenders fro your great enemies / which tri bulacyons are send from our
lord as his knight to defend you. And think that your expe^ses made in them
shall stand you in great service. And if ye can not welco^e hertely these
soudyoures of our lord yet chyde not with them nor malynge not against them /
for if ye fight with them ye fight with your fre^des and that is a peryllous
battle where a man puts no dyfference betwixt his friend and his enemy.
The Joys of this world I say are enemies to the soul and bring hit to
sin and perdycyon. Troubles of this world / sekenes / and pay^e are friends
to the soul for they draw hit from sin Wherefore if thou hate thy friends
and love thyn enemies thou see what Jeoperdy you stand in / wherefore say
welcome my friend trybulacyon / and fie of erthely Joye

THe second consolacyon and fruit in trybulacyon is to remember how the heart
is closed up fro vanytees whereby hit stops the eeres of the soul so that
hit may not here the callynges and the mocyons of te^ptacyon as other do which
feel no trybulacyons. For in such hertes as do flower in prosperyte / the
vain pleasure of the world does keep there perleament at lyberte. And those
hertes give attendaunce and withstudye apply them how they may atteyne to
fulfill the desires of worldly plesures in maky^ge of goodly bil dynge and of
goodly facyons of clothes and to be well acompanyed with goodly servants. And
to gydre tresoure to be called rich / and to come to honor and dygnyte / and
to be much set by / and to be called fair in face / and goodly in body.
These vain and transytorye plesures do so replenysshe and fulfill the soul
with such mocyons that in manner hit forgeteth himself / both in time of
prayer and when hit should be virtuously occupied / hit is so a customed to
take heed and attend to the spekynges of these deceyuable plesures that in
manner hit has no pleasure to here things profitable to the pleasure of god and
the perpetual weyle of the soul. But when trybulacyon comes / all this vain
speech cesseth as the mocyons of vain plesures are withdrawn. This is fygured
and sygnefyed in the book of Job where hit is said the time that he was in
great trybulacyon. Nemo loquebatur ei verbu^ videbant enim dolorem eius
vehementem. The friends that came to Job when they see him have so great pain
and trybulacyon they spoke no word to him. By these friends are sygnefyed ye
te^ptacyons of prosperity which make pretense by the plesaunt semblau^ce and
co^tenau^ce they show to the soul that they were very friends and they are
very traitors for they cesse not till they have brought the soul to much
sorrow oftentimes in this world. And if there follow no sorrow and penance in
this world there follows dampnacyon with perpe tuall pain and tourment after
this world in hell with the deuylles which most labor to make the hertes
most to love ye temporal prosperyte of this life / and the world and the
flesh do help the devil to make the soul to set the love in prosperyte of
this life which should be fixed of the felicyte of the everlasting life / for
all ye time yt it shall abide here is granted hit to learn to set little by the
vain Joys and plesures of this life. For by the ordynau^e of god the less
hit sets by the Joys of this worcester de the more hit shall have of those most
excellent and eternal Joys in heaven. what our lord of his special grace
se^deth trybulaco^n. These Joys are little set by and therefore they dare not
speak lest they should be forsaken for ever / and therefore as in this time
they go away as astoned and a shamed. O than this trybulacyon is of great
auctoryte which stops the mouth of ye vayn plesures of the world. Than
lecherye is set onlyde she dare nor spekefor her speech in that time is no
thing set by. Like wise glotonye and pride / for as that time the heart
delyteth another in delyctable mete and dry^ke ne in fresshe clothes. Than the
eyes of the soul which were blinded with prosperity that it another see
himself ne god / now they are opened and can dyscerne that all is but
wretchedness in this world / and that theris no true love but ye love of god
and virtue / and than it fereth god. And than hit called besely for his help
and makes many a good purpose and promise to amend the life and to do things
to his pleasure. Thou shall understand her^ that what manner of spekynges the
temptaco^ns make in thy soul other by thoughts or ymagynaco^ns contrary to
the soul which sometime seem abhomynable and shamfull / fere thou no thing as
long as thou answerest not to them saying ye be consenting but nay by
dyscenty^ge of. For as long as ye co^sentes not to ye thought be they never so
erronus or never so abhomynable they shall nothing hurt the to the decresse of
thy merit. This is fygured in the books of the kings where king ysachy
commanded yt people of Jerusalem which stood upon the walls of the cite yt
they should not answer to the blasphemus speky^ges of Rapsaces which was
marchall of ye oost of king Senacheryb and seyde sege to the cite. But
peradventure you will say to me / sir how shall I know yt I consent not to my
thoughts. To this I answer / yt one toke^ is yt you conse^^^ not when you would
have them away. An other is wha^ you felest a remors / a sorowenes and a
dysplesure growing in thy^ heart of such thoughts / for this sorrow comes of
a ^traryousnes which is between thy will and thy mind / an other is when you
can find in thine heart to pray god to take them away / for
notwithstanding that they hurt ye not yet they trouble sore / abasshe and
stonysshe an Innocent soul. And as for thoughts contrary to the faith fere
them not as long as thy will is to believe as the church of god byleueth. For
tha^ ye faith of the church is thy faith / and after that thou shall be taken
and not after thy rennynge mind. Thus sythen trybulaco^n puts to silence
the great te^ptaco^ns of this world yt they dare not come nygh the troubled
soul / and opens the eyes thereof that hit may see hit self and god / and
that the worldely prosperyte is but myserye / and makes the soul to cry to
god and keeps him in mind. I counsel the to make much of aduersyte when
hit comes and thank god thereof. For he sends ever to ye for thy well and
more than thou can thynke^ and for other causes than thy mind is able to know
/ except ye haste it by reuelacyon of him.

THe third consolaco^n and comfort in trybulaco^n is to remember the profit
of trybulaco^n in purgynge of the soul fro sin and wretchenesse. Here is to
be understand yt there are five manners of purgacyons which are remenbred in
scripture. One is of the body by medycynable drink or by lettynge of blood /
and that is other by strykynge of the vein or crasynge or cuttynge of the
flesh. The second is purgynge of metal and that is other with the fyrelyke
as gold is gurged / or by furbysshynge like as iron is purged. The third is
purginge of vynes and tresse when the superfluous branches are cut away
with a knyfe or with a saw. The fourth is the purgynge of ye corn fro the
chafe with the fleyle. The fyfth is the purgynge of wine which is purge with
the pressure. For the first purgacyon which is made by dry^ke I say our
lord gives to ye this drink of trybulacyon to purge thyn heart fro corrupt
humors of worldely and flesshely love / for like as the bitter medycynable
drink purged the body / like wise trybulacyon purges the heart. wherefore
dear beloved soul I pray the drink hertely and with Joye in god in hope of
thyn endelesse saluaco^n. This drink of trybulacyon which this sovereign
phesycyen gives to the. And knows best thyn complexyo^ thyn Infyrmyte / and
what drink is most profitable to the. And this gentle phesycyan for to
comfort the in thy drinking / and for to show to the that he gives no
thing to the but which is profitable. He has begone and dronken of this
drink to the by his most paynfull and bitter passion He drank to the the
most bytterest part of this drink / for his pains were most sharpest as it
is written in the book of Trenos. Uidete si est dolor sinulis sicut dolor meus.
See ye says he / yt therbe any pain like to my pain / hit passes thy power
to drink so bitter a draught as he began to the. And standing that he is thy
fader and thy maker which gives to the this drink and has so hertely
begonnen to the himself / than thou may well think that this drink is very
profitable to the / and for this profit take it swetely. O thou world say
that if the king of very love did drink to his seruante hit were a vylenous
dedeto this servant to cast the cup down when the king offered hit him.
Like wise wha^ almighty god gives the chastysement by trybulacyon / and thou
would not take hit but with a froward heart that is in the thou cast hit
away / so much thy deed is more vylenous and oryble / as this king excedeth
all other kings / and his love to the passes all other love / and if thou
take hit hertely of his hand so much it is the more merytoryous to the / and
to the great honor and pleasure of him. Wherefore I counseyll the when he
offers to the ye cup that thou drink it of all hertely if it were ye
bytternes of death yt he did give the / for he has dronke^ that bitter draught
himself for ye / which had no thing to purge in him. wherefore you that art
full of many unclean humurs and of goostly corrupcyo^ ought hertly to drink
this dry^ke as you love thy salvation for the which this drink is send the.
And cast hit not down after the counsel of Solomon there he says. Fili
disciplina^ dm^ ne abicias. Child cast not away the dyscyply^e of
punysshement which our lord gives to the. For as he says in an other place.
Qui abicit disciplina^ infelix est. He that casts away chastysynge is
unhappy. This bitter drink our lord gives to all his friends to whom he has
ordained the sweet drink of his glory after this life. Of this drike he
speaks to saint James and to saint Joha^ when he said. May ye drink the
drink that I shall drink. All the martyrs have dronken this drink.
Confessors and holy men and wymen which now are put in possessyon of ye
endelesse and Joyful kingdom of heaven. Therefore says the prophet. Calice^
salutaris accipiam. I shall drink the wholesome drink / and if it be so bitter
that thy stomach may not well away withal / than call to our lord that
makes and gives this drink yt he will give thy power and tempre thy stomach
and appetyte hertely to take it. wherefore it follows in ye prophet Et nome^
domini inuocabo. I shall call the name of my lord god. Many there are which
in the beginning with good Instrucco^n drink this drink hertely but with a
little contenaunce they wax meruaylously weary therewith / to such I say as ye
phesycyan does. Sythen ye have dronken the more perarte lose not your health for
this little / but stele upon hit swyftly and drink hit every soap / and think
hit is the most profitable drink that ever ye drank / for in drinking of it
ye drink your health / let hit not long abide in your mouth but hastily let it
go down / for else hi^ will make the heart to have ab homynaco^n the^ with
and grudge / and than shall be loost the profit of ye werkynge / as if a man
would chew the pylles Kasy which are given him they should little profit him.
He chewech and breketh the pylles which grutche^h greatly with the trybulacyons
and chydeth and is angry with every thing for the anger nesse that he has to
his trybulacyon. Every good soul ought not only to ^ere pacyently trybulaco^n
but they should desire to have temporal tribulacio^ and there purgatory here
that they might avoid the great pains and tourme^tes which are ordained for
purgaco^n of sin after this life to such as depart in the state of grace.
As our savior for our well not only without chiding or weeping suffered the
pain of his passion but he wylfully offered himself thereto. Sometime the
phesycyan gives a good me dycyne to purge the body and hit ^oth no profit.
For the humors are so hard and not dygested the the medycyne purged not ye
nature from them. Like wise our lord sends trybulacyo^ / but the heart is
hard without pacyence and mekenes that hit nothing profyteth. Like as the
trybulacyo^ that our lord send to king Pharao no thing did profit to him /
for the more trouble he had the more proud / anger / and enuyous he was / and
so that thing which is given of our lord as medycyne to ye heart the evil
taking thereof tourneth hit to poison. An other purgacyon of the body is by
lettynge of blood / and one manner is to let out the blood by the vein / for
like as the evil blood corru^peth the good blood / like wise ^y^ne which is
lykened to evil blood corru^peth the soul and brings it to endelesse pain.
The mouth whereby this blood of sin eschew is the mouth of a penytentman or
woman wha^ by confession it puts out the sin / as Salomo^ says. Os iust^
vena vite. The mouth of the ryghtwysse man is the vein of life for thereby he
is delivered fro sin / which if he were not delivered thereof it should
bring him to endelesse death For this blood desired the prophet Dauyd to be de
lyuered when he said to our lord. Libera me de sanguinibus deus deus salutis
me. My lord god of my health deliver me fro blood / yt is to say / fro
sy^nes. And our lord said by the prophet ysaye to the people of Israel
Auerta^ oculos a vobis quia manus vestre plenesunt sanguine. I shall t^orn my
face fro you / for your hands are full of blood that it to say / your works
are full of sin / ye evil blood of the heart / that is to say sin and
evil mocyons ought to be put away / and the good blood yt is the good mocyons
ought to be kept still to nourysshynge of the heart. And like as he is a fool
yt would all his good blood should be let out and all the evil kept / so he is
a more great fool which shows out ward his good deeds by ypocresye to have
vain laud / and keeps close his evil deeds specially when he should she we
them by confession / wherefore who so will that trybulacyon pacyentely taken
shall be profitable to them / see yt they keep their soul clean by co^fessyon
/ for there is no pain that shall be rewarded in heaven except the sufferer
thereof be in the state of grace / yet it is good to a person notwithstanding
they deem yt they be in dedely sin pacyently to take pain / for the^ shall
thereby ye sooner rise to grace and their contryco^n may be so great with will
to be confessyd yt they may deserve to have grace before they come to
co^fessyon Netheles though ye contrycyon be as much as a person may have for
sin wc will to be confessyd / yet they are bound after to be confessyd thereof
ones in the year or else they sin dedely again. Confession to many a soul is
full troubelous. For some have great pain to confess them for shame yt they
have of abhomynable sins / and some think yt they never confess them
plainly enough / and also for pain of contrycyon and satysfacco^n that the
true penyte^t has it may be nombred enough trybulacyo^s. An other mean to
mynysshe blood is by garsynge and ventosynge or boxynge / and so as many
trybulacyo^s as you haste as many garsynges you haste / and so many strokes are
stry ken of thyn heart to purge hit. But like as the fles she before the
garsynge ought to be enfla^med with fire put in flexe in the vessel of glass
and so much the stroke of garsynge shall grieve the less that the flesh has been altered with ye hete before. Thus if the heart be enfla^med with the fire of
love of god hit shall the less feel the grieve of the stroke of trybulacyon.
For if the heart have the love of god it is content with his werkynge which in
this world sends trybulacyon to all those that he loved / and or deyneth in
the other world with himself to have the great consolaco^n / without this
fire of love in a dysobedyent heart the strokes of trybulacyon they are full
grievous and full of anguysshe and pain. For as saint Austen says. Omnia sena
et immania leua ac facilia amor facit. All things which are ragens and fail
love makes light and easy to bear.

Thus our lord did enfla^me the hertes of his aposteles before they suffered ye
great persecuco^n and tribu laco^n in prechynge of the faith / he sent to them
the holy ghost ye spyryte of love in symylytude of fire in token yt he had
kyndeled the fire of love in their hertes. Thus saint Peter before his heart was
heted with this love he might not bear ye word of a woman which called him one
of crystes dyscyples / but af ter that he had received ye spyryte of love he
was glad to be called so and glad to suffer his flesh to be garsed and
wounded on the cross for ye great love yt he had to our savior christ. This
love made hy^ so pacyent / that not only bitter words were sweet to him but
also bitter strokes. The great love and de sire yt he had to be with christ
made him glad to take trybulacyons / which he knew was the way to come to
christ An other purgaco^n is of metal as gold is purged in ye fire and made
more bryghter and is departed from other metal / so the fire of trybu lacyon
forms the heart and makes it more clean / and makes to depart therfro
rosty metal of sy^ne. In this fire were the martyrs and ye confessors fined
and purged as it is written in the book of wisdom. Tanque auru^ in furnace
probauit electos dominus. God has proved his elect childer by trybulacio^
like as the gold is proved by the fire. Here ye shall understand that like as
of all metals gold is the most p^cyous / so leed is most little in valdure /
and yet there may no gold be well fined without led. For the leed molten with
the gold draws to him all the matter of corrupco^n fro the gold. Thus the
good folk which are lykened to gold are purged by the evil folk which are
lykened to leed. For by great Iniuryes and wrongs yt they do to ye good folk
in word and deed they purge them fro sin for they take all the wrongs done
to them well, And by the good taking thereof thinking they have deserved such
trouble and more and thank god that sends them there purgatory in this life
/ they grow in grace and in the great favor of our lord And the wretched
people yt wrongfully trouble them and of a malycyous intent grow in the
Indygnaco^n of our lord and indette of the great pain which they shall pay
after this mortal life. Thus by persecucyons of tyrauntes were crowned the
martyrs An other wise trybulacyon purges the heart like as frobysshynge
scoureth the yrone and like as the knyfe which lies and is not occupied
rosteth / and as the sword which is not drawn out of the scaberde. So men
and wymen which rest in the plesures of this life and are not frobysshed with
shar pe trybulacyon they lose the bryghtnesse of there sou le and wax rosty by
sin. And their souls are as abhomynable in the sight of god / as there bodies
ar plesau^t in the sight of man / wherefore thou that art a faithful soul and
see thou may not have thy plesures in this world and in the life that is to
come also / grutche not greatly if our lord skoure thy^ haberton with
trybulaco^n and make the a bright sword to stryke the fendes by holy living
and wylfull taking of trybulacyon. For more pain thou can not do to the
devil than to take pain pacyently / for than he is confounded in the when he
can not by trybulacyon bring ye to Inpacye^ce / our lor de scoureth the to
make the know thy self / and to set little by thyselfe / and to know him and
make much of him which by trybulaco^n tamporal shall deliver the from all
trybulacyon eternal and bryn ge the to perpetual consolacyon. An other
purgynge is as the gardener purges the vine and other tresse by cuttynge away
of superfluous branches Of this purgacyon speaks our savior where he says.
Omne^ palmite^ in menon ferentem fructum purgabit eum. My fader shall purge
every branch which is planted in me by faith and brings forth no fruit of
virtuous life. By this vine is understand the heart of man which is fulfilled
with the humors of holy love of god and of virtue and brings forth great
fruit to the comfort of many / like as the humor in the vine makes it to
bring forth fruit. And like as the humor when it is superfluous and more
than need it is spedeth to much in branches without fruit Like wise when the
superflous love habondeth in man's heart of worldely vanitees and of flesshely
plesures hit withdraws the fruit of goostly living / than marvel thou not
sythen the wise gardener will cut away the superfluous branches which let
the tree of their fruit / if thy lord god which has taken the cure of thyn
heart cut fro the with the sharp knyfe of trybulacyon all those things
which you loves vaynely or shrewdly which let in yt ye gostly fruit of virtue
and make ye humors of love to continue in his propre bounds of thyn heart and
of such things as are profitable to thy salua cyon / for he will not that
thyn heart be to far dra wen fro him / ne yt it sprede by forayne and
unprofitable branches of vay^ne and worldly thing. An other manner of
purgacyon is like as the corn is purged fro the straw and the chafe by the
stroke of the fleyle And as the stroke of the fleyle purges the corn / ly ke
wise the stroke of trybulacyon purges ye heart And like as ye corn is made to
depart fro ye stra we / like wise the heart is made to depart fro the great
love of this world which should stele the her te fro god were not the fleyle
of trybulacyon. And this makes them to love god and greatly desire to be with
hy^ seeing these world so unstable and full of trybulacyon and pain. And for
this consideracyon says the prophet. Ecce ego in flagella paratus sum.
Behold I am ready to the fleyle. To this holy prophet purposed with a glad
heart to bear the stroke with the fleyle of god. Than thou that will have the
grain and corn of thyn heart purged / plain ye not of the stroke of
trybulacyo^ / for you can not be put in the garner of heaven there none shall be
put but such corn as is purged with the fleyle of our lord. And like as wha^
the corn is grene and not well dried than it brasteth under the fleyle and
cleueth faster to the chafe / also the hertes wiche are full of moisture of
flesshely pleasure and carnal affeccyons they braste by vnpacyence under the
fleyle and than the chare of sin cleueth faster to the^. An other wise
trybulaco^n purges the heart like as the pres sure purged the wine / for like
as the pressure which streyneth the resyns makes the wine depart fro the
foul gross matter of the dregs / like wise te^ptacyons / persecuco^ns / and
trybulaco^ns of this life purges thyn heart fro ye foul lusts and Inordynate
affeccyons of this life wherefore refuse not the pres sure if you will be laid
in to the seler. Thus the holy martyrs left their bodies in ye pressure and
tourmentes and the soul as precious wine was tonned in to the seler of
perdurable life.

THe fourth consolacyon in time of trybulaco^n is to remember the profit of
co^nynge to ye which a man or a woman is brought thereby / for of all connynges
the most necessary co^ nynge is a man to know himself and his lord god for
if he know himself well he shall know a wret che and a sinful soul which
has great need of ye help of our lord if ever he shall be ye child of sal
uacyon And if he know himself well he shall there by come to the knowledge of
our lord. For his mine de shall than be so much upon him that he shall souke
much knowledge out of him. To this know lege a man is brought by trybulacyo^ /
for thereby he shall be made to setlytell by the world and little by himself
and the less he sets by himself the more clearly he shall see his own
defautes and the more parfytly know the goodness of god and after yt the more
he shall love him. For as saint Austen says The cite of god / that is is to
say / an holy soul in whom our lord dwelieth by grace it begins at the
contempt and despysyng of himself / and ends at the love of god. And the
cite of the devil begins at the (...) and ends at the (...) Wherefore
saint Auste^ seeing the conning that comes by trybulaco^n he begins his
prayer in this wise. Nouerim me nouerim te. Lord teache me to know myself and
to know the. And like as the stroke of the rod makes the scoler to bow his
neck and look well on his book and to can well his lesson and to come again to
such knowledge as he has forgeten / like wise great trybulacyon makes a soul
to below to our lord which is the grette master and techer thereof. And
makes it to look well on the bo ke of contemplacyon / that is to say / to
remember his goodness and there own wretchedness / to remember the gifts
which it has received of him and the great unkindness that it has shows
to him / and the great pains which be ordained to hit for unkindness. And
the great Joye for the love that it has to god and kyndenesse. Also this rod
of trybulacyon makes it can his lesson well of virtuous ly uy^ge / as to pray
/ to fast / to watch / to give alms and to apply hit to all such things
whereby it trusts to get special help of our lord. And to good customs
and condycyons which hit has forgeten it makes hit to put them in exercise
again. And thus it makes them to letne well the lesson of there salvation. And
therefore says Solomon. Uirga et correctio tribuit sapie^cia^. The rod and
correcco^n brings the soul to wysedom. The young child when it is put
first to learning by the freyle and unstable dysposyco^n of the body that is
meued to have the eyes fro the book and want only to look about the walls and
rather to pycke strawes and to clatter to his felawes than to learn the lesson
to his great pro fyte / but when the master lyfteth the rod to stryke him /
than he looks up to him and said he will amend and is sorry yt he labored not
better his lesson. Like wise the frail soul looks down to erthely things
and vanytees of this life / as to rychesses / ho nours / beauty of body / good
appareyle in clothes and the speaking of such things most delyteth hit. But
when the great master almighty god lyfteth the rod of trybulacyon that it
sees great trouble is like to fall to hit than it lyfteth up the eyes to him
and cries mercy for myspendynge of time / and promyseth it will amend. And
with great betynge at the last hit is brought to the book and to learn well
the lesson. Thus prosperyte closes the eyes of the soul to god / and the
rod of aduersyte opens them and makes them to know him. Wherefore says
the prophet. Cognoscet^ dn^s iudicia faciens. Our lord shall be known in
making Jugement of punysshement and pain / and thus many a soul to whom he
sends pain and trybulacio^ in this mortal life / he preserves them fro ye
Jugeme^t o^ everlasting dampnacion Therefore says the apostle. Cum iudicamur a
deo corripimur ne cu^ hoc mu^do da^pnemur. when the Jugeme^t of god is showed
upon us by temporal pay^e for secret causes that we know not / but his
wisdom knows which sends pain to no man ne woman but for great cause.
When we are thus punysshed tha^ we are correct by cause we shall not be
dampened with this world / that is to say with worldely folk which set there
hertes on the felycyte and plesures of this world so gretely ye in manner they
little remember ne desire the pleasure yt is ordey^ed with god for the holy
souls which are ye despysers of this worldly felicyte. A woo woo many they be
which have little or none worldely trybulacyon / for much sorrow is ordained
to them in time coming and sorrow perpetual except ye great mercy of god / for
there is none yt lives so Innoce^tly in this life but they deserve gre te pay^e
both by co^myssyon of things which they ought to do and do them not. And also
by co^myssyon of things which they should not do and yet they do them.
Wherefore if they have no punysshement in this life / great punysshement is
ordained for them after this life / and lack of punysshement makes ye soul
that it forgeteth himself and god as it is said before and like as it is
rehearsed in ye book of Danyel that Nabugodonosor the king of Assyrye was so
far drawn by worldely prosperity fro the knowle ge of god / that our lord
to the knowledge of Nabu godonosor and to ye sight of man changed him in to the
symylytude of an ox / and. vii. year he was amon ge ye bestes. But after this
great punysshemen the looked up to henen with the sight of his soul askin ge
mercy of god. And after that he was restored to his own form and dygnyte
which he had before. By goostly vndsta^dynge those folk lift up their eyes
to heaven which have their medytacyons to god and order their love to him and
knowledge him their sovereign lord of whom desce^deth all their veyle and grace
to proceuere in virtuous living. For like as all flodes come of the sea like
wise all graces benefyces bodily and goostly come of god / and like as they
return again to the sea / so we ought to refer and order them all to him and
not pryncypally to our pleasure as the prophet says. Quod de manu tua
accepimus hoc reddimus tibi. That thing that we have taken of thyn hand that
we give to the. Thus such gifts as we receive of our lord if we spend them
in the works of virtue and give them to the poor in the name of him than we
give hy^ them again / as he says himself. Quicqd fecistis vni ex minimis meis
in noi^e meo. michi fe cistis. What so ever ye do to any of the least in my
name ye do that to me / wherefore such as refer re and give the goods that
they resceyue of our lord to hy^ again they continue the floodes of grace. For
as they give to him he is so lyberal that he ca^ not but give again such
things as he knows most expedyent to his lovers. And if the flood of his
bo^tyfulnesse come not to him again / than the flood of grace is stopped by our
defau^. For like as he is the beginning and ending of all goodness which
comes of him must be returned finally again. Thus by the deeds of thy life yt
confessys / and shows yt there is one god / and in these yt thankest him and
worshypest him. Many there are which do the contrary / as the apostle says ad
Titu^. There are many which say they know god but they deny hy^ in there
deeds of there living / for their life is abhoiable in the sight of god and
they live wretchedly as folk that had no faith / and rather as ye reprobate
and despised enemies of god than like unto his childer and friends. Mul ti
fatent^ se nosce dn^m factis aute^ nega^t cu^ sint abhoi^abiles and
i^credibiles ad oe^ opus reprobi. Thou which have given thy lord god again
such goods as you have received of him / at the hour of death thou shall be
lightly delivered of thy acou^te / for in this life you delyuerest ye of these
goods yt you have received of him and pute them in his hands again. And
therefore hit shall be said to the in that hour like as it is written in the
gospel of Matthew. My trusty ser uau^te thou haste ben faithful and true in
few things that I did give the / now I shall make the lord of many things
enter into the Joye of thy lord. Than thou that haste myspended the goods of
our lord to thy pleasure contrary to ye will of him and contrary to thy
profit / thou may be woo / for hard acounte shall be laid against the.
Wherefore if thou amend the not thou shall have strayt passage to thy
salvation. wherefore if our lord send the trybulacyon for myspe^dynge vaynly
the time of thy youth and of such goods as he has sent the in this he showed
that he would have the saved / and that thou should amend thy life and ones
begin to look upward to thy master for abuse the / he is which stryketh
the. Our lord when he sees that the rebelle hertes will not turn to him by
kyndenesse which he shows to them in his gifts than he beteth them to make
them come to him by trybulacyon and sharpness / and yet ofte^tymes they will
not come to him as he says in the book of ysaye. Populus non est reuersus ad
percuicente^ se. The people turn not to him that beteth hem. For in sickness
there mind renneth more for help by man in phesyke than it does to his help /
and when wrongs and Iniuryes be done to them they are redye to revenge them
and to do one shrew de turn for an other / and are not redye mercyfully to
forgive it for his sake / that they might obtain forgyuenes of him. And so
underneath ye rod of trybulaco^u they come not to correccyo^ / for they look
not as they are bound by the benefyce of their creacyon and redempco^n to keep
his commandments and holy counsel in reformacyon of their living here
yeshal understand that every true lover has his heart toward his love / and
they dread to be of get of there love and they heart to bef orgete there they
love. And thus our lord which has to us love un mesurable hated to be
forgete of us. And when we forgete him he beteth us and pulls away from us
such things as we most love in this world / as health of body / friends /
wordely goods. And often times he suffers the good name and co^mendacyo^ to
be pulled away fro such as has vain glory in the laud of name without
great deseruynge by holy merytes of good living of ye laud of god. And so he
makes hem to call on him and to know him by aduersyte which forgete him by
prosperyte. Like as ye butteler of Pharo had forgete Joseph wha^ he was comen
to prosperity which expowned to hy^ his dreme to his great solace and comfort
when he was in aduersyte. And because that worldely prossperyte brygeth a soul
to forgetefulnesse of god / our lord when he promised to ye people of Israel
great cytees with plente of rychesses / he warned he^ before that they should
not forgete him saying thus Non obliuiscaris dn^i dei tui. See that you in the
time of thy great prosperyte forgete not thy lord god. And to show to the
that he forgeteth not the / he says himself yt he has written the in his
hands No^ obliuiscartuin manibus en^me^s descrip si te. He bears yet and ever
shall the prynte of the wou^des in his hands which he suffered for the / and
also in his heart which was wounded for the. Learn you than to bear some sharp
token on ye to remember. him and the great pains that he has suffered for the
If he give the great richesse and great prosperyte in this temporal life /
think not for all this that he loves the so specially that you shall have
with him his richesse in heaven / for many which shall never come in heaven have
great plente of these goods.

And the mysusynge of hem is cause of their damp naco^n. wherefore richesse and
dygnyte of this world are called in scripture the gift of the lift hand /
as Solomon writes. In sinistra eius diuicie et gloria. Great multitude of
rich folk at ye day of Jugement shall stand at the lift hand of the Juge
/ and the poor at the right hand / if you shall have any love of our lord for
thy richesse it is for the good / use of hem / that is to say / by cause you
spe^dest hem to his honor and releef of him which have little to help
hemselfe for the love of him. And ever in the time of prosperyte take some
wylfull pain to remember him like as he has given example to the. For verily
like as bodily pleasure makes the soul to forgete himself and god / like wise
bodily pain makes it to remember himself and god. And this pains is
merytoryous when it is pacyentely suffered / but it is of a meruaylous great
merit when it is taken Joyfully and as a remedy to purge the soul fro sin
and bring it to special grace and love of our lord / which peradventure you
say / sir I marvel not if our lord with the rod of trybulaco^n beat the
froward and vngentyl hertes which know* him not. But I marvel gretely why
he beteth the gentle and mercyable hertes which know him and love to worship
him. To this I answer / this betyng is not only profitable to such as be
unkind and of sinful living / but also to such as be good and virtuous
which be not yet comen to the great perfeccy on of virtue to such time as
they be made perfyte by resystynge of great temptaco^n and gladly taking of
trybulacyon. For many souls which trust that they be strong to resyste
temptaco^n before they feel it / when it comes upon them fersely they feel
them self right feeble in comparyson as they trusted they had been. But by
contynuall betynge of temptacyon they come to great might of virtue and
knowledge of themself / and of what valor they be in virtue. Therefore says
Solomon. Qui non est temptatus quid scit He or she that has no great
temptacyon what can they / as who says right little. And thus our lord
suffers right merciful and gentyl hertes to him to suffer great temptaco^n /
for in that they learn to love god. For of all proves of love the grettest is
when a soul resysteth myghtely against great temptacyons for the love of god /
and because they would not offend his grace. And so they make a mighty
conquest of themself and do against their own Inclynaco^n to prefer the
will of god against their own will and desire. That holy man Job was brought to
great perfeccyon by aduersyte And Solomon that was so wise was brought to
great folysshenesse and unclean living by prosperyte. Here is example that
bodily aduersyte brings the soul to goostly prosperyte which stands in
goostly wysedom and virtue. And the bodily prosperyte begy^neth to goostly
folysshenesse and loss of virtue and finally to euerlasty^ge aduersyte pain
and trybulaco^n. And there is no soul so gracyously dysposed but it would
rather chose with temporal aduersyte to have the goostly richesse with the
love of god in this life / and after it be passed hens end less Joye and
fely^yte / than with temporal prosperyte goostly pouerte with hatred of god
and perpetual dampnaco^n. Sythen Solomon that was so wise lost wysedom in
prosperyte / you art not sure yt you shall keep thy wysedom in wordely plesures
and prosperyte / than arm the to trybulacyon if you wylt come to any
perfecco^n. And when you thynkest the trybulaco^n paynfull and heavy to bear /
comfort the again with remembrance that it is but short and shall bring the
Joyfully out of the world / sor thy last day shall be the end of thy trouble
for ever / and think that our lord calls the to him thereby where thou shall
see him in his mageste and be replenysshed with the solacions sight of his
pardurable glory. And think verily that he which puttyth the to this great
proof ordeyneth great things for the. For like as the knight gets not of
his king to such time yt he be proved in acts of cheualerye and have myghtely
foghten for his king / so look thou for no great tewarde of god except thou
have great temptacyon for his sake / other against the devil by goostly temp
tacyon or against thy flesh with temptaco^n of glotonye sloth or lecherye /
or against ye world with co uetyse. But of all those batayles the goostly
batayl in faith and consyens is most troublous and heavy to bear / and of all
other it is most profitable to that sou le which will fight in this battle is
most dyrect against the devil / and the conquest of him is most pryncypall as
saint Poule says. Nemo coronabi^ nisi qui legittime certauerit. There shall
none be crowned but such as lawfully fygureth and pre uayleth by keeping of
there soul fro consent to syn ne. And the more dygnyte that a knight or a
clerk is call dto the more proof to be made before of his habylyte. Thus by
these techynges thou may understand that trybulacyon is ordained of god in
this life to call the and led the again in to knowledge of thyself and in to
remembrance of thyn own heart. And know you verily that the heart which has
not cast out of himself the Joye of worldely prosperyte / may not parfytly
feel ne know himself For the pleasure of this false Joye so inchothes the
heart that it may not return in to himself / but it is al occupied with
worldely matters which in that it may not / it ordeyneth to the increace of
this vain Joye / and so it labors ever more and more to blind himself as
long as it renneth outward in worldely prosperyte / and thereof complayneth
him the prophet David in the person of asynner where as he says. Lumen
oculorum meorum ipsum non est niccum. Thelyght of my^ eyes is not with me /
alas they may be sorry to whom our lord has given great natural will and
knowledge and they spend the candell of there wysedom in ordering of worldely
vanytees / in ordering of themself they spend but little or none / and it is
given to them specially for themself / that is to say / to the well of there
soul and not to the pleasure of their body. Like as every man is most nyghe
himself so under god he ought most to love himself / and in order to those
things which shall be most to the avail of himself as to god and virtue /
and nothing is so nessarye to be known of man as himself. For all knowledge
without knowledge of himself is but vain to bring a man to the end that he
was made fore / and like as he that has not himself has nothing / for if a
man have no parfyte power to rule himself no thing is well ruled that comes
in his hands. For there is no outward deed well ruled except it come of a well
ruled soul / for the goodness of the outward deed presupposes the goodness
of the good deed of the will Inward / and so if you have not a good will there
is no thing good that you do. But peradventure you wylt say than you do
never no good deed. For commonly when you haste will to doony good deed there
comes in thy mind some shrewde entente / as vay ne glory and laud of the
world or to have a temporal profit thereby / or to plese thy friend or for
fere to dysplese him / or of enemyte you do to the rebuke of other which do
not see like as you do. Or you leuest things undone by cause you would not
yt other should follow the. Thus commonly thy will is not good / and than after
this doctrine thy will is not good. Here I answer yt it is impossible to the
to let such though^ to come to thy mind. But as long as you would do any good
things for ye love of god and profit of thy soul if yt vain or evil
thought we re away than you do it pryncypaly for god / and yt evil or vain
thought lets no thing the merit of thy deed. As thus perauenture you see
a poor man and would give a penny in alms to him / and forth with comes in
thy mind yt you shall have a laud of the world therefore or such as see ye /
this thought shall not make the to lose thy merit as long as you would give yt
penny to the poor man for the love of god if no man should see the than you do
it pryncypally for god / this will is merytoryous and ye deed following
thereupon. Than retornyng to my saying before like as he which has not
himself has no thing. Like wise he yt knows not himself knows no thing
/ that is to say / profitable to himself / as to purchesse the reward of our
lord in the everlasting Joye after this mortal life. The wretched man or
woman that fixes there love most on this worldely prosperyte he forgeteth
himself for he is not with himself. Look what thing ye soul most loves
there it is most by conuersacyon of the mind / and the werkers of the soul
most run thither As our savior says. Ubi thesaurus tuus ibi cortuu^. Look
where that thing is that you love there is thyn heart. Thus the heart of the
covetous man is with his gold and silver. The heart of the leche rous man is
with the person there he has most fless hely pleasure to. The heart of the
proud man is there he has most reverence and with his fresshe clothes Thus
the worldely prosperyte and false transytorye Joye in hertely creatures draws
the heart of men and woyme^ fro themself / and with much sorrow oftentimes
they come to such things as they love / and therefore they by them with less
labor and sorrow they might bye great excellent Joye in heaven / than they bye
this falte worldely Joye the which hastily they shall lose and than they shall
have everlasting sorrow. But like as a man that is besyeged when he would
eschew and goo out of his house he is compelled to return and is betyn in
again by such as have besyeged him and is brought thereto that he dare not ones
set out his foot at the door. Like wise our lord of his great mercy sen death
the soudyoures of trybulacyon to such souls and hertes as he loves and would
that they should abide at home and beteth them in to themself / and the more
trybulacyons there are and also the more they be so much ye hertes have less
power to stroye abroad from themself. Than thank god theros which sends
the aduersyte whereby thou art made to leave the love yt you haste to worldely
prosperyte and learn to know and to love god and thyselfe in order to god and
thus to abide at home and keep well ordered the love of thy soul. For when there
is no dweller in an house soon it falls to ruin and dekaye. Like wise the
souls which are not Inhabyte in this manner fall to waste and come to naught.
Blyssed is that man or woman which abides in himself and lerneth to know
himself how they shall keep there body obedyent to their soul / and their
soul obedyent to god. And above all thing attends to keep himself that the
flesh draw not the soul to the love of the world / but that the soul
draw the flesh to the service of god / and has the great Joye in the
clerenesse of conscience / is when it lives without rumors in his conscience
of dedely sin as it is commonly said. A clean heart a Joyful heart. And
sorrowful may that heart be that is lykened to a common mynstrell or a Jogular
which is more in other men's houses than in his own. And when he syngeth and
makes most myrthe in other men's houses than soon after he is most sorrow
in his own house. Like wise the heart which most seeks solace in worldely
things outward / hit has less Joye of goostly things Inward. A than I
say to the which felest thyn heart fro the in delectaco^ns of the flesh or
plesures of the world / and than thou haste such pleasure to abide there that
thou have nowyl to come home and to forsake him utterly which thou see are
not to the profit of thy soul / than call to our lord that he will send
his soudyoures of trybulaco^n and drive the home again and to constrayne thyn
heart to know thy self and to attend wisely in keeping of thyselfe that you
do no thing contrary to the will of god and to thyn everlasting avail / as
ye poor mynstrell is constrained to torn again to his house when the festes
are done / for than he has none other place for to torn to. So after all
wordely pleasure when it is paste and trybulacyon make ye not to torn before you
shall torn home to the house of thyn heart and you shall find there a sorrowful
house. For every vain Joye yt you haste had in this lif you shall find there a
great sorrow / yeta^d you take to the trybulaco^n of penance before you depart
fro this world it shall keep the house of thyn heart fro the most sharp
brennynge fire of hell / for as the prophet says. Contritu^ et humiliatu^
deus non despicies. Good lord you despysest not an heart which is meked and
brought to know hem self by trybulaco^n. Than you which love everlasting
consolacyon and felest thyn heart is run to vain delectacio^ pray
trybulacyon to come and return the home again Like as the douue constrained
turned to the ship of Noe because she could find no ground to set her fete
upon. Noe is as much to say in our langage as rest / the ship is ye heart /
ye douue is ye love pray god yt ye flood of trybulaco^n so cover all vain
things fro thy love that it be constrained to return to Inwardly rest of thyn
heart by tranquyllyte and p^sse of a clean consyence and holy occupyenge of
thyn heart with holy medytaco^ns of god and of virtue with perfyte desire of good
works and blyssed customs to ye pleasure of god and thy great promoco^n. Thou
that sekest rest in worldely things you art deceived / for you shall find no
rest but in god for none other thing may sacyate and content the soul but
god / he shall fulfylle the desire of thy soul as the prophet says Saciabor
cu^ apparuerit glia tua. I shall sacyate and replenysshe with Joye when I shall
see the good lord in thy glory. Therefore it is written in Ecclesiastice. In
oi^bus requie^ q^siui et i^ hereditate dn^i morabor. I have sought rest in all
things and now I shall dwell in the heritage of god / yt is to say / mine
heart shall dwell in desire of ye kingdom of heaven where is ye perfyte rest /
therefore says dauyd to our lord Co^uertere ai^a mea in requie^ tua^. Torn
mine heart in to thy rest. The soul of man may find no such rest in the
things of this world as in themself when it is ordered in ye living
according to ye laws of god and such a soul does rest for it is content in
all things with ye werkynge of our lord and yt soul is the dwelling place of
our lord of whom it is written. In pace factus e^ locus eius. His place is made
where is peace / and peace of conscience is his peace for yt comes of him.
Therefore says the prophet. Conuertere ai^a mea in requie^ tua^. Torn my
soul in to thy rest / and Solomon says Intrans in domu^ mea^ conquiesca^ cu^
ea. I entering in to the house of my conscience there I shall rest. Than you may
be woe which sekest rest in outward things and lokest little for the rest of
thy house at home in thy conscience. If you would take labor to return home
and well search the house of thy consyence / thou which art a great lover of
the world you shall find there a troubelous house / wherefore to such as be
the renners out our lord says by the prophet Mychee. Hiis qi forissu^t
dicet^ ve ve. To these that more are occupied with other things than with
himself hit shall be said woe woe be to you / that is to say / those which
have there heart so set of outward things yt they forgete themself / and
specially yt heart has cause to be woe which is departed fro themself and
sytteth so fast in worldely vanytees and in manner it is so fast holden with
these vanytees as with an oost of enemies yt it can not torn again home to
themself. Every worldely pleasure yt apereth outward it is a snare to rye it
fast and keep it fro themself / wherefore every soul remember well himself and
see whereit set yt love if ye love be fixed on any thing which god would not
it should love than it is taken in a snare of da^pnacyon axcept it have help
of delyueraunce by the grace of our lord wherefore it must daily cry for
help to hy^ to such time he have loved it The love also of every creature
which is more than it ought to be is a snare thereto / wherefore it must
beseech god yt it may love no things but such as are good / and also that it
may love good things in order to god and profit of the soul. To an heart
that has not set the love on the vanytees of the world it is little dyf
fyculte to keep hem out of the heart / but wha^ they have ones taken there
lodging in the heart by that love that the heart has to them without great
labor and dylygence they will not be driven out again And oftentyme when our
lord says that it is not expedyent to such as he loves that these vanytees
abide in the heart and also he sees yt the person that he loves helps not
himself to drive him out / or peradventure would not have hem out. Than he as
a true lover sends out his oost of trybulacyons to repelle and to drive out
of the heart these vanitees whchey and they might abide would finally destroy
the house of the heart and rob it of all the goods of virtue which is in
it. Wherefore Ecclesyastes says. Precurre prior in domu^ tua^. That is to say.
When thou see the worldely vanytees run in to thyn heart / run thou
before and stops them and shyt ye door of thyn heart that they have no
lodging there by remembrance of the hurtes that they do there. For they keep
the heart fro ye love of god fro the love of themself in order to god fro the
love of virtue / from holy medytaco^ns / from holy desires fro devout prayers
/ from deeds of pe naunce. And commonly when the vanytees occupye it is dysposed
to no virtue or to little. Such men and wymen as most labor to get and to
keep the plesures and goods of this world / and labor little to keep there
heart but let it run where it will these are great foles / for finally these
shall lose. All these tran sytorye vanytees they labor most to get and keep.
and also themself from the eternyte of Joye / and be brought to perpetual
pain in defaute yt they keped norther heart as they should have done the time
of this life. And those which gives little keep to the wordely vanytees and
prosperyte / but most they apply their mind how they may their hertes keep
well accupyed. These after the passing of all worldely pleasures shall have
their hertes replenysshed with the most delycate and plesau^tes hertely
delytes of the glory of god and of the Inestymable bliss and Joy of the
felycyte of angels and saints in heaven. These which ordeyne them most
specially to keep there hertes and little set by those things which worldely
folk most desire are called foles in this world / but they are called wise
of god / and their wysedom shall be commended of all the heavenly multitude in
the kingdom of god. For this cause says Solomon in his prouerbis. Omni
custodia serua cor tuu^ quia ex ip^o vita procedit. With all thy dyly gence
keep well thyn heart for thereof comes life / and dampnable death comes if it
be not well keped.

This heart is the longing of thy lord god which has great pleasure to abide
in it when it is clenly keped fro fylthy mocyons of sin as he says in the
book of Proverbs. Delicite me esse cu^ filiis hoim. My delight is to be with
the childern of men For their love he becam a child himself borne of the
virgyne Marye wherefore like as you desyrest to be welcome to his house see that
you keep well thine house of thyn heart / and oftentimes turn thereto and
dress it yt he with no thing there be offended / but yt he may have a pleasure
for to behold it as he says in Cantices. Reuertere vt intueamur te. Torn
again yt we may behold the. He says not yt I may be hold the but yt we may
behold the / that is to say / if you see well to thy self than I shall have a
great pleasure to see the / for than I shall garnysshe thy sou le with my grace
to thy most profit and my pleasure Than I exhort the which retorneth not to
thy self as you should / take pacyently the trybulacyon which our lord
sends the to the entente that you shall give good attendau^ce to the keeping
of thyn heart and forsake the love of those wretched or vain plesures which
let thyn heart fro the love of him. Thou thynkest yt thy trouble and pain
gretely hurts the* but it is the gretest profit and help that you may have
in this life and the gretest token yt our lord loves the and of this you
should be most glad for his love you shall find finally to thy most Joye and
comfort after this transytorye pain and trouble. This trybulacyon brings
the both to god and to thy self / like as thy vain plesures in prosperyte
had driven the fro both. And for this cause pain and trybulacy on is called
the band of god / for it tyeth the to god like as prosperyte louseth the
from-hym and byndeth to such wretched and peryllous liberte of ye world / and
in these bands thou shall learn to know god and thy self and to change thy
life in to an other manner of living. And when thou by holy customs of this
life art tied to him / than he will tie the by pain to keep the at home with
himself And thus he sends trybulacyon not only to bring the heart home to
themself but also to keep it at home that it go not fro themself. Thy lord
god deleth gracyousely with the when he called the fro plente to pouerte. I
mean not that he make the to lose all thy good / but when he makes the to
set little by thy good so that thyn heart is poor and naked without them /
that is to say / without great affection and love of home. So says Solomon.
Est pauper in diuicus. There are some which are poor in rychesses / that is to
say / which that set their heart in manner no more on them than if they
had no rychesses. To this goostly pouerte the which in the sight of almighty
god is most habondaunt richesse are the souls brought to him when that they
are sore hunted by great aduersyte and trouble and tied to our lord with the
band of trybulacyons. And not withstanding that our lord keeps the thus
tied that thou may not run at thy will at large as you haste ben acustomed
before time / think not that thou loses thereby any lyberte / but rather our
lord puts the in more lyber te. There is no very perfyte lyberte of the
soul but only in things of virtue. This lyberte to run with thyn heart and
love to vanytees or to sinful works of this life / this lyberte is thraldom
and not rmenda ble more than it is to suffer a seek man as he that is in an
hot axes to ete and drink what he will desire / for his appetyte is so
dysordred with corrupt humors that commonly he desires those things whi che be
most contrary to his health / like wise that soul is in a peryllous lyberte
which at his own pleasure has power to sin. But when our lord by
trybulacyon called it to him and to be the lover of virtue at lyberte this is
the perfyte lyberte. And ye other lyberte to sin is rather seruage for it
makes the soul servant to the devil and finally brings to the bou^dshyp
of him in hell. And the lyber te of virtue brings to the most perfyte
freedom of heaven. When the phesycyan suffers the pacyent to take what mete and
drynk yt his appetyte is most to it is a sign that he dyspeyreth of his health
/ and co monly they will say he is but a deed man wherefore let him take what he
will / like wise when our lord the great phesycyan lets the live after thy
fles shely pleasure and makes no restraynth by trybulacio^ it is a token that
he sets little by the. And that thou haste goostly sickness which is not
lykely to have remedy / for such are more desirous to fulfill there own will
than the will of god. They despise god as he says by the prophet ysaye.
Filios enutriui et exaltaui ipsi aute^ spreueru^t me. I have nourysshed my
childern with goods of this world and I have exalted them to honor and they
have despy sed me. if you will ask me what is very. fredom I say that he is
not most free which may do most what he will / but he is most free which
lest may do evil / and so there is most lyberte where lest power is to sin.
Tha^ according to this doctrine before rehearsed / sythen our lord makes the
by trybulacio^ to know thy self and him and tyeth ye to him that thou shall
not go fro him / and brings the fro thraldom of the fend and wretched
living to perfyte lyberte of his love and execuco^n of virtuous deeds.
wherefore if you feel thy self dyscomforted by trouble and pain reduce these
great profytes to thy mind and they shall comfort the again. For thy comfort
is to remember that he loves the. And the most token of his love is yt he
ledeth the by trybulacyon to himself. where fore Joye thou in him and he shall
Joye in the / and than all things to thy most avail shall prospere with the.

THe fyfthe consolaco^n in time of trybulacyon is to remember how you art made
thereby hastily to spend the in the way to heaven / and to the blyssed presence
of thy lord god. For as it is said before. Every pain comes of god /
wherefore every pain is ryghtwysse. And every sy^ne comes of us and every
sin is vnryghtwysse. wherefore as many trybulaco^ns and payns as you have as
many mes se^gers you have sent fro heaven to speed ye theder like as a man which
in ye flouryng time of somer going thorugh a field full of fair flowers and a
sweet medo we of time will gyder of ye flowers and for the swetnes and solacyous
abiding in ye place he will sit or lay him down / and sometime fall on sleep
/ and so ye night comes upon hy^ before he have ends his Journey / And ye man
which labors in the foul way the winter tide he fyndeth no place to rest
in to he co me to the end of his Journey and yet makes hy^ to haste fast yt
he may come to an end of his labor. Like wise the folk which are in the
pleasant prossperyte of this life / they are so occupied with gade ring things
of pleasure as rychesses / flesshely delec tacios / honors and dygnytees yt
they forgete there Jor neye whether they are bound out of this world. For here
they seek rest in the pleasure of this life in manner as there were none other
felycyte ordained for man / and here they lie slepynge in sin and
wretchedness to ye night of death come upon hy^ / and than they are taken with
the deuyles of hell / and never come to see god in his glory which should
have been ye end of her pylgremage. But such as be in the winter way of
aduersyte full of great blast of temptaco^ns in ye soul / full of sharp thorns
of pains and bodily sekenes / full of great flodes of worldly trybulacyon
these folk haste him / for in there way they fy^de but bytternesse / and
therefore they haste hy^ that they may come to rest hy^ swetly at ye end of
there Journey af ter there sore labor. For ye bytternesse of trybulaco^n takes
fro the heart al false pleasure of this world / and so it makes the good
souls which our lord utterly and specially loves to speed them to him / and
will not suffer hem to rest hem and abide in the way / the things which he
calls the to by trybulaco^n pacy ently taken are sogrete / so precious / so
perdurable / and euerlastyngly abiding that he will not yt you shall make
taryenge in the little things which shortly shall slyp and vanysshe away. A
good meruayll it is that such persons to whom god has given great knowledge
make their abiding in the little things / and by the taryeng they make in ye
small things and great labors they have about hem to order hem fylty to their
pleasure they show well they have forgeten ye great things yt our lord called
hem to. All things which delight the heart Inmoderatly make ye heart to tarry
and loses much time of his pylgremage / but when pain and trybulaco^n take
away vain delight fro the heart and makes ye thing bytt which was wont to be
beloved than it makes the heart to styre him forward swetly and leueth the
vain taryeng. And therefore the prophet says. Multiplicate su^t infirmitates
eorum postea accelerauerunt. When sickness is multeplyed than such as have
tarried before they haste hem for war de full fast. Ha good lord many one
should go full slowely in their Journeye of they were not hasted forward with
sharp calling by trybulaco^us and in manner compelled with vyolence to proceed
in their way. And like as the crooked fete and affeccyons are feeble and
oftentyme would rest in the vain pleasure excent they were excyted to go / so
our lord such as he specially loves he calls oftentyme upon hem. And
therefore it is written in the book of Exodi. That the Egypcyens constrained the
childern of Israel to go out of Egypt in token that trybulacyons which are
understand by the Egypcyens constrayne the hertes of the chosen childer of our
lord to go out of this world by the affeccyons of there love and speed them to
that live there the great pleasure stands in love / and there no thing is but
that is detely loved. And when the love goth fro the world the heart goth fro
the world. For like as the body goth with the foot so the soul goth with the
love / and where the love is there the heart is O how glad the hertes should be
to depart from those things where they have more pain than pleasure / more
sorrow than solace / and go to those things where they shall ever have myrthe
and swetnesse and never feel point of bytternesse where is full Joye full peace
with out dystemperau^ce of pain or trybulaco^n. And he re yt haste no great
pleasure in any wordely things according to thy dyfordynate appetyte / but
fynaly it shall torn the to torment of heart. Than comfort thy self in
trybulacyons for they drive ye out or the prison of pain to the ryall kingdom
of pleasure / fro the fetters and chains to ye crown / as Eccl. says Interdu^
deducit ^s de carcere ad regnu^. Some time a prisoner is drawn out of prison
to come to a kingdom. The heart is in prison when it is tied by love to ye low
erthely things of this world / and ye more ye love is on hy^ the more deep is
ye heart in prison. Out of this deep prison our lord draw the with the bands
of trybulaco^n when he makes thy love to depart fro those things which you
love so much / like as ye angel stroke saint Peter on ye side and bad hy^
rise swystly and go out of prison / as it is written in the book of Act. So our
loorde stryketh the many a time by his angel on the lift side by aduersyte to
make ye hastily to depart fro this prison / when he fulfylleth thyn heart so
with sorrow / or the body with pain yt the pleasure is gone yt thou have in
things of this world / or when he whithdra weth hem fro the with loss or
death / or when he sufereth hem to be unkind to the or trouble the and thwart
with the which you loved so much / than he caseth ye out of prison. Like as
saint Peter playned not of the stroke whereby he was brought out of pry son / so
see yt ye plain the not of ye stroke which bry^geth the out of the goostly
prison of thy soul and ma keth the to depart fro love not profitable to the.
For this is a suffrau^t stroke which delyuereth the of ye feerfull prison of
which follows the prison of hell to such yt never will depart fro this
pryso^ of sin in this life / or else pnrgatorye to such as lately depart
therfro. And if thou will not suffer this stroke of thy side pacye^tly for thy
self / yet suf fre it for his sake which was stryken in to the side with a
spear for thy sake / and receive not grutchyngly thy lords messengers which
are sent to bring the to him and bring the fro peryllous place but welcome
him hertely and thank thy lord god upon thy knees whith hands and heart
which sends hem to the / and than thou shall do great pleasure to him gre te
profit to thy self / and the sooner they shall depart fro the when they have
brought the to him by very true love / when thou murmures against thy
trybulacyon than thou do that is in the to repelle the messyngers of god fro
the. This is fygured and betokened in the messengers which were send to hem
that were beyond the flome Jordan and they resysted against the princes message
and send the mes sengers again without worship and with empty hand. Flome
Jordan is as much to say as lowenesse or meekness the which techeth the
hertes to love god. And tho that dwell beyond the flood which pass
meekness and are proud of the benefyt and creatures of god. And the proud
folk that vnreue cently receive trybulacyons the messengers of the king / and
so the trybulacyons go void without re ward by these ungentle receyuers /
and that that the messengers are dysworshypped / that lord and king is
dysworshypped which did send them. Thou sholdest as well or better receive
trybulacyons for the love of him that sent them to you as for the love of that
thing that they are send fore. Trybulacyons they are sharp but they are
profy table / for they tourment the heart in purgynge and they purge it
tourmentyng in tourmenting when the rebelle hertes receive trybulacyons
unworthily than thty have the tourment but they wanten the purgaco^n of ye
soul / for by the vnpacyence they fou le themself more than they were before.
And they may well sore lamente the which have the pain and do lose the
fruit thereof. Than I exorte the and pray the in the part of our lord god
that the which that knowed himself a sinner and would love god and come to
his kingdom that thou receive thankefully trybulacyons of his sendynge. And
when that thou felest the pain think than that thou herest the voice of our
lord god calling the to himself from the peryllous place that thou ar^ in /
and should stand in great feere and in great Juberte for to come to him
except he thus called the to come.

The sixth consolaco^n follows here to such as have pain and trybulacyon
which comes of remembrance how these pains are det^ which of deute must
be paid to almygh ty god fro whom no sinner shall ascape without
punysshemente. Ne no man may take from him that thing that which is his
deute ne dysceyue hy^. This det^ are the pains with which god of his
ryghtwysnesse does ponysshe sins which are not unknown to hy^ whether they
be done by body or soul / there is no sin may be hyde from his Infenyte
knowledge / as Ecclesiastes says. Oia videt ocl'os illius. His eye sees all
things. Oculi dn^i ml'to plus lucidiores su^t super sole^ circu^spicientes
oe^s vias hoim and profundu^ abissi. No thing is so clear in our sight with
the light of the son as all things are in his sight which sees clearly all the secre te euten^ of her^. Thus he knows all offenses and of ryghtwysnesse
he must punysshe hem / and his power is suffycyent punysshe every sin after
the deseruynge / wherefore after the ryghtwysnes of god every sinner is detter
to render pain to our lord And notwithstanding yt the eternal pains of hell
are translate in to temporal pains by ye sacrament of confession which was
deutes for dedely sins yet there is great pain beside there penance ordey ned
to sinners other in this life or in purgatory. For many sins are done in
this life which are never showed in confession for they are forgete / and the
goostly fader gives penance but only for such as he has showed to hy^ by
confession. Nevertheless he assoyleth from all as well from those sins yt you
art not confessyd of as for those yt you do confess with standing you would be
confessyd of them if they came to thy mind so yt you shall not be dampened for
them / but you must suffer temporal pain for them here or in purgatory. Than
think that thou art detter of great pain to god for many a dedely syn ne that
you haste forget sythen you was borne which you had not in mind the time of
confession. And in ye that everlasting pain is ordained for dedely syn ne you
may understand yt when ye outragyous pain of hell is committed in to
temporal pain that this pain must be great which must be paid for dedely
sin. Also much penance which is enjoined is not fulfilled perfytly in this
life and therefore there leueth much to punysshe. Also daily we multe plye
venyall sins which deserve great temporal pain / and by trybulaco^n
pacyently taken you art made quyte of these deutes and as much as ye suffres
shall be rebated when ye come to thy count. And like as in the count a
counter of led or laton lies for an hondreth ponnde and yet in himself is
not so much worth. So one day pain well taken shall stand for the pain of
a year in the which is contained CCC days / as our lord says by the prophet
Ezechyell. Diem pro a^no ded^ tibi. I have given the a day for a year. O how
glad should you be than of one days pain which delyuereth the fro the mo re
bitter pain of a year. O how gentle should you take this pain which makes
to the such a quytaunce / sythen thy lord whom thou art detter to of his
great mercy and gentylnesse with this little delyuereth the fro the more
therefore I counsel the what payue that so ever thou suffer set it in thy
compet and beseech god that it may stand for thysy nne to acquyte the fro the
great pains that thou haste de served by sin. Thus the thief which did
ha^ge on the right hand of our lord he turned his her te to him / and by
that pain well taken he was delivered from all pains and had the clear
sight and fruycyon for ever of the most glorious trynyte. Woe may that man or
woman be yt which daily multeplyeth debt bysynne and little or naught he
paid by pain. For another he suffers the pain mekely to his profit as a
verry penytent the which god sends unto him / ne takes to him wylful ly any
paynefull thing for to deliver him out of his debt / and so he shall come
before the Juge at ye hour of death charged with the hole count in manner of his
life which shall be strayte to him / for and he labor not for mercy when the
soul is in the body he shall never have mercy after that it be departed ne be
rebated of his deutees. In hell shall no deute be rebated neither by long ne
by bitter sufferynge. There shall lords and ladies weep for their apareyll and
the vain beauty of her bodies the which they had ordained to pride / to
lechery and to vain honors of the world. There shall also every crafts man
weep for the mysusynge of his craft. And also clerks the which have not well
used their conning to the avail of the souls. And merchants for their
false penny worthes And sinful men and wymen which provide not here for their
souls which are called merchants of the earth / for their labor is for to
get erthely solace / and there they shall see that they have but small
penyworthes for the labor of their life / for all the great solace and hertely
Joye shall be gone from them for ever. But the heavenly merchants the which
ordeyne their labors of this life to bye the heavenly Joys and than they shall
see the great penyworthes passing all the estymacyons of all the erthely
creatures the which they shall receive of the hands of almighty god in those
great Joys of endelesse bliss / as it is written in the book of Sapyence.
Just^ autem imperpetuum viuent et apud dominum est merces little. The ryghtwysse
men shall live euerlastyngly and with our lord is reserved the reward of
their great labors Than thou the which know thy self a sinner without
great pain thou may not comethyder for none shall enter in to the kingdom
of heaven a fore that they have paid all their dettes of pain for there is no
place to pay deute of pain. For the great and the perfyte felycyte of that
kingdom may suffer there no mysery to be neither of sin ne pain. Wherefore
all you the which are faithful souls and believe the promysse of god to have
Joye after this life if that ye will be ruled after his will. I exhort you and
pray you to receive with a good heart these present trybulacyons and pains
that ye feel in this life the which trybulacyo^s deliver you of great pains
without co^paryson which ye should suffer and long time be retrayed fro your
Joye after this life. And now if ye take these little pains Joyfully ye shall
go lightly away and hastly to yt Joyful Inherytau^ce and most blyssed
felouship there it shall not be possible to suffer any pain / thy pain shall
be lesser in comparyson to these Joys than the leden cou^ters are which lie
in the count in comparyson to the great so^mes yt they lie fore / as
Ecclesyastes says. Est qi multa redimit modico precio. Some are which acquyte
hem of great debt by little payment. And if you be of such perfecco^n yt by
the merytes of thyn holy living and blyssed labors taken for god yt you haste
deserved remyssyon of thy fynne and art acquyted of thy pain / yet if
trybulaco^n come receive it gentylly / for it is not send to the without great
cause other to the Incresse of thy merytes or to save the fro sin which thou
should fall in except by trybulacyon and pain yt our lord preserved the from
hit. For many which are Innocents and full perfyte should lose their
Innocency a^dvertue except they were keped by trybulaco^n. Tha^ all ye which
would go quyte out of this world from all deute of pains make your payment
whiles yt this money of trybulaco^n temporal is of so great a valor that a
little of it more may redeem you fro that Infe^yte pain and trybulacyon
which shall never have end after this life and purchesse to you eternyte of
Joye.

THe seventh consolaco^n is to remember that trybulacyon strengthed the heart
and makes it able to receive the precious gifts ot grace. For like as the
hamer of the goldsmythe and the betinge thereof makes the metal to streche on
long under his hand according to his will / of the which he makes his
vesseyll. So almighty god he makes by trybulaco^n the heart to streche on
broad and to be a vesseyll to receive and retene the bekefyces of his graces
there before it was a hole mass as a lump of metal without abylyte any thing
to receive of our lord / wherefore in tribulacyon thank thy lord god which
makes of thyn heart a chalys to receive great habondau^ce of his grace. Of this
dryuyng on broad of ye heart with strokes of tribulaco^n speaks the prophet
there he says. In tribulecione dilatasti micht. Lord you haste dylated and
enlarged mine heart by trybulacyon. wherefore I counseyll the which desires to
be ye elect vesseyll of grace a while pacyently to suffer the stroke of ye
hamer of trybulaco^n in the forge and smythe of this world. This lord never
will stryke the above yt you may be re if you order the to suffer / as he says
in the gospel. Dedit vnicuique scdm propria^ virtute^. He has given to every
man after his power. And the more he beteth the the more large he entendeth to
make the vesseyll of thyn heart / and with the more quantyte of his grace to
replenysshe it with all. And like wise as the more precious metal is more
obedyent vnd the hands of the work than that metal which is of lesser
valor / as gold is more apt in ye golds mythes hand than iron and more
precious work he may work therein for it is more obedyent vnd the hamer Like
wise the pacyenthertes are ye precious golden heart which are obedye^t to ye
strokes of trybulaco^n after ye will of our lord / and in these he werketh
precious works of grace and many fair virtues / and the se curyous and most
precious works of ye great wise dome of god shall euerlastyngly apere in these
obedyent and pacyent heart to the honor of god and great pleasure to all his
lovers in the kingdom of heaven where clearly shall be showed all the secret
werkynges of the heart which are had in this life. Suffer thy lord than esely
to beat away yt rosty mocyons and sinful desires of thyn heart and to make it
a clean vessel apt to receive ye Infusyo^ of his grace. And if ye stroke of yt
hamer be paynful and hard to abide recomforte the again in yt the goldsmyth is
so wise and so good yt he may stryke no stroke but to ye most avail of the
vessele of thyn heart and according to his will which no thing may do but
well. And if yt be gentyle in sufferynge his strokes and left thy^ heart to hy^
desiring yt he do therewith like as it pleseth himself you shall find hy^
gentyl in temperynge of his strokes and yt he will more esely work after as the
form of work requires. But commonly the goldsmyth stryketh most strokes on
yt vessel which is most precious work. The hertes which are without
dyscyplyne and techynge they are hard and dysobedyent vnd ye hamer and rather
they break than they will bow after the ente^te of ye werker. Be not as an
old broken pan which when the werker stryketh it breketh and makes many mo
holes than were before. Thus hard heart and dry without love ordeuocyon to god
incresse her pain vnd the stroke of trybulaco^n for they have no regard but
only to their pleasure and none to their demeryte and the right wysnesse of god
which may not leave sin unpunished in this world he stryketh because he
would spare ye after this life where ye strokes shall be most bitter to such as
tha^ shall suffer hem. And like as the heart grows in faith byleuyng yt the
pain and trouble comes of our lord. Also in pacyence by wylfull taking and
thanking god thereof / also in meke nesse thinking yt he is worthy to have
such pain and much more / so the heart grows in the grace and love of our
lord and ye reward of glory. Thus meueth ye Ecclesyastes saying. Sustine
sustentaco^es dei and riu^gere deo and sustine vt crescat in nouissi^a vita
tua. Suffer the suffrynges of our lord and be you Joined to him. Suffer you thy
life may wax in the end. This saying may be understand diverse wise as thus
/ suffer thou that god suffer for the / or suffer thou that god suffers with
the / or suffer thou that god suffers in the / and the first sense is that
thou shall suffer that god suffers for the in this world. He suffered for
thegrete trouble and enemyte of ye world / he suffered for the great sclau^der
and evil report / he suffered for the contempt and despysynge / he suffered for
the great pouerte wylfully / he suffered for the great pain in body as
werynesse / watch / hongre / thyrst / great sorrow in soul / great pain in
body / and finally the most great outrage pain of death / and more than may
be suffered by natural power For he retained his soul in his body in
sufferaunce of pain above the power of nature largely to recompense for our
offense / so that he yield up his soul with a great cry as scryptute says
Uoce magna tradidit spiritu^. But by the course of nature the body is so
febled before the departyuge of the soul yt it has no power to sormeony
voice. And so should the body of our savior have be had not he retained his
soul to suffer plentefully pain for our saluaco^n / as he says in the
gospel of Johan. Potestate^ habeo ponendi ai^am mea^ and potestate^ habeo
iteru^ resumendieam. I have power to put my soul fro my bobye when I will /
and I have power to receive it again and Join it to the body. And as the
prophet says. Apud dn^m mi^a and copiosa apud eu^ redempcio. With our lord
is mercy and plenteuous redempco^n. Remember yt thy lord god for thyn offe^se
suffered these great pains of his great mercy and pity that he has of the
which be^y^ge a sinner may not be saved without his pain / for without his
pain no pain is able to satysfye for sin. Than I exorte the remember his
great gentylnes and learn to suffer for him again / and in part recompense for
his great gentylnes and for thyn offense For sythen he that was an Innocent
suffered for the much more thou that art a syuner ought to suffer for thy
self. The hamers of this goldsmythe which is almighty god are not only the
pains and trybulaco^ns which he werketh in the / and by cause thou shall so
think oftentyme that his werkynge is so secret that the reason of man can not
find the cause thereof perfytly / but also the adversaries which he suffers
the to have are his hamers to beat the and forge of the a perfyte vessel by
pacyent sufferynge according to his pleasure and to receive himself here by
grace and in the life to come with the great glory of his eternal felycyte.
And like as the hamer is ordained fynaly to the profit and making of the
vessel and not the vessel to the hamer / and the hamer in making of the
vessel and with the strokes it is hurt in himself and consumes and finally
breketh. So the wretched and reprobate people which inworde and in dread
trouble the chosen childern of our lord they hurt hemselfe / and finally are
brought to destruccyon and dampnacyon thorugh the great malice yt they have to
other / and the pacyent takynges of their malice purges the souls which ye
have the wrong done unto them / and thus their works are profitable to other
and da^pnable to themself. And therefore says Solomon yt the fool serves to
the wyseman. Qui stultus est seruit sapienti. That persone^ is a fool which
wylfully will do that thing whereby it ente^deth to hurt an other and most
hurts himself. And that person is wise which so wisely takes that thing
yt might hurt him that geteth great profit thereby. Tha^ thou which would be
a clean vesseyll and honorable to god suffer the strokes of trybulacyon /
suffer the strokes of troublelers. Also you which would have the crown of
vyctorye in this world and the crown of glory in the life to come / for the
great sufferers are the great cqonuerours. And with the betynge yt they suffer
of pain and trybulacyon their crown is forged on the flethy of there heart.
Than thou which desyrest to have the crown forsake not the strokes of the
hamers / for by these our lord has ordey^ed that thy crown shall be made /
and at such times yt the strokes are most profitable to the when thou with
very faith remembrynge the profytes of a pacyent and charytable heart keep his
perfyte obedyence to our lord and love to thyn enemies that thou can find
in thyn heart to forgive them and hertely to pray for them yt they may have
forgyuenesse of our lord. This fire of charity makes thy work to go forth
spedefully like as the hot metal dylateth and goth abroad underneath the
hamer / yet with this charity you may defend thy right and oppress the malice
of thyn enemy by menes acordynge to Justyce and equity if thy power be thereto
/ and specially when of lykelyhode by great suffrau^ce their malice should
Incresse. Also thou shall sustene that god susteneth with the / for he
susteneth with the and bears the up in suffrynge auersyte by his sustenyng of
the you art borne up that thou fall not under the great strokes of aduersyte
other by bodily death or great vnpacyence or rancour of heart many souls should
have great falls by false worldely prosperyte and they were not keped under
the strokes of aduersyte / and also these strokes they might not abide except
they had supportacyon of the hand of almighty god with these trybulacyons thou
art also sustened and feed and made strong like as the body is made mighty to
bear great burdens by materyall mete. This trybulacyons are bitter but they
purge the soul and make it to grow in perfeccyon of goostly life / wherefore I
counseyll the as the goostly phesycyan of thy soul to refuse not this dysshe
of our lord set it before the / for he has not only tasted this dysshe to
the / but he has plentefully taken himself of hit / as the prophet Jeremye
prophesied upon him. Saturabitur ob probriis. He shall be sacyate said he with
rebukes Thus you shall not think thy self rebuked in that thou haste
trybulacyons and great wrong done to ye in this world / but rather you art
worshyped in ye that thou art called to the dysshe of our lord. Of this dysshe
was feed that holy man Job as he says in his book. Non leuabo caput saturatus
afflictione. I shall not lift up mine head with pain and woo Than as you have
great trybulaco^n and much to suffer thank thy lord god which so largely
prouydeth for the for after the quantyte of trybulacyon shall be the quantyte and
mesure of thy glory and consolaco^n. And therefore as you will have the sweet
receive the sour for thy great swetnesse must come of bytternesse. Also thou
shall sustene that god susteneth in the / for he within the so reteneth the
mocyons of trybulacyons that if he sustened he^ not they should oppress the
down / and therefore follows. Comungere deo et sustine. As who said / draw
thou nyghe and cleue to god for he is fellow to the in this sufferynge and
berynge of trybulacyon / wherefore be not astonysshed in berynge thinking that
the burden pas seth thy power. For he bears with the which will suffer the
no more to bear but acordynge to thy power and the resydue of the burden he
bears it with the. He is so merciful and so gentle that he will suffer no
soul to bear above his power in weight of temptaco^n and trybulaco^n / as the
apostle says. Fidelis deus q no^ paciet^ nos te^ptari vltra quam potestis.
Wherefore complain not of thy burden for he leyeth upon the which best
knows thy power / and no more charge the withal but that thou may be re
and the resydue he bears himself / and that is the greter part / and yet in
that part thou berest thy self he helps the and comfort the / for
without him thou may no thing do / as he says in the gospel of saint
Johan. Sine me nichil potestis facere. Wherefore all ye which desire to have
the life of Joye I counseyll you pacyently to take this life of trybulaco^n /
for by the storkes of trybulacyon ye are made able to receive and strong to
retene ye grace of our lord whereby ye shall shortly be delivered from all
trybulacyon and come to the plentefulnesse of the flood of delectaco^n which
shall flow upon you tro the great essencyall mageste of god / and so
replenysshe you that all your power shall be sacyate eternally after this
little and short pain of this tra^sytorye life.

THe eight consolaco^n is to remember ye pain and trybulacyon makes the to
seche and labor for the solace above in heaven. For naturally every man and
woman has apetyte to solace and delectacyon / wherefore when they are put
therfro in this lyte by bitter trybulacyon than their mind renneth for to have
it in the other world. For in this life and there both no man may fulfylle his
appe tyte after his pleasure / for after the ordinance of god great pleasure in
this life he has ordained great pai ne for it in that life / for this pleasure
is not without myserye of sin / and great pain here he has ordained great
pleasure for it there. Wherefore trybulacyon in as much as it excludes fro the
and Interdy^eth erthely pleasure and solace / so much it prouydeth and opens
to the the heavenly solace. Like wise as the lord of the town where as great
plente of wine is for to be sold / as in the contre there it grows / he will
make the taueners of the town to be shette up to such a time that he have
uttered his own wine. So our lord makes the tavern of this world to be
shette up to the by trybulacyon to such a time that thou have bought his wine
of consolacyon by merytes of this life. So if you wylt have wine of consolaco^n
thou must go to him / as the prophet Johell says. Bestie agri quasi area
sciciens inspexeru^t ad te quoma^ excecati sunt fontes aquarum. He calls the
bestes of the field flesshely affeccyons and desires of our heart / and the
wells of the waters he calls the plesures of sensual delectacyon. Which
when they are dried with aduersytees they coustreyne the heart to look upward
to heaven for drink for than it can find none in earth and feign it would
drink. And so much the glory of god and the pleasure of the perfyte Joye is
more desired of ye heart. And in this also he shows to the his special
goodenesse which makes all things so bitter to the that no thing thou haste
pleasure to think on but only of him. Wherefore says saint Austen in his
confessyons. Paciebar in cupiditatibus amarissimas dissicultates to propicio
tanto magis quamto minus sinebas dulcescere quod tu non eras. In my desires of
worldely plesures I found most bitter dyffycultees* for thorugh thy mercy
thou would suffer no thing to be sweet to me but only thy self. But
perauenture thou wylt say. Sir I complain me not of the closy^ge of this er
thely tavern so that the tavern above were opened to me that I might have
some sweet dra^ught of the wine of contemplacyon fro thens / but I feel that
all the tauerners are closed to me / for no solace mine heart fyndeth neither in
bodily ne in gostely things. To this I answer that not withstandyn ge that
the tavern bynethe is shette up / yet thou shall not marvel why the tavern
aboufe is not opened anon to the. For after the shettynge of this you must
desire the lord thereof to open it to the and besechynge him oftentyme that he
will open it to the / for the desiring of the opening is to the encresse of
thy merit for the seeking of the delight and goostly swetnesse is of more
merit than to delight and have delectacyon in him for that goostly swetnesse
comes only of him / but the labor whereby thou art ordained to have his
comfort comes both of him and of the by his grace whereby the deeds of thy
soul and of thy body are acceptable to him. And therefore be not mysmade if
thou abide a while at the tavern door before it be opened to the For the longer
thou abydest at the door knocking the more thou shall have when it is brought
to the suffer thy thurst to wax for the more delectable the wine shall be to
the. Dauyd the prophet forsook the plesures of the world for to have the
goostly so lace from above and by cause he haddehem not anon he complained him
as he that had paid his silver and might not have his penyworth. And there he
says. Quid enim michi est in celo et a te quid voluit super terram. Lord what
solace have I desired to have in erthely things / as who said none / and yet
thou gyuest me no solace from heaven Thus he speaks in the person of a
sekesoule and Impotente to abide the ordynate workinges of god but in manner
complayneth as god were in defaute to whom our lord may answer and say /
friend I thank the that thou haste forsaken the plesures of the world for me
/ but yet thou haste not deserved only to have forgyuenes of all such
dysplesures as thou haste done in the world / and much more to have the
plesures of me which be ordained for hy^ that are made clean and perfytly
purged fro their offenses whereby they have dysplesed me. To this saying yet he
answers in the person of a frail soul thus. Uelociter exaudi me defecit
spiritus meus. Good lord here me hastily and grant me that I desire for my
soul faynteneth me for taryenge and it may not longer abide. But after the
great and continued desire of god he sends such comfort that the soul than
says. Deus cordis mei et pars mea deus ineternum. Thou art the god of mine
heart and my part everlasting. For only thou may cause the Joye which I fe
le in mine heart / and of that great Joye that thy childern shall have in the. I
trust that I shall with them be partener euerlastyngly. Ever complain of thy
self and think thou art not worthy to have goostly comfort of god thy
wretchedness is such wherefore beseech him that he will comfort the^ in thy
faith that thou fall not in dyspere by the subtle craft of the devil which
labors all that he can to dyscomforte the. Set not thyn heart on worldely
comfort ne desire not of god the goostly comfort but in that time that it
plese his mercy to give it the. Meke thy self and thou shall have the more /
as saint Peter says Humiliamini sub potentem anu dei et ipse exaltabit vos.
Meke your self under the almighty hand of god and he shall exalte you /
wherefore I counsel the derely and thankefully to take trybulacyon for this
withdraws thy^ heart fro transytorye and vain delectaco^ns of this world
and makes the desire delectaco^n in thy lord god which is most natural to
thy reasonable nature in whom shall be thyn eternal Joye and felycyte.

THe nynthe consolaco^n is to remember howthat trybulaco^n brings god in to
ye mind and makes the soul to think on god and to bear him in remembrance
/ which without pain and trybulacyon should little be thought upon. Wherefore
our lord sends trybulaco^n as propters and rememberes to a dulle mind. And
so when he beteth the by trybulacyon he techeth the to know him and Joyneth
himself to thy soul by knowledge and when thou sufferes the trybulaco^ns
pacyently for the love of him than thou Joynest thy self to him And the more
thy pain and trouble be the more tra thou remembered of god. Thou shall
understand here that the Infenyte mind of god knows all things togydre
which ever are or ever shall be more dystynctly and perfytly than any mind
create of angel or man may understand on things by himself. And he may no
thing forgete / for than he should be mutable fro knowledge to Ignorance but
after ye manner of speaking of scripture is said that our lord forgeteh such as
he loves not and sets not by after the common speaking as we say / this man
knows not me when he takes little keep of me. So our lord such as he
loves he knows by the knowledge of approbacyon ordeynynge him to reward and
great Joye with him. This knowledge he has not of wretched folk yt he prayseth
not he approbateth them. And those after scripture our lord thinks upon
which he sends comfort in trybulacyon and delyuerau^ce in ouercomynge in
temptaco^n and encresse of grace and well spen dynge of time / by good labor
and occupacyon wherefore if you would be Joined to god in thought where is the
rote of thy salvation and in forgetynge of him the rote of dampnacyon be glad
of trybulacyon for this well taken knytteth the and god to gyder by blessed
medytaco^n in thy sufferynge / see thy mind run to him and than doubtless his
renneth to the. The bitter trybulacyons of this life make the thought^ of Ihesu
christ to habonde and multeplye in the hertes of his friends like as the thought
of man when he is in trouble lightly will run to his friends which he
trusted that specially might help him in his vexacyon / and such time this
friend comes ofter in his mind than an other time. And thus our lord by his
suffreayne purueau^ce ordey^eth medytaco^ns of him to be multeplyed in the
minds of his friends to the gretter encresse of grace and virtue in hem.
Wherefore in trybulacyon recomforte the in ye that you art thereby life up by
medytaco^n to almighty god / and has excluded fro the yt vain thoughts
which were wont to occupye thy mind right unprofitable / and the god
thoughts well ordained to our lord more profit the without mesure than any
bodily good which trybulaco^n may take fro ye and in token that his mind is
much on his servants which are in trouble he says in the book of Exodi.
Uidi afflictionem populi mei et recordatus sum pacti mei. I have seen the
trybulacyon of my people and I am remembered of the covenant and promysse that
I have made to hem. As who says thou that art in trouble if thou take thy
trouble pacyently our lord has made a co^uenau^t to work avail thereof
which as you shall know hereafter ye it shall be to thy most profit / king
Dauyd when his own sone Absolon had put him fro the kingdom and he went
like an outlawe from place to place for salvation of himself. One that was
called Symey a wretched man when he see him he scorned him and cursed him and
cast at him stones and the foul stynkynge derte / and when the servants of
Dauyd would have been upon him to have stryken him and to have revenged their
master. Dauyd commanded they should not do so saying thus. Dimitte eum vt
mala dicat si forte respiciat dn^s et reddat michi bonu^ pro maladictioe^s hac
hodierna. Suffer him let him allone in cursynge and rebu king me / for by this
sufferynge I trust god will reward me / and for this cursynge pacyently taken
he will give me some good reward. Thus Dauyd would suffer the cursynge and
Iniurye of his enemies as the mean to make him to have special help of our
lord in his great need when his own sone persued him to put him to death.
Therefore suffer thou pacyently the evil saying and Iniuryes of evil folk /
such brings the to the blessing and specyal help of our lord in such
things there thou haste special need of his help. I said before that our
lord remembers his covenant to such as be in trybula cyon. Here thou will
ask me what covenant that it is. He makes covenant with such as pacyently
ta ke trybulacyon to deliver hem and that they shall have power of delyuerau^ce
/ and that he shall be fellow with hem as long as they are in trybulacyon in
berynge the trouble as it is said before. This is fygured in the book of
Danyell when he and his fellow were put in the brennynge oven there appeared one
with hem like the sone of god which made the oven as so temperate as it had been full of aprety cold wind with a temperate dew therewith that the fire
hurt them not in the oven but it flow out of the oven upon such as kyndeled
the fire and de stroyde them / and those in the oven were delivered. Like wise
if thou blyssedly take trybulacyons and bliss god like as the three childern
blyssed god which were in the oven than thou shall have delyueraunce / and the
trybulacyons shall be cast on thyn adversaries which brought the to trouble
by the help of Ihesu christ the sone of god which if thou feloushyp with him
with thyn heart shall swage the fire of aduersyte and brenne them thereby which
blows and kyndeled the fire upon the. Also our lord makes promysse to his
friends ye which are in trybulacyons that he shall reward them with the
goods of his glory and more than thou may conuenyently ask of him than the
delyuerau^ce of thy pains and troubles and rewards of his excellent goods in
his kingdom of glory. And this covenant is written there he says. Cum ipsosum
in tribulacione eripia^ eum and glorificabo eum. with my friend I am in
trybulaco^n I shall deliver him and I shall glorefye him. Than sythen it is so
profitable to the to have god in thy mind with feere to offend him / and to
this great avail thou art brought by trybulacyon / than I counseyll the which
would be the lover of our lord and have him to thy reward after this life
whom thou haste specially in thy mind the time of trybulacyon that thou take
pacyently pain and temporal ve^xacyon.

THe tenthe consolacyon is to remember that trybulacyon pacyentely and
tha^kfully taken makes our lord more merciful to the / it makes thy prayer
more merytoryous and sooner to be except of god which has ordained that mercy
shall be had through asking of him. Wherefore such duly souls as will not
ask mercy our lord be teth them to make them cry for mercy as the child
does under the rod / wherefore our lord is ready to give mercy to such as
faithfully and perseuerau^t ly call for it at their petycyon and prayer. And
that he accepts the prayer of them is written in the book of Ecclesyastes there
he says Deprecatione^lesi exaudiet dn^s. Our lord shall here the prayer of
such a person as is hurt / wherefore if you feel hurt in ye by pain and
trybulacyo^ comfort thy self again that these hurtes make thy prayers the
sooner to be herd of almighty god for remyssyon of thy synue and to the great
reward of thy salvation. Our lord beteth such as he will have saved with pain
and trouble to constreyne them to cry for help by cause he will they shall
understand yt their help comes of him which after long contynuaunce of
cryenge grau^teth them their petyco^n. Many a mouth is closed by prosperyte yt
it cries for none help to god which is opened by aduersyte. And so is written
of Jonas the prophet ye when he fled in to the contre of Tharse he sleped
profu^dly in ye feloushyp there he was as long as the weder was fair and
calm / but when tempest did rise myghtely than he was wakened and to make him
cry for help to his god / the shypman cast him in to the sea there a qualle
received him and swolowed him in to his womb / and there in great fere of his
life among the bowelles of the qualle he cried with fervent spyryte to god
and with contynau^ce / and that cry was herd of god. Such hertes sleep with
Jonas as in thef als Joye and deceyuable prosperyte of this life forgett
themself and are brought to ye state yt they little atende ne take heed to any
thing but such as are to their bodily pleasure or bodily hurt and little take heed to things of their dampnaco^n or saluaco^n / and the more prosperyte they
have ye faster they are on sleep / and their sleep is the more peryllous and
the more kyghe they are to dampnaco^n. But like as prosperyte makes them to
sleep / like wise aduersyte makes them to wake And there they hold them
stylle in slepynge there they cry when they are waking. And for this cause
our lord makes to rise great tempests of trybulacyons to such folk that be
profou^dely in this peryllous sleep. For he will that they cry on him and
hertely beseech him for such things as he will give them, For like wise he
has ordained what he will give them / also he has ordained that they shall
come thereby by petycyons and by asking of him. And therefore says Dauyd in the
person of such as have their help of god by their petycyon and prayer. Ad
dn^m cu^tribularer clamaui et exaudiuit me. When I have been troubled I have
cried to god and he has herd me and granted me my petycyon. Such folk as
are in prosperyte they call sometime to our lord / for many which are in
prosperyte the are not brought so fast on sleep yt they forgete themself and
god like as they do which are very foles / yet in time of prosperyte the
souls are slomerynge toward slepynge so yt the cry is not so mighty to
obtain the help of our lord as in time of aduersyte. Perauenture you wylt
say to me / that the pain and aduersyte which thou have incombred thyn heart
so sore yt you less prayest and less call to god the time of aduersyte than
in time of prosperyte. To this I say that if thou speak no word in the time
of thy pain / but only apply ye to take it pacyently than thy pain cries
for the. For as many sores and Infyrmytees as Lazarus had in his body / as
many mouths he had cryenge to god. And if thou have but a little prayer with
thy heart or mouth that time the virtue of well taking thy trybulacyon makes
it of great merit and derely to be received of god. As many trybulaco^ns as
thou haste and take them well thanking god of them / as many proptours and
advocates thou haste in the court of heaven to speak for the and call before
the trone of god for expedyco^n and help for the. And thus if thy mouth be
shette at sometime for grieve and bytternesse yt thou felest by trybulacyo^ / thy
trybulaco^n than cries for the with a great voice in the herynge of god /
trybulaco^ns also make thy prayers sooner to speed. Thy trybulacyons are as
paymentes for the charter of thy delyuerau^ce / therefore pacyently suffer
trybulaco^ns as thou will have the letters of thy delyuerau^ce. And of this
gives the example that holy man. Job which speaks as he that had long time
abyden at the court desiring to have his letters and has not to pay for
them. Quis michi det vt veniat peticio mea et quod exspectabo tribuat michi
dn^s. who shall give me that my petycyon may come to me and that our lord shall
give to me those things which I desire of him. And specially among all other
prayers the (Pater noster) is most special. And that thou may well
understand when he gaaf it to the by his own mouth for he himself knows
best what petycyon most pleseth him. He not weary to cry notwithstanding
that you haste not soon delyuerau^ce after thyn own will at the court of our
lord / for he knows the order of his court wherefore it is most expedyent
that thou submytte thy will to his besechynge him that after the order of his
will he will deliver the / and than thou shall be sure of blyssed delyuerau^ce /
and you which thus abydest that thou gracyously labor for thy delyuerau^ce.
The wretched people take not themself as abyders / for he that abides he
hops to have some thing / but these men look for no reward of their
trybulaco^ns They abide for no thing but for worldely good worshype or solace
/ their hertes be so fixed in these worldely goods that they look little to
the goods of heaven and the reward of god. The ryghtwysse people which see by
the ryghtwysnesse of god that no sin may pass unpunished / they desire of
god to have labor and trybulacyon in this world whereby they may escape ye
bitter pains and tourmentes the which ben ordained for sinners that have
little pain in this world / and they Joye of their trybulacyon. For the pain
which is pacyently taken for the love of god in this world it purges not
only the soul fro sin / but also it ordeyneth great Joye after this world.
And the pain the which is suffered after this life it only profyteth to
purgacyon of sin in such as depart fro this life in the state of grace.
Wherefore the holy man Job says. Qui cepit verberare me ip^e conterat me. He
which has begonnen to beat me he spare me not but beat me enough / and in
that only I will comfort me for that he gives me so great pain and sorrow
and that he spares me not. O take good head of this holy soul which had
lost all his richesse / all his childern / all his bodily health that the
flesh fell roten fro his boones / and was despised of his friends / and
scorned of his wife. And yet all his sufferaunce he held it but as a
beginning of his betynge and besought god to beat him fully / as who would
say / that god had but little done to him in all these / and other comfort
he had not ne none other he desired to have but that god would not spare him.
He understood that his betynge was payment to obtain his letters of
delyueraunce / and therefore he besought god that he would give him payment
enough that he should not be tarried after his delyueraunce in defaute of
payment. Also he understood that such as our lord spares in this life he
spares them for to be beten after this life. And such as that our lord
loves he beteth them in this life because that he will spare them after this
life. The wretched folk are spared here by the great wrath and great ire of
god for he will here after him revenge of them. And therefore Job desired to
make all his paymenthere. Thus if that thou be dyscomforted in that that thou
art gretely beten with pain and trybulacyon / thou must comfort thy self
again in remembrynge how that our lord loves the and will spare the in time
coming. Our lord will not beat the twyes for one thing when as one betynge
is suffycyent / and the suffycyence is made by a good will and by the good
taking of betynge. For one gentle and obedyent will makes a little pain as
acceptable to god for remyssyon of sin and encresse of grace as any great
pain without such a good will. For as it is written in Genesis. Respexit deus
ad abel et ad munera sua. Our lord did behold Abell and his offerynges.
^yrste he be held his heart and his good entente / and than his gifts / as
who would say / he made more of his good and his loving heart than he did of
his gifts / for there is no gift acceptable to god except it come of a good
heart. Thus this holy fader Job offered his pain to god with a good heart and
with a good will when he desired that he should not spare him and all was by
cause that he would that he should spare him in an other place / and therefore
like as he desired to be beten here also he desired for to be spared there.
Wherefore he says thus. Parce michi domine. Lord spare me. wherefore I counseyl
the which our lord here does vysyte with pain and trouble that thou thank
him thereof which so lovely remembers the that he will in time to come spare
the in that place where the wound of his stroke shall never be heled for the
sin which deserves forgyuen after this life standing thou know thy
self a sinner and must needs be beten. I counseyll the take thy betynge so
that it may be profitable to the and avoid the betynge in time comy ge / for
else thou shall be beten both here and there here thy wound may be heled but
there it shall never be heled.

THe. xi. consolacyon is to remember how the heart is keped and nourysshed by
trybulacyon. Our lord has ordained that the goods of the heart shall be under
ye keeping of trybulaco^n / and with out such keeping of time they are lost as it
was preu^n in the wise man Solomon of whom saint Gregorye says. Ideo sapi^a
cor salomonis deseruit quia nulla tribulaco^is disciplina illud custodiuit. The
wysedom of god did forsake the heart of Solomon for no dyscyplyne of
trybulacio^ did it keep. For like as the fire is keped under the ashes and the
sede under the snow / like wise the her tes of the friends of our lord are
keped under the covering of trybulacyon. In token of this our lord commanded
that his tabernacle should be covered with here which is sharp to the entente
that this sharp covering should defend the precious curtens of sylke which
was vndertheym So our lord covered the souls of his lovers with sharp
trybulacyonsto the intent that the great tempests of flesshely / temptacyons
shall not fade the fair ornaments of virtue which clotheth the soul. And
this trybulacyon brings in to our mind the miserable state of our nature how
soon it is brought to sickness of body / temptacyon of soul by Inordynate
pleasure of malice and of will and how unable it is to bear perfytly the weight
of any trybulacio^ but only by the specyal supportaco^n of the grace of our
lord. And thus we are made^ by trybulacyon to me ke our self where as
prosperyte made us to have more pleasure in our self than we ought to have /
and made us hyer in our conceyte than we should have be. And therefore of such
that have no trybulacyon in this life it is written in the spalter. Cu^ hoi^bus
no^ flagellabunt^ ideo tenuit eos superuia Such as are no^ scourged by
trybulacyon they are holden with the vice of pride / wherefore thou which art a
prisoner with pride as thou may understand in that thou haste to much love
to thy self and to little to god / thousholde pray our lord to beat the and
to break this band of Inordynaie love. For as long as thou haste this love to
thy self thou may not have that love to god which that thou ought to have
Thou may know when that pride has possessyon of thy soul by the effects
and we^kes that grow of pride / as when thou art meued to say things
commendable of thy self to the entente that thou should be commended having
no respect to god ne to the co^mendacyon of him. This auayntynge and boostynge
grows of the vice of pride and when that thou art dysobedyent and froward
and will follow rather thyn own will than the counseyll and bidding of such
which speak to the for thy profit and is dysposed to chyde and to braulle
with the when thy will is not fulfilled. Also trybulacyon does nourysshe thyn
heart as it is written in Deutronomye. Inundaciones maris quasi lac sugges. Thou
must souke the bitter floodes of trybulacyon as they were milk / like as the
child souked the milk to the encresse of the bodily help and health. So thou
must souke the bitter trybulaco^n to thy goostly health / for if thou take them
swetely than thou growest in virtue and in the grace and favor of our lord
wherein stands the health of thy soul / wherefore in thy trybulaco^n comfort
the with this milk which shall bring upon the sweet flood of the glory of
god.

THe. xii. consolacyon in the time of trybucyon is to remember that
trybulacyons do testefye and bear witness to thyn heart that our lord does
special love the / and therefore thou ought to receive them gladdly / for they
come for to bear witness that thou shall have the grettest thing and of the
most valor that thou may desire in this life which is the love of god. And
this shows Solomon where as he says. Qui diligit filium assiduat illi
flagella. The fader which that loves his child he beteth him oftentimes.
Thus our lord keeps his childern ever underneath some rod / for he beteth
not always with one rod for sometime he beteth by trouble of the soul /
sometime by pain of the body / and sometime when it seems that he spares and
yet he beteth. As when he suffers the to goo at lyberte and thou thynkest thy
self out of trouble / yet he suffers the thoughts and temptacyons to come in
thy mind as that thy consyence is grieved and there he beteth the / and thus he
spares the sometime in betynge and he beteth the in sparynge. But such as he
sparetij in this life / he ordained that after this life that al his scourges
shall come upon them al at ones in the bitter pain of dampnacyon. And than he
shall auau^ce and promote to the great and endelesse prosperyte to his childern
which he has beyet in this life. And there shall be showed the great love of him
which he did beat in this life / and the hatred and wrath of them which he
spared in this life / for than he shall cast of him to gydre all his
vengeance and all the tourmentes and pains which they deserve here shall be
hylled upon them there as our lord says in the book of Deutronomye.
Congregabo super eos mala et sagittas meas complebo in eis. I shall geder to
gydre the pains upon them and I shall stryke them fully with mine arowes. Than
thou which desyrest to have the love of our lord and to know that he loves
the / be glad when the witness of his love comes to the. Perauenture thou
say that prosperyte is also witness of his love / for such as our lord
loves sometime receive prosperyte of hy^ like as other time they receive
aduersyte / and thus thou say that sythen both come from one hand and one
manner of folk yt the one is no more witness of the love of god than the
other. To this I answer that not withstanding that both prosperyte and
aduersyte come of our lord / yet the most token of love is aduersyte more
than prosperyte. For that is the most token of love which the fader of heaven
gives to him yt heloueth best / but he gaaf to our savior his sone and his
blyssed mother whom he loved best most trybulacyon in this life and little
prosperyte / wherefore aduersyte is the most sure token of love. Also sythen
our savior come in to this world as a merchant in to a feyre to chose ye
good and leave the evil as ysaye says. Ut sciat eligere bonu^ and reprobare
malu^. But this wise our lord refused prosperyte and the kingdom of Jure when
it was offered to him and chose aduersyte and great labor and pain all his
life / and with the most bytterest death ends his life. Than if thou wylt be
awyfe merchant follow him which can not be deceived in his marchau^dyse. Than
chese with him here trybulaco^n / and thou shall have with him the Infenyte
Joye and consolacyon.

THe. xiii. conforth in trybulacyon is to remember that if thou suffer thy
pain and trybulacyon pacyently than you make a great conquest of thy goostly
enemies and utterly confou^dest all their malice. For all their labor is to
make the to take thy trybulaco^n with grutchynge and a woeful heart because
thou art let thereby fro such plesures as thou art dysposed to have if thou
were without such pain and trouble. Wherefore if thou take thy trouble
pacyently and with a meke and obedyent heart referrynge it as a mean and merit
to come to ye everlasting. Joye and pleasure. And yt you haste a will not to be
sor^ in that thou art let by trybulacu^n for those dysceyuable plesures which
should make the to lose this pleasure of eternal felycyte / than thou obteynest
vyctorye of the fendes which tempte the to the contrary / and they shall have
more pain after that they be^ conquered / therefore says the prophet. Perdes
o^s qui tribula^t ai^am mea^. Thou shall undo and punysshe all those which
trouble my soul And of every fend that thou getest the better of / thou shall
have the place of glory in heaven which he should have had if he had not
fallen as Orygenes says of these words in Deutro? Omnis locus que^ calcauerit
pes vester. vester erit. And scripture says that these holy and gracyous
souls which overcome and break the purpose of the devil / they. I^lude him
and deceive him as Dauyd says. Draco iste quem formasti ad illudendum ei. This
dragon the fend thou haste made him that should be deluded and deceived which
at all time labors to deceive. For good souls use the temptacyons of ye
devil contrary to his entente / for by those things they are meke whereby he
would bring them to pride / and by that they are pacyent whereby he would make
them impatient / and by those things they are brought to chastyte whereby he
would bring them to lecherye. And thus they give him a fall in his own
turn and with that same croke they cast him down / with the which he
intended for to have wrasteled them down. O how glad may thou than be
which pacyently haste taken aduersyte. For by the merytes of this life thou
have deserved to have full domynaco^n of thyn enemies at the hour of death than
they shall be aferde of the for than thou shall be confermed in grace and shall
have power to tie and to bind them like as the bear warder and keeper by^deth
his beres. For thou which put them to fere and shame in this life
resystynge their temptacyous thou must than be terryble to them for than you
shall receive thy great power of god in reward of thy batayl / wherefore thou
which would have a Joyful hour of death take pacyently pains and troubles of
this life.

THe. xiiii. consolacyon is to remember that if thou take trybulacyon pacyently
you drawest to the the merciful look of our lord / and mekest him with great
pleasure to behold the / and of this may thou be Joyful that any thing
should be in the wherefore our lord should have a special pleasure to behold
the / for this thou may be sure that if he have pleasure to look on the / by
that look thoushalt have profit of him / wherefore pacyently suffer a while for
you shall be sure that of this sufferau^ce shall grow great profit. This
profit you may not look to have hastly / for after the order of wysedom of
our lord it mufte have a time in growing. Like as ye husband man looks not
for repyng of his corn as soon as he has sown it. Our lord is nothasty in
his werkyng but does al thing by time and delyberaco^n as you may see in ye
works of nature. Thy nails and thy here grows co^tynualy but they grow so
softely that ye may not perceive their growing look upon them as perfytely
as you can / and yet by process of time you may see yt they be grown under
thyn eyes yet thou perceyuest not Like wise grace and great virtue grows in
thy soul by pacyent taking of aduersyte / and that you shall well perceive if
thou perseruer in pacyence / thus virtue grows yet tho you perceyuest it not.
Than specially our lord has pleasure to look on the when thou take
trybulacyons to the intent that he does se^de them to the / that is to say /
as penance for that you haste sinned / and to obtain thereby grace and virtue.
And that by thy pacyent and thankful sufferynge you shall give good example to
such as do know thy trouble. And than thou may say as it is written in the
book of Trenos. Uide dn^e qm^ tribulor. Behold lord for I am troubled. As who
said / well taken trouble is the cause that thou lokest on me / and this
trouble thus taken makes of crooked souls ryghtwysse souls / of the whom
Dauyd says. Oculi dn^i superiustos et aures eius ad preces corr. The eyes of
our lord are set upon ye ryghtwysse men / and his eeres are nyghe to their
prayers. But you wylt peradventure say that also he beholds wret che men /
for it follows. Uultus aute^ dn^i super faciences mala. The face of our lord
is upon them that done much evil / but attend ye then what follows in the
same verse. Ut perdat de terra memo riam eorr. Our lord looks on the wretched
men to the intent that after a little while they shall never be remembered after
to ye honor of god and their co^mendacyon. But by the good souls which here
pacyently take trybulacyon our lord shall ever have honor / and they also
shall have perpetuell laud and co^mendaco^n / like as we see in the church of
god co^ tunuall honor done to god by such as have gretely suffered for god and
for their sins in this life. There was never king in this world which had so
great honor as now have some saints which was before time but a poor man or
a poor woman and in their time were little set by among the people of the
world. And therefore says the prophet. Nimis honorati su^t amici tui deus.
Thy friends good lord are hyghely honored. Of ye rich man of whom is spoken
in the gospel of Luke which was clothed in purple and rychely fed every
day ye people of this world did look and did him gretereuerence / but
almighty god little attended hy^ ne the company of heaven / for he little
attended the people of our lord / and contrary wysefewe gave keep to the poor
lazar that lay at his door and desired but the cro^mes that fell from his
table and none was given him / but almighty god and the heavenly creatures
beheld him lyeng with great pain before the gates of this rich man. And that
was showed in their departing fro this life / for there was send of god a
ryall Imbasset of angels to receive the soul of the lepre and to bring it
with great Joye in to Abraham's bosom. And the soul of the rich man which had
prosperyte and felycyte of this world was buried in hell and there it is yet
for in hell is no redempcyon. These the now whether thou wylt that the sight
of our lord be set upon the for thy pacyence in the time of thyn aduersyte and
thereby to have this comfort when thou shall depart fro this world / or to
have thy pleasure after the transytorye course of this worldely prosperyte and
in manner be forgeten of god and the dwellers of heaven / and at the hour of
death to be taken with the terryble tyrau^tes of hell / and thither to be
brought to dwell without hope of remyssyon of sin or delyuerau^ce of pain
ever without end. There was never Emperor ne king that had so great pleasure to
see his servant fight for his love as almghty god has in the why che that
beren pacyently trybulaco^n against all the malice of the deuylles for his sake.
There is no great evil done in this life but it is soon showed amon ges the
company of hell / so there is no great thing of perfeccyon done ne suffered in
this life but it is showed to the court of heaven to their great Joye. Than see
that you suffer Joyfully pain and trybulary on as you wylt that god and the
heavenly multitude have Joye in the and gretely desire that you shall be fellow
with them in their beatytude and felycyte.

THe xv. consolacyon is to remember that our lord sends the trybulacyon to
make the to come to knowledge not only how thou should rule thy self according
to the pleasure of him / but also that he has ordained the to be a teherof
other. For like as none can so comfortably dele with a seek perlone as the
phesycyan which has been in the same sickness before / so none can give so
comfortable a counseyll to a soul in trouble as that person the which before
time has had such atrouble / and by the grace of god has well gyded hem
self therein. As saint Poule says. Tribulamur pro vestra exhortaco^e et
salute. We are troubled for your exhortacyon and goostly health. As who said.
Our lord sends us trouble to the entente that we should teache you both by
example of pacyence sufferynge / and also by holy exortacyonon of word that ye
be obedyent for the great reward which is ordained for pacyence in trouble.
And that by like resons as we find in our self by the Inwardely techynge of
our lord whereby we more Joyfully take trybulacyon such or like we should
show to you for to make you like wise pacyently to soffre aduersyte / and like
as the good soul whicho is in trouble techeth an other both in word and in
deed how it shall pacyently and holyly and take trybulaco^n so yt it has
ordained for it double reward in ye glory of god. Thus you shall have reward
of god in that you pacyently suffres sickness and trouble than kefully in thy
self. Also thou shall have reward in that you show thy pacyent taking to
other to the entente to give them good example and to the laud of god
pryncypally and not to thy co^mendacyon Also thou shall have reward in that
thou techest with thy mouth to other after the good mocyons and medytacyons
that you felest in thy self whereby thou felest thy self comforted in thy pain
and trouble And in the Joye of heaven thou shall have synguler reward of glory
by each one of them which are profyted here by thy techynge. And they shall
give the thankynges euerlasty^gly for the goostly help yt they have had of the
here in this life. And so thou which such use thy trybulacyon to the
profit of many thou shall have grace Joye given to the by trybulacyon / as the
prophet Danyel says. Fulgebunt iusti tanquam stelle in perpetuas eternytates
et sicut splendour firmamenti qui ad iusticiam erudiunt multos. The ryghtwysse
men shall shine as sterres / and those the which teache other to live ryghtwysly
shall shine as the hole fyrmament. Thus like as the light of the fyrmament the
which conteyneth the son the moon and the sterres / so the glory of those
that teache other for to do and to suffer virtuously shall pass the glory of
those the which are not such techers. wherefore I counseyll the in the time of
thy pain and trouble that thou apply thy mind dylygently to learn well for
to take thy trouble to the good example of other that thou be nombred among
the glorious multitude of techers.

THe. xvi. comfort is to remember that our lord by the high prouyde^ce of his
wisdom and most right order of his Justyce has made this statute that you
which haste lost him by prosperyte and false Inordynate pleasure of this
world shall find him again by aduersyte of pain and trybulacio^ / as it is
written in the book of Deutro? Inuenies em^ si cu^ toto cord inqueras eu^ and
trybulacione. Thou shall find him if thou seek him with all thyn heart in
trybulacyon. O how glad may thou be which art set by the very ordinance
of our lord in that way and state that thou may find him if thou wylt.
Peradventure thou wylt say Sir if I understood that this pain and trouble yt
I feel at mine heart or in my body came of our lord I would be glad thereof and
it should be welcome to me but I think that I am the cause thereof my self. To
this I say that what soweuer sorrow yt thou haste in heart or pain in body
god is the pryncypall cause thereof / and it is ordained by his will and
ryghtwysnesse that thou shall have it. He gives pain in this world which he
shall give Joye in the other world / and the devil is pryncypall cause of
sinful pleasure in this world which shall tourment and punysshe the vain
occupied souls in the other world. It is laboryous and paynfull to the to
seek god thus with so great fere in trybulacio^ / wherefore in thy seeking
remember the finding of him how Joyful it shall be to the / for thon shall
find him thereby if thou take it thankefully which shall turn all thy pain
in to pleasure / thy sorrow in to solace / thy transytorye aduersyte into the
perdurable Joye and prosperyte. wherefore says the prophet. Letetur cor
que^renciu^ dn^m querite facie^ eius semper. They have cause to have a light
heart which seeks our lord wherefore seek ye the Joyful face of him ever.
The pain of sehynge is bitter but he is sweet whom thou sekest by pain / and
if thou seek him by pain to the intent that you would be a lover of him thy
pain shall apere the lesser as Dauyd says. Letent^ in teoe^s qui queru^tte.
All those which seek the they shall be lyghtned in the. But the beftyall folk
which ordeyne not their pain as a mean whereby they should come to our lord
but only take it as a great hurt to their body / and right little or naught
remember what profit their soul may have thereby they are very woo with all
for they hate more the myserye of pain than the myserye of sin and more
labor to avoid things to their dysplesure than to the dysplesure of god. And
yet our lord keeps such folk in pain to such a time till he have made
them to set little by them self and be more redye to apply them to do after
his will than after their own will / like as the master cesseth not to
punysshe his servant to such a time till he has brought him to work after
his will specially when it is such a servant that he has a favor to him and
will not put him from himself. Thou wylt peradventure say / a they speak
falsely upon me and sclau^der me how can this come of god / for this is dedely
sin / and no sin may be Imputed to god. To this I answer that our lord of
his secret dome and unknown Jugement suffers the to sin / and of that
sin he will work virtue in the and make the to have will to forsake sin /
which will comes of sorrow and confusyon that thou have in thy self / and
this pain of sorrow which thou feleste byte thyn heart right bytterly comes
of god / and also the good will which follows thereof in forsakynge of sin /
and therefore the prophet says. Imple facies eorum ignomina et querent nomen
tuum dn^e. Fulfill the face of their soul with shame and rebuke and than they
shall seek the. And therefore our lord suffers many a soul to fall in great
and openly known sin whereby they have great shame and are brought thereby to
forsake sin / and to set right little by themself which before made to
much of themself / and had great pride and vain glory in the good name
and report that was made upon them And by this common shame and shameful
report which gooth upon them this vain pleasure is clean taken from them.
Thus god is so good that he suffers none evil to be done in the world
neither in his elect childern but of the which that he werketh a great avail
to them. They shall clearly see upon the day of Jugement that like as they
never did good thing unrewarded / so they never did evil thing but our
lord did work great avail thereof to their reward. if thou sekest our lord
in the way of paynfull pouerte and want things as it is seen to the that
it is necessary to thy living and sustentaco^n / remember that if thou
pacyently take thy pouerte thou shall have the greetest richesse that ever was
/ for thou shall have god himself / and all the richesse that he has shall be
thyn. As he says in the gospel. Omnia mea^ tua sunt. All my richesse. are thy
richesse. O than be thou glad to bear thy pouerte Joyfully for a while which
hastily shall be made so rich. It were a great pleasure to a poor man to have
promised ye richesse of a temporal king / but much more pleasure it is to a
faithful soul to have promised the Inestimable richesse of god which is the
king of kings and lord of lords. Thou say peradventure. Sir I have lost
my bodily health whereby I might have done many good works to the honor of god
and profit of my soul / and fro these I am let now by great sickness and
oftentyme fere of death. I answer the in this / that peradventure when thou
had thyn health thou occupied full symply / and more thou used it to thy
pleasure than to the pleasure of god / and you should have comen to more
Inco^uenyentes thereby if thou had continued therein. And for mysusynge of thyn
health our lord has send the now this seknesse / and there as you would not
serve him well in time of they health in well doing / serve him well now in
time of sickness by good sufferynge. Be thou sure that if thyn health had been
more to his pleasure than sickness / you should have had it standing that he is
the pryncypall cause of all bodily sickness, and there thou lesest thy bodily
health which is better to the than all the richesse of the world yt you getest
again thereby if you gracyously take it which goods pass thy bodily health and
all bodily richesse of the world / that is to say the grace of our lord in
this world with virtue of meekness pacyence and charity / and flesshely pain
is the special remedy to avoid flessly sin for the time of pain ye will
has but little pleasure in remembrance of flesshely delectaco^n / and therefore
if it be tempted it is the more stronger to resyste it / and therefore says the
apostle Cu^infirmor forcior su^. When I am seek in my body I am stronger to
resyste the temptacio^ of vice in my soul. By pain the seek perso^e is
brought to set little by himself / for if it be full of pain it sets
little by precious clothes / it sets little by worship and worldly honor.
And that person is meke which sets little by himself / but pacyence is
more paynful / that is to say wylfully and thankefully to take the sickness
with hand and heart to give loving to our lord therefore / nevertheless a
faith full soul remembry^ge these profytes which come by sickness is full
glad thereof and conformeth ye will to the will of god / but this pacyence to
god must have charity to those which are about it. if thou have these three /
that is to say / meekness in little setting by thy self / obedyent pacyence
to god / charity to such as be about the without chiding and braulynge than
you haste great witness ye which shall bring the to the glory of god and to
the crown of vyctorye. O how glad may thou be to seek thy lord god and
finally to find him by sickness / whoos glorious sight is of so great a
pleasure that thou would chese to suffer the great pains of hell long time
after a short sight so that thou might see him again. And if a soul which is
in the pains of hell might see him / the great Joye of the sight of god
should stop for the time all the pains of hell that hit should feel none /
for that Joye should so fulfill the will with delectaco^n and pleasure that hit
should feel no pain for there should no place be left for any contrary
feeling. In this life there is no pleasure so great but there is pain much more
/ but after this life there shall be pleasure incomparable more than any pain may
be now. I exhort the to seek thy lord truly by trybulaco^n and pain which
has sought the and found the by incomparable more pain than thou which
haste lost him may suffer to find him again.

THe xvii. comfort is to remember that our lord has send trybulaco^n to the
to the entente that he will make the aferde to of offe^de him / for commonly our
freyle nature refuses no thing which is plesaunt to it except it be meoued
of fere / and many there are which in lack of perfyte faith fere right little
the pains to come / wherefore such should be taken in the snares of the devil
and fall to contynuaunce in sin if our lord of his great mercy did not
send them pain and trybulacyon in this present life. But he keeps them so
occupied with fere and bytternesse of pain that there mind is withdrawn fro
their dysordynate pleasure. And if they have yt special grace to thy^ke that
their pain is mind to them from our lord to make them to flee sin / than
their pain and trouble puts them in great fere to sin and makes them to
flee it. Wherefore Job speaking of such says. Terrebit eos tribulacio et
angustia. Trybulacyon and anguysshe shall fere them. Many there are which as
young childern that have little use of reason live al after sensualyte and
pleasure of their flesh and that is their great sport and delight in this
world And often time in the mids of their playnge time without any warning
they are called out of this world to their acounte and Jugement where the
sentence of dampnato^n is shortly given of them and forth with they are put in
to pain of the vengeable fire of hell there they shall abide ever without
end. That soul which flees sy^ne pryncypally for fere of pain or for
worldely shame or for any other creature it shall have no reward therefore in
heaven / but yet by that it offends less to god than it should have done if
it had no such fere and sooner ryseth to grace. This fere of pain is called a
seruyle fere / for thus fereth the seruannt for to offend his master by cause
he fereth he should have great strokes and punysshement. But the good child
fereth his fader pryncypaly for love that he has to hy^ and because he would
not offend him. And right so the good wife loves her husbonde and for love
that she has to him she will not offend him. But the evil wife fereth to make
transgressyon of her spousage more for fere of strokes than for love. Thus the
childely fere of god is merytoryous and shall have great reward of our lord
when a soul flees synue for love yt it has to god / and because it would not
finally be sperate from him. Nevertheless for seruyle dread the soul is
brought to childely dread oftentimes. Than sythen no thing shall depart the
soul fro god and bring it to perpetuell pain but on lysynne / our lord
sends the pain to depart the fro sin / than he will by temporal pain
deliver the fro the eternal pain and Join the to him in perpetuell glory /
wherefore if ye lift thy mind to god in the time of pain and trybulacyon
seeing so faderly he deleth with the / and what profit he ordeyneth to come of
thy pain and trouble thou ought to take it pacyently and give him great laud
and praysynge therefore which thus merciful deleth with the.

THe. xviii. consolacyon is to remember how our lord prouydeth for the which
art in trybulaco^n if you take it well that after thyn heart be constrained to
god with anguysshe of pain it shall be dylated with Joye and opened again / as
the prophet says. In tribulaco^e dilatasti michi. Thou have dylated by
trybulaco^n mine heart to me. And as it is written in the book of Tohbye. Post
tribulacione^ et flectu^ exultacione^ infundis. Thou gyuest to the heart after
trybulaco^n and we pynge Joye and gladness. There is none after the ordynate
law of our lord that comes to great gladness in him but after great
sorynesse of this life / and specially if the sorrow and trouble be taken for
the love of god in order to him / as the prophet says. Detorrente in via
bibet propterea exaltauit caput. He shall drink of the bitter water in the
way of trybulacyon and therefore he shall exalte afterward his head with Joye
in god and delectacyon. That thing which makes man or woman to set less by
hemselfe that same dysposeth hem to make more of god. Some time a person is
made to set less by hemselfe by mysery of sin / for many one which made
right much of himself / when they are fallen in to great and abhomynable
sin than they are ashamed and abhor with hemselfe. And after this little
making of hemselfe they begin to learn to make much of our lord and come
as Mary magdaleyn did to great grace and pleasure in god. By mysery of pain
also many come to the same pleasure in god and that is the better way / for
mysery of sin can never be good / and the time is lost of goostly profit as
long as a soul is in this mysery and our lord hates this wretchedness of
sin. But wretchedness of pain if it be well taken is of great pleasure to our
lord and it is of great merit and the time is well spended they yt be in this
mysery well taken / wherefore I exhort the which haste had pleasure in sin /
and world have pleasure in god take pacyently pain and trybulacyon / and than
thou shall see that thou shall learn to make much of god and he shall make
much of the.

THe. xix. consolacyon is to remember how a dulle soul by trybulacyon is made
quycke to serve god / as the prophet says. Si ambulauero in me dio
tribulaco^is viuificabis me. if I shall walk in the mids of trybulacyon thou
shall receive and quyken me. Like as a dulle servant by strokes is made
sharply to apply his labor / so are dulle souls which had little appetyte
to serve god be made to spend their time ye better in the service of god / and
specially such as have grace to remember what pain that he suffered for them
this faith is quyckenynge and life to them / as saint Poule says. Quod em^
viuo in fide filii dei viuo qui dilexit me et tradidit semetipsu^ pro me. My
life is in the faith of the sone of god which loved me and did offer himself
wylfully to suffer great pains for me. Perauenture thou wylt say. Me think I
served god better when I was out of pain and trybulacyon for than I had my
lyberte of my mind / now I am constrained with pain to have my mind so of
god that I can but ytell remember god beside it. To this I answer that if thou
haste ben well occupied the time of thy prosperyte by good werkynge / now thou
art weloccupyed ye time of thyn aduersyte by good sufferynge / and both these
are requysyte to perfyte living if thou may not multeplye so many good deeds
as thou did before if thou have pacyence in thy trybulacyon than thou haste one
thing that is worth many things / and this virtue of pacye^ce can never be
had but in sharp aduersyte / like as the sweet rose grows on the sharp
thorns / so grows this sweet and soft virtue of pacyence of the sharp
thorns of pain and trybulacyon / wherefore I counseylle the to take pacyently
thy trybulacyon and thank god hertly thereof / and than thou haste the virtue
of perfyte sufferynge which shall obtain of our lord after thy pain be
paste the virtue of good doing.

THe. xx. consolacyon and comfort in time of trybulacyon is to remember how it
werketh to the the precious crown of glory as the prophet Ysaye says.
Dominus coronabit te tribulacione. Our lord shall crown the by trybulacyon.
Thus all the blyssed multitude in heaven have geten their crowns of whom the
angel said to saint Johan euangelyst. Hii sunt qui veneru^t ex magna
tribulacione sed absterget deus lacrimas ab oculis sancto^ et iam non erit
amplius neque luctus neque dolor qm^ priora transierunt. These are those which
have comen fro great trybulacyo^ / but our lord shall wype away the teeres
fro the eyes of the holy folk and they shall never after have weeping ne
sorrow for all the first occasyons of sorrow are passed with these that are in
bliss. And it is Impossyble that they should feel the least pain or sorrow
that might be thought. Thus the appostle writes of our savior. Humiliauit
semet ipsum factus obediens vsque ad morte^ morte^ autem crucis propter quod
deus exaltauit illum et donauit illi nomen quod est super omne nomen vt in
nomine thesu omne genu flectatur celestium terrestrium et infernorum. Our
savior did make himself obedyently to the great pain and trybulacyo^ of the
cross / wherefore the fader has given him a name above all names that in the
name of Ihesu every knee be bowed of heaven of earth and of hell / That is to
say / that all creatures shall be obedyente to him which was so obedyente to
the will of the fader for to suffer so great pain and so great trouble. Thou
which desyrest to come to the great felycyte and Joye of god / thou may not
look to have rest and pleasure in this life / for none may have the false
felycyte of his world and the true felycyte of that other world / wherefore
the apostles of god did forsake the plesures of this world and took them to a
paynfull life / as the apostle says. Nos stulti propter xp^m infirmi et
ignobiles esurimus. sicimus. nudi sumus. colaphis cedimur. instabiles ^umus.
laboramus manibus nr^is operantes. maledicim^ et vn^dicimus persecucion^patimur
and sus^^nemus* blasphemamur et obsecramus. ta^quam purgamenta huius mundi
sumus dim peripsima. We are says saint Poule of himself and the other
apostles taken as so les for that we live as the dyscyples of christ / and are
taken as folk of little valor / and as little to be set by / we are hongry /
we are thyrst / we labor for our lyunge with our hands werkynge / we are
beten / we have no place to abide in / we are naked wantynge clothes / the
folk curse us and we bless them / they pursue us to hurt us and we suffer
them / they speak dyshonourably of us and we pray for them / we are reputed as
the fylth of the street and as the paring of an apell which as no profit is
cast away The lives of these holy apostles were all in trouble and pain /
and now they be replenysshed with Joye and shall never have pain / therefore
arm the with pacyence to take pain and trybulacyons / for though they stynge
sharply now they shall bring the to trete swetnesse. Therefore says the
prophet. Circu^dederu^t me sicut apes. They have comen about me as bees / ye
be styngeth but she brings forth sweet wax and honey. So trybulaco^ns they
stynge sharp but they bring forth ye wax of goostly works which shall
brenne clearly in the soul with the clear sight and vysyon of god and also the
honey of the fruycyon of god Thou than which would come to this blyssed vysyon
and glorious fruycyon of god / learn in this life to love trybulaco^n for the
great Joye and consolacyon which thou shall have by trybulacyon. Remember that
our lord has ordained the in this life to have no rest but trouble and
battle as the holy man Job says. Milicia est enim vita hominis super terra^.
The life of man upon the earth stands in battle and in knyghthode. Thou
must battle with thy flesh in time of health with fasting / watchynge / and
with sharp clothing prayng and with great labourynge / and in the time of
sekeuesse thou must fight ayenstit with pacyence and Joyful sufferynge and
gyuynge therefore synguler loving to our lord. Thou must fight with the
world in fleing evil feloushypp and evil examples thereof and do good against
evil. Thou must fight against the evil thoughts and evil suggestyons of the
devil by great labor to put them soon out of thy mind / and labor to lift
thyn heart to god and for to get good thoughts against the evil. Thus I
counseyl the to fight this good battle of faith that thou may have in
reward everlasting life / that in the day of thy departing you may say
with saint Poule remembrynge thy life. Bonu^ certamen certau^* cursu^ consu^mam
fidem seruaui. de reliquo reposita est michi corona iusticie qua^ reddet michi
dn^s in illa die iustus iudex. I have made the time of mylyfe a good battle /
and now I have made an endeof the course of this life. I have keped my faith /
now I trouste in my lord to receive the crown of right wysnesse which crown
in that day when I shall come to him the right wys Juge shall give it me^. Our
lord Ihesu by the merytes of his passion give us grace pacyently in this life
to take according to his will this temporal trybulacyon whereby we may be
delivered from the endelesse dampnacyon. And of the hand of our lord to
receive the crown of our gloryfycacyon

Amen.
