Match me this Wedding.
OR, A health that was drunk in Sider and Perrie.
And good strong Beer to, which did make the lads merry.

To a new Court tune.
OF late there was a wedding,
kept in fair Gloucester town,
Where lads to drink their Lasses healsh,
did bravely sit them down,
And first bespake the Bridegroom,
here is a health unto my Bride,
And to all the sweet-hearts every one,
young men you have befide.
Then first spoke kind Toby,
a Welch-man I protest,
Here Is unto young Guintlin,
a Less that I love best,
There Is not her like for beauty,
search all your English shires,
And be that dares deny it,
we will have him by the ears.
With that bespake young Samuel,
pretty Bessee is my dear,
For true love and for constance,
none can my Love come near,
And therefore kind Toby,
if thou wilt maintain thy word,
Bear witness all that hears me speak,
I Will make thee eat my sword.
With that bespake honest John,
my Nan's of beauty free,
Though not so fair as others are,
yet that never troubles me,
Her love was ever constant,
and so shall mine be still,
Therefore my Nannies health I Will pledge,
with none and true good will.
Then Thomas he took up the cup,
being the fourth in place,
My turn is come quoth he to drink,
a health to my sweet Grace,
Her friends did ever love me,
as if I were their own,
Therefore my constant love to her,
for ever shall be shown.
Then William took the cup in hand,
and thus began to say,
Fair Bridget I have wooed often,
but still she says me nay.
Her friends were ever willing
that married we should be,
Therefore my Bridgets health I Will drink
in hope she will love me.
With that spoke bold Joseph,
if a man had house and land,
A Woman to consume it,
would help him out of hand,
And for to get a sweetheart,
I never took no care:
Therefore brave gallants of your healthes
I mean to drink no share.
With that spoke trusty Roger,
this man's not of my mind,
For I have sweet-hearts three or four.
of nature good and kind,
But yet my peerelasse Peggy is
a Diamond in my eye,
Therefore my Peggies health I Will drink,
and love her till I dye.
The second part To the same tune.
THen Philip took the cup in hand,
quoth he as others do,
With all my heart this health I Will drink,
unto my own sweet Sue.
For beauty and for constancy,
I know she has a share,
But for her huswifery,
my Susan shall with best compare.
Then Francis took the cup in hand,
and said, friends do you bear,
This health is to fair Maudlin,
a less that I love near,
Not London, nor fair Bristow,
nor York that merry town,
For true love and for constancy,
can put my Maudlin down.
Then Henry took the cup in hand,
and then these words be said,
Here Is a health unto my Mary,
but truth is she is no maid,
She is a widow gallants,
that has both house and land,
Bestoes a handsome woman too,
I Will have you understand.
Then Charles took up the cup,
and said these words most bold,
Here Is a health unto my Rachell.
which must not be controld,
Though Morgan said Rachell was his,
and challenged me the field,
Proud Morgan knows I bravely there
made him his sword up yield.
Then Laurence he took up the cup,
quoth he to make an end,
Here Is a health unto fair Isabell,
my constant loving friend,
Her friends and mine have talked,
and thereon are agreed.
Therefore fair Isabell I intend,
to marry with all speed.
When all this strife was ended,
I took the cup in hand,
And drink a health unto my friends,
in order as they stand,
First to my loving Host is,
that loves a pot and a toste,
And to her honest husband,
called my red nose Host.
Next health is to all Tailors,
where ever they do dwell,
That never boild their Cabage,
within a pit called hell.
A health unto the Baker,
that never was misled,
Nor yet put in the Pillorie,
for sizing of his bread.
A health unto the Widow,
that never did braule nor scold,
That has a fair young daughter,
of ninety nine years old.
A health to all good huswiues,
that never did swear nor curse,
Nor never did pick money,
out of their husbands purse.
And thus they broke up company,
all friends for ought I know,
And every one most willingly,
unto their home did go.
Had not young Samuel at first,
all ^id the Welch-mans heat,
He would have sworn them cowards all,
and said he did them beat.
