Here begins ye hystory of Tytus and Gesyppus translated out of latin in to
english by Wyllyam Walter / sometime servant to sir Henry Marney knight /
chaunceler of the duchy of Lancastre.

Tytus. Sophrone Gesyppus.


WHat time in Rome reigned Octauyan
There was a senator called Fuluius
which had a sone / a noble gentylman
Of wit excellent / whose name was Tytus
His noble virtues were hard to dyscus
Fuluius sent him / forth to his study
Unto Athenes / to learn phylozophy
This Tytus was put to be soiournynge
With one Cremes a noble man of fame
Which had a sone going to like learning
Gesyppus was this noble young man's name
And for that Tytus should go to the same
He put his sone with hy^ ^n company
To arystip to learn phylosopy
These. ij. young men led together their life
Each to other was so favorable
That never between them was any strife
That one would the other was agreeable
In learning they were equiperable
Thus they continued by years three
At their learning as brethren they had be
At which time from this world did pass cremes
Whose death these young men took right heuely
Tytus made like sorrow and heaviness
As if he where his Sone naturally
Cremes friends yt were in company
Knew not which of them for to comfort best
For with like sorrow they were both oppressed
But shortly after Cremes obscque
Gesyppus kynnesmen came incontinent
Saying if y^ he married would be
They knew a wife for him expedyent
Of beauty and substance right excellent
Of athenes borne and come of noble blood
Which unto him should be propice and good
Sophrone was the name of this damoysell
Which if he would have her in marriage
He should have her y^ does other excel
In beauty / wisdom / and eke personage
And yet she is but xv. years of age
Gesyppus of this report set on fire
With glad semblaunt granted to their desire
And on a day this damoysell to se
He took the way unto her mancyon
Tytus kept him famyliaryte
And after they had take refeccyon
Gesyppus to have co^munycacyon
Took her a part his mind for to disclose
Whereby he might know her will and purpose
As Tytus sat by and did contemplayre
Her noble beauty with the curious
Her goodly countenance and vysage fair
Her members and wisdom compendius
Of her he was so hot and amerous
His blood enchau^ed so yt with great pain
From chaungynge color he could him refrain
After Gesyppus had been there a space
They took their leave of the damsel foresaid
And went togydre home unto their place
Tytus which by love was full sore dysmayd
Upon his bed alone himself he laid
With musing he called to his remembrance
Her noble beauty in each circumstaunce
The more he did think the more was his pain
After many syghes and besy thought
Unto himself he began thus to complain
Alas pore wretch whereto am I now brought
Tytus this life that you have chosen is naught
Where is thy mind where is thy love so set
Where is thy hope thou should no wise forget
Alas Tytus thou should well consider
That she y^ thou love with heart so fre
Thou should her love as she were thy thy sister
Cremes kyndnes deserved so to be
Thou art also bounden by amyte
With Gesyppus thou art confyderate
Wherefore now you may not his honor hate
Reason would you should thy courage abate
Refrain thy self from love so fraudulent
For thy desire is full disordynate
Close thy sight and mind from this ylle intent
Knowledge thy self thy folly eke repent
Let reason now thy mind and heart excyte
To exchue thine unlawful apetyte
Upon some thing else do now thy mind set
With stand the love yt does the so assail
Thou have good cause this love for to forget
The deed were shame thy purpose is but frail
With honor thou may not therewith prevail
Love and kyndnes should cause the fle therfro
If thou consider what thou ought to do
If thou should break thy love and amyte
And to Gesyppus commit so great shame
What should happen of thyn ennormyte
Every man of untruth would the blame
Thereby thou should lose honor and good name
And where thou were named a friend steadfast
As false and untrue you should be outcast
But when her beauty he did remember
From his counsel he did this wise replye
The law of love of might is more strenger
Than any law the truth to verifye
To gods and man's it does replye
Amyte is often lost by vyolence
Among many to Err is small offense
The father has by love condiscended
And with his daughter done his foul pleasure
Brother with sister eke have offended
Which is great offense and displeasure
Than from his friend his wife for to procure
Wherefore none can one of this deed reprove
Sith I am compelled by veruent love
My youth and courage my deed shall excuse
Love to this purpose does me sore compel
This vyrgyn does my heart such wise abuse
In bewty and wisdom which does excel
That love and reason together rebel
So that to love her I can not refrain
Whom each man desires for to obtain
But fortune here I hauecause for to ban
Which to my friend Gesyppus has her lent
Rather than unto some other strange man
From him to take her I can not assent
From an other I might conuenyent
Alas this chance does encomber me so
That I can not tell what is best to do
In this wise Tytus woefully did plain
Of his purpose being varyable
That day nor night he could himself refrain
From syghes and weeping lamentable
Mete nor sleep was to him agreeable
He was so low brought by this heaviness
That from his bed he could not him redress
Gesyppus which saw him so impotent
The sodayn chance he gretely did bewail
And from his friend Tytus he seldom went
But often asked of him in counsel
What thing might best for his soro we prevail
And where the sykenes did his body grieve
Promising him he would his pain releue
Tytus made unto him feigned excuse
Not she wynge him the cause of his greuaunce
But Gesyppus his saying did refuse
That need he must declare his woeful chance
Wherefore to him with deedly countenance
With great syghes and teres distillynge
He showed him it in manner following
My friend if it pleased god Immortal
Death more than life to me were far better
For fortune has made me so bond and thrall
That I am like from virtue dyffeuer
Wherefore an honest death I had lever
Than for to live and be in worldly shame
Whereby I might empayre and lose my name
To tell the the chance I am right shamfast
But for I ought not dyssemble with the
To tell the truth I shall not be aghast
The cause of my grefe and ennormyte
Love beauty shame and also honest
Contend and strive which shall have maystry
That I know not whereto I may apply
Unto him orderly he did declare
How of Sophrone the excellent noblesse
Was the chief cause of his sorrow and care
And how her love his heart did so oppress
That of conforte he was remedylesse
And how by love he intended to dye
For without shame he knew no remedy
Gesyppus of this was astonyed
As he y^ loved her with all his heart
And to him self this wise he replied
Better it were from her for to depart
Rather than Tytus by the cruel darte
Of love should thus fynysshe his woeful life
A friend to find is harder than a wife
By Tytus te^es to pity meued
Was Gesyppus which wept for company
And in this (...) Tytus be repreued
Me thinks ye be not to me friendly
In keeping your sorrow so secretly
Ye should to me sooner your mind dysclose
What had been your desire will and purpose
Though ye thought the deed to be dishonest
Yet to your friend ye should it dyscouer
As well the ill as good he will degest
If he be a steadfast friend and lover
Your health and mind he will gladly further
And if you need give you his best counsel
What thing therein might to you most avail
If ye love Sophrone. I do not meruell
For knowing her beauty and noblenes
Her virtue wysoome which does so excel
Would move thy mind of very gentylnes
To love a maid of so great worthynes
For the greter a thing is of valor
The more a noble heart it does procure
But where ye do now on fortune complain
Which has Sophrone put in my governance
Me think thereof ye should be glad and feign
For what man would thy desire more auaunce
Than his pleasure and namely in such chance
But always I have couerted thy health
More than mine own or any singular welthe
And if the matter stood in such a case
That I might not refuse it honestly
Ye had I rather mine honor dyffare
Than by her cruel love y^ ye should dye
But she is yet in such estate truly
That ye may have her for to be your wife
Which I shall do for saving of your life
Ye had good cause to dyspryse my frendshyp
If in this case I left you destitute
He is no friend yt kyndnes will let slyp
With honor when he may it execute
How should ye me for your friend now repute
If I would not in this extremyte
As a steadfast friend show you amyte
Sophrone I have loved with tender heart
Desiring the day of our marriage
But my love is not so veruent and smarte
But yt I shall my self therfro aswage
Ye love her with a more better courage
Wherefore be glad of her ye shall not fail
In my chamber shall be your espousayle
Wherefore put from your mind this thought and care
Leave of your heaviness lamentable
Restore your self to your former welfare
Ye have good cause to be confortable
Apply your self to be strong and able
That ye may the fruit of your love attain
Which for to have ye do so much complain
Tytus with this was gretely conforted
Yet of his profer he had great marvel
To se his kyndnes so soon exorted
To his desire voluptuous and frail
Gesyppus love which so much did prevail
Made him have shame of his great vsurpinge
Wherefore he spoke thus with teeres weeping
Gesyppus thy great liberalyte
Is openly to me now manifest
Which on my part should be showed to the
But I shall not obey to thy request
To take thy wife the deed were dishonest
Wherefore enjoy y^ fortune has the lent
My hard chance to suffer I am content
Of thy good fortune use the chance and lote
And suffer me in sorrow to abide
And in salt teres my body to rote
For hard fortune for me does so provide
And cruel love to death shall be my gyde
Which by desire me daily does so grieve
That my wretched life it shall me bereue
Tytus if amyte may now purchase
That to my desire ye will you assent
I shall find the mean within a short space
That ye shall have your purpose and intent
For ye know well that love is so veruent
That many have lost their life by y^ pain
Of their purpose when they might not attain
The grefe ye suffer is importunate
That ye can not therewith long continue
And if ye should by such mortal ^ate
Than by like chance I should after ensue
If amyte my mind could not subdue
Yet do I covet your life for to have
Whereby I might mine own purchase and sau^
Therefore Sophrone unto you shall abide
Which is so excellent a creature
That ye can not such another provide
That should be so much unto your plasure
My veruent love I shall right well endure
To love some other I shall me apply
Both our minds I may so satysfye
Tho such a wife be hard for me to find
yet a sure friend is harder to purchase
Wherefore to leave her reason does me bind
Than I should lose my friend by her trespace
A wife I may me get in like space
But hard it is to find a friend steadfast
A thousand year if yt my life should last
yet do I not my wife in this case lose
Sith y^ unto my friend she shall remain
But of. ij. ylles the lest I do chese
Wherefore if my prayer may ought obtain
From so great sorrow do your self refrain
Unto your former state your self restore
That ye may have yt ye desire so sore
Tytus of this was conforted gretely
And to Gesyppus in this wise he spoke
I am in doubt where I may apply
And if I should your profre now forsake
Whom ye defyre so specially to take
But for your kyndenes does my shame expel
I shall apply to your desire and will
God grant y^ I may be so fortunate
You to auaunce with honor and riches
Or to increase your degree and estate
Whereby I might my faythfulnes express
And deserve your benyuolent kyndnes
That ye may know how much acceptable
Your mercy is to me agreeable
Gesyppus said I hold this counsel best
For asmoche as I have made a promise
I must follow and color my behest
For if y^ I should Sophrone now despise
Murmur among our friends soon would rise
That to an other they would her mary
And so we both should lose her wylfully
Wherefore I think it best in my demynge
That Sophrone as my wife y^ I shall wedde
And hither to my house her for to bring
And after that she is brought unto by bed
To her instede of me ye shall be led
Where as ye may accomplysshe your pleasure
As man and wife by law and eke nature
And when this chance is plainly manifest
If her friends there with will be content
Than is the matter in good case and rest
And if they will not thereunto assent
yet at the lest ye shall have your intent
The deed so done amended can not be
Wherefore need shall cause them with you agree
How Gesyppus went out of his chamber to
Tytus and how Tytus lay with Sophrone.

This marriage in that time was used
That after the tryumphe of the wedding
The spouse and bryde should be brought unto bed
Where each unto other should give a ring
And if they made thereat no refusing
Than during life they do each other take
And else they may promise than forsake
Tytus allowed the foresaid counsel
Gesyppus Sophrone as his wife did wedde
And in his house was made their espousayle
When Tytus had his health recovered
At night the wives brought the bryde to bed
And Gesyppus as custom was truly
Went to the chamber with her to lie
Gesyppus chamber where as the bryde lay
Tytus chamber annexed was unto
Which had a little door and secret way
From the one to the other for to go
Gesyppus the candell light quenched tho
And to Tytus chamber fast he hastyd
And with his wife to ly he did him bydde
Tytus for shame at the first did deny
But Gesyppus of word and deed steadfast
Unto his saying did such wise reply
That to lie with her he granted at last
To Sophrons bed he ascended in have
And asked in familiaryte
His wife for ever if yt she would be
Sophrone wiche knew nothing of this matter
Thought it was Gesyppus y^ to her spoke
Wherefore unto him she made this answer
For her husbonde she would him not forsake
Tytus his wedynge ring forth than did take
And put it on the finger of his wife
Granting to be her husbonde term of life
Of venus they used the sport and play
As pastyme is of lovers amerus
This custom they used many a day
yet in y^ time she could never distus
That her husbonde she lay with was Tytus
But this could not be hid so pryuely
But at length it must be known openly
In the mean time from Rome were sent lettres
How his father his mortal life had past
Wherefore he must his substance to possess
Resort thither in all possible have
Which tidings made Tytus full sore aghast
He coveting Sophrone with him to go
With Gesyppus counseyle what to do
This thing they could not do co^nuenyent
Without Sophrone had thereof knowledgynge
Wherefore to show her both they did assent
And in a secret chamber they her bring
As ye have herd told her of each thing
Which for sorowre wept in great abundance
Reprouynge Gesyppus of this false chance
Without declarynge her mind and purpose
Unto her fathers house she resorted
And unto him the chance she did disclose
How by Gesyppus she was deceived
And y^ she was not as they supposed
The wife of Gesyppus but contrary
By covert mean Tytus did her mary
This thing her father and friends did grieve
And to Gesyppus kynne they did complain
So y^ they together did him repreue
And for the deed they did him ill dysdayne
Saying he deserved for his false train
In deep prison to suffer punysshement
And that this deed he should right sore repent
Gesyppus to their saying did reply
Affyrmynge the deed to be commendable
And that he deserved to have truly
Of them love and thank Inestymable
Which had her wedded to one more able
In riches honor blood and dygnyte
Whereby she and hers auaunced should be
Tytus having knowledge of this barate
In his mind he was greatly troubled
Knowing the greeks manner and and estate
With words and thretenynges to fight and chyde
Till they mete one that dare them well abide
Than are they of their words pacyent
Their simple manner is so Innocent
He knowing their custom varyable
To cause them to leave their malice and hate
With a romans heart he did him able
In actual sapyence decorate
Both their friends he did there congregate
Gesyppus being with him in presence
This wise he rebuked their necligence
The phylozophers have determined
The acts of every man mortal
By the gods should be predestined
Before their birth to be their chance fatal
Therefore what fortune unto us do fall
We can not though we would thereto reply
Sith yt it is given us by destyny
We ought also faithfully to believe
That the gods have such preemynence
Our fortune at their pleasure for to give
And yt is iuged by their sentence
Can not be broken by our violence
Wherefore he is a fool yt will despise
The works done by the gods advise
To my purpose I have knowledge truly
That Gesyppus ye have ill reproved
For that Sophrone to me he did mary
But if reason your minds had moved
The deed so done ye should have approved
Sithe yt the gods did it so ordain
Not to him but to me she should remain
But for yt some this reason do despyce
That fortune is by deuyne prouydence
Which thing to man should be great preiudyce
I will now treat of an other sentence
Two things I am bound by vyolence
Which to my noblenes is contrary
But I am compelled for to vary
One is my self of honor to auaunce
The other to dysprayse mine enymy
Which I shall do with good remembrance
As the matter does now require Justly
From the troth of it I will not reply
But with circumspect delyberacyon
Of my purpose I shall make relacyon
Your words are grounded more of malice
Than of any Just title or reason
Which do Gesyppus shamefully dyspyce
For y^ he has great kyndnes to me done
Of two things has the best choson
My life to save rather than to fulfill
His own pleasure or your purpose and will
We are confederate in amyte
Wherefore the law of love does him thus bind
To help his friend in his extremyte
Therefore to prove himself steadfast and kind
He showed love contrary to your mind
Which thing to him is more commendable
Than to follow your mind unreasonable
To one of athenes ye her married
And he has given her unto a Romayne
Athenes to rome may not be compared
Of all the world which y^ is sovereign
In which I was mine honor to sustain
Borne as a cytezyn therein to dwell
In manhood and leruynge which does excel
Ye be bond and thrall but I am borne fre
For unto Rome ye be bond and subject
Because I am scoler in this cite
As come of vile blood ye do me suspecte
I will ye know yt I am not abiecte
My places at rome declare my lynage
Portured with mine ancestors image
With tyles of Tryumphe the gate is set
Which mine ancestors by their worthynes
Within the capytoll long time did get
Which at this day does more and more encrase
I am a shamed to boost my riches
And possessyon which are so importune
As I were the friendly child of fortune
What cause have ye Gesyppus to reprove
That has wedded Sophrone to such estate
At Rome I may do much to your behoue
For the common wealth publyke and private
If ye be wise ye be right fortunate
Gesyppus does your blod to honor raise
Wherefore ye have cause him to love and praise
Some may fortune do not so much dysdayne
That Sophrone is given me in espousynge
But for yt I did get her by a train
Her friends thereunto not consenting
Tho y^ I did covertly do this thing
Like a lechour I have not her forlayne
Whereby I should her and her blood dystayne
Her fair beauty enflamed my courage
That in her love my heart was set on fire
I durst not atempte her in matyage
Nor of your consent therein to require
For I should not obtain of my defyre
Sith with me to rome y^ I should her take
Whose company ye ar loathe to forsake
Therefore I have done this thing covertly
To you my mind I durst not manifest
Gesyppus in my name her to mary
To color my purpose I thought it best
Which did it according to my request
As a concubyn^ I did not her use
But for my lawful wife I did her choose
From Rome there is tidings unto me sent
That my father has left his mortal life
Wherefore as reason would I did assent
Her to lead with me as my lawful wife
And for I must be from you fugetyue
Therefore the matter I do many fest
Requyrynge you it frendely to dysgest
If your affynyte I did dispyce
Sophrone with you if I would I might leave
And as deluded I may her remyse
Which should your hertes more anger and grieve
But god dyffende y^ ye should me repreue
Of such a shame I being a Romayne
Or that my friends by it should dystayne
Wherefore as a friend I do you require
Your malice y^ ye remember no more
But as friends apply to my desire
Sophrone my wife unto me to restore
With kyndnes I will acquyte you therefore
For whether the deed done be good or ill
It to amend ye can not though ye will
And if my request ye do now despise
Gesyppus with me unto Rome shall go
With armed power I shall ageyn you rise
Sophrone with strong hand for to take you fro
By fell battle I shall entreat you so
That ye shall know what Indignacyon
Romans will take for your transgressyon
These words said he arose from his place
And Gesyppus by the hand he did take
Knyttynge his brows and frowning with his face
His heed for anger at them he did shake
Such countenance unto them he did make
As he did despise all them utterly
And as he would take vengeance cruelly
They by these words part for love did gre
And part for fere of his great manasynge
With him to have love and affynyte
They thought it best for to be assenting
Since y^ Gesyppus had made refusing
Tytus affynyte not to forsake
Whereby they should them both their enmys make
Wherefore all they after Tytus tho went
Saying thy would not his wife him witholde
His frendeshyp to have they were all content
Gesyppus their talent forgive they would
And in their arms they him claspe and fold
With loving manner as friends should do
Each from other departed home to go
Sophrone unto Tytus they sent again
Which like a noble lady and prudent
From Gesyppus her love she did refrain
And to Tytus her heart she did assent
And with him to Rome as his wife she went
Where of Tytus friends and famyly
She was received right honorably
Gesyppus at athenes still did remain
Which for he showed to Tytus amyte
Of all the people was in great dysdayne
And by cruyle dyscorde and enmyte
He was brought in to such calamyte
They him exiled desolate and poor
Within athenes never to come more
He ledynge his life in great pouerte
Unto Rome he took his passage and way
To pray Tytus of his benygnyte
Him for to help in his needful afray
Unto his place he came upon a day
Before the gate Tytus he began abide
As he came in of him to be espide
Tytus from the market came at the last
In to his house he went incontinent
Gesyppus was so heavy and shamefast
That to Tytus he would him not present
That he should first know him was his intent
Which knew him not he was so ill arayd
Wherefore he past by and to him naught said
Gesyppus which wrongfully supposed
That Tytus did forsake his acquayntaunce
Because y^ he was so poorly clothed
His great kyndenes calling to remembrance
To Tytus showed in his most needful channce
Part for sorrow and part eke for dysdayne
He went from thens and woefully began plain
Till it was night about he wandered
Mete he would ete but money had he none
With thought and care he was so com bered
That for his death he made rufully moan
And as he was thus walking all alone
Within the cite he came at the last
Unto a place which was forgrowen and wast
How Gesyppus lyenge a sleep / two thieves came and the stronger slew the
weyker in deuydynge of their pray.



Aderke cave by chance he there soon had found
In to the which he did dyscende and crepe
And laid him prostrate there upon y^ ground
Provoking himself for to fall a sleep
His hard fortune he did complain and weep
With heaviness he was so sore oppressed
That at the last he fell unto his rest
The same time to the cave there came by chance
Two thieves which had stolen a pray y^ night
Between them two there fell great varyaunce
For their boty was not departed right
First they do chyde and after y^ they fight
The strenger thief the weyker in y^ str^fe
Overcame and bereued him his life
Gesyppus seeing this was glad and feign
Knowing this way his death for to purchase
Should be better than he himself certain
His dispared life by wepen difface
All night he tarried in the same place
Till the pretors men in the morning tide
Took him as gylty of the homycyde
Bounden of them like a these brought he was
Before the praetor Uarro by his name
Which asked him if he the said trespace
Had committed by his importune blame
Gesyppus as gylty granted the same
Wherefore the praetor as the law had set
Bad he should be hang on the gybet
By fortune at the time of this judgment
Tytus came in to the said pretory
Of Gesyppus face taking aduysement
Merueyled gretely of his penury
To save his life knowing no remedy
Before the praetor sorrowful dismayed
In this manner unto him thus he said
Uarro command this man Unfortunate
To be called again whom y^ foriuged
He is gyltles for I by cruel fate
This homycyde my self have committed
Whom thy men found this morning strangled
By which offense the gods Immortal
I have offended and the law with all
Wherefore (...) (...) heart can not assent
Unt^ (...) such I^^ury
To suff^e this man (...) innocent
For my trespace thus wrongefully to die
Uarro of this was marvelous sorry
That Tytus (...) audience this wise spoke
Which confession he might not forsake
Wherefore to save his honor and nobles
According as the law him commanded
Gesyppus was re^^ked than doubtless
And in this wise varro him repreued
What folysshe madness has thy mind m^ued
To grant the (...) without any ^^^ment
Whereof thou art gyltles and Innocent
Sith yt the (...) (...) death certain
Why did you the said (...) (...)de confess
Thou being not compelled by no pain
Behold Tytus which (...) does express
That of this homycyde (...) gyltles
And yt he himself the deed did commyt
Wherefore the (...) (...) has the now quyt
Gesyppus beheld Tytus woefully
Knowing he did it his life to purchase
Unto the Juge this wise he did reply
For pity teres rennynge (...) his face
Uarro he said my (...) (...) (...)
Tytus has now showed his pity to late
To me that am a man Unfortunate
Tytus contrary said praetor take heed
This man Juged is a stranger doubtless
Thou may perceive yt he did not the deed
By the deed man he was take wepenles
He would feign dye he is in such dystresse
Wherefore as unguilty let him now go
And me the trespassoure to death for to do
The praetor meruayled of their constaunce
His mind perceived they were not gylty
Wherefore of them to make delyueraunce
To save them both his mind he did apply
And as he was casting for remedy
There came a young man named publius
Of life and deed which was susspecius
This publius which the murdre had done
Knowing them both for to be Innocent
He was moved with such contricyon
To dye for his trespare he did assent
Before the praetor he did him present
And wylfully without any asking
He told the deed in manner following
Praetor my great (...) does me compel
Plainly to discuss this altercacyon
What god does move my mind I cannot tell
Of mine offense to make the relacyon
My heart is taken with compun^cyon
To se them offer them self for to dye
Of this trespate they being not gyltye
Truly my self before the morning tide
Slew this man which was my companyon
This unfortunate slepynge there beside
Of our boty making particyon
We fell together at discencyon
As most strengest in y^ debate and strife
From my fellow I took the mortal life
For to excuse Tytus it shall not need
For his noble fame and great worthynes
Do show yt he would not do such a deed
Wherefore praetor of this my wretchydnes
Do quyte them both as men yt be gyltles
And to me which slew this man my felawe
Do Justyce according unto the law
Octauyan had knowledge of this chance
The parties before him examyned
Knowing the matter in (...) circumstaunce
The two unguilty he there pardoned
And also the thief which was foruiged
For the love of Tytus he did forgive
His trespace and in liberte to live
After Tytus had rebuked frendely
Gesyppus of mystrust and ferefulnes
He clasped him in arms louyngly
Unto his house with him he went doubtless
Sophrone Tytus wife wept for heaviness
To se Gesyppus in such pouerte
Complaining fortunes mutabylyte
She received him as her own brother
Reteynynge him well and honorably
Tytus likewise as a friendly lover
Apparelyd him in clothing rychely
With y^ he was fed right delycatly
That in short time he was brought in such plyght
That he recovered both his health and might
Tytus his substance euenly divided
And to Gesyppus in matrymony
With his sister fuluia so named
A noble vyrgyn he gave it freely
This kyndnes for kyndnes he did truly
And Gesyppus secret Tytus began take
And unto him in this wise he tho spoke
Friend and brother of two things now choose
For they shall be at your arbytrement
Which for to take and which for to refuse
The one is whyther ye can be content
Here to abide or y^ ye will assent
Unto athenes to go with this substance
Which I have given to you in governance
Gesyppus in his mind considering
His unkind exile and great Indygence
With drew his mind from athenes retournynge
And perceiving Tytus benyuolence
Said unto him his mind was and sentence
if his will were there to abide certain
Desiring to be made a free Romayne
In one house they led together their life
Tytus and Sophrone in prosperyte
Gesyppus and fuluia eke his wife
Abiding with them in tranquylite
Daily with them encreasynge amyte
Till cruel death with his furyous darte
Their mortal life from this world did depart
Lenuoy du translateur.
AMyte is for to be commended
As the true mother to magnyfycence
Of whom all honest is dyscended
Germayne to charity and benificence
Enymy to auaryce and violence
Flaterynge and praysynge it does also fle
Such is the kind of parfyte amyte
Ready to help in each extremyte
Her neighbor by kyndnes favorable
As if she were in such necessyte
They should to her be like agreeable
To stedfastnes always conformable
With each man having love and unity
Such is the kind of parfyte amyte
What riches frendshyp or affynyte
Might do so much as Tytus heaviness
To move Gesyppus heart to such pity
To give his wife of so great worthynes
Whom he loved more than any riches
Unto Tytus in his aduersyte
Him to releue but only amyte
What thing Gesyppus courage did thus move
Sophrons / and his friends great manasynge
The peoples rumor which did him remove
Their scornynge and their unkind exilynge
To set at naught for to be maynteynynge
Tytus quarrel in each manner degree
But only love and parfyte amyte
What thing did thus move Tytus consequent
To offer him self ready for to dye
Affyrmynge Gesyppus as Innocent
Of the murdre and himself as gylty
His acquayntaunce dissemblyge there friendly
As he knew not what man y^ he should be
But only love and parfyte amyte
What thing did move Tytus heart and courage
To give Gesyppus in his most needful chance
His sister fuluia in marriage
With half his patrimony and substance
Him in honor and riches to auaunce
Whom fortune brought in extreme pouerte
But only love and parfyte amyte
But now a days amyte does decay
Each man couetyth his synguler profet
Upon perils they do forecast always
That by a friend they do but little set
All their delight is riches for to get
Ingratitude woe worth unto the
Which do exclude both love and amyte
Finis.
