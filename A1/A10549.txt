Friendly Counsel. OR, Here Is an answer to all Demanders
The which I Will declare to all Bystanders,
Thereby to teach them how to know
A perfect Friend from a flattering Foe.

To the tune of I could fancy pretty Nancy.


IT was my chance not long time since,
To be where was much conference:
And amongst their questions all,
One did me to answer call,
Thus demanding how to know
A faithful friend from a flattering foe.
Being much amaz^ed in my mind,
How this Theme might be defind;
Yet I answered thus again,
That I would resolve them plain,
In what kind they well might know
A faithful friend from a flattering foe.
If that thou have a friend, be kind,
Here in true love thou son may find,
He Will not leave thee in dis^resse,
But will help thee more or less:
Hereby you may plainly know
A faithful, etc.
On the contrary, mark my words,
Flattering tongues are worse than swords,
They Will speak you fair while you them feed,
But quite forsake thee in thy need:
These are perfect signs to know
A faithful, etc.
If thou want means and have a friend,
He Will something give and something lend,
He will not see thee for to perish,
But will thee relieve end cherish:
Hereby you may find and know
A faithful, etc.
The Flatterer whilst thou have think,
Will proffer meat and give thee drink,
But for it thou shall dearly pay,
For he will bring thee to decay:
Then I advise thee how to know
A faithful, etc.
Thy friend will grieve to see thee lack,
Hee'ls speak thee fair behind thy back,
In words and deeds he will still agree,
He Will grieve to see thy misery:
Hereby you may plainly know
A faithful, etc.
Thy foe indeed is nothing so,
For he will rejoice still at thy woe,
And if thou once grow poor and bare,
Then for thee he no more will care:
Thus thou plainly here may know
A faithful, etc.
Thy friend will wish thee keep thy means,
And not to waste it on lewd Queens,
He Will bid thee for to have a care
Cards, Dice and Whores, are dangerous ware:
Hereby you may plainly know
A faithful, etc.
The other he will thee entice
To drunkenness, Cards, Whores and Dice,
He Will advise thee for to roar,
To spend thy means and so be poor:
Thus thou here may plainly know
A faithful, etc.
The Second Part. To the same tune,


THy ^riend such lewdness soon will check,
And tell thee thou art like to lack,
He Will bi^ thee always have a care
Of that which thou do little fear,
And that is, poverty will grow,
Which thy true friend would not have so.
The false and fained Flatterer
Will seek to trap thee in his snare,
His words most sweet shall still appear
To get thy money, wine and beer:
These are certain signs to know
A faithful friend from a flattering foe.
If that thy friend be true indeed,
He Will not forsake thee in thy need,
He Will take thy part in weal and woe,
Thy flattering friend will not do so:
These are certain signs to know
A faithful, etc.
Now some perchance may this object,
And say they are of the true Sect,
But such I Will never trust till I
Their inward thoughts do prove and try,
Then I certain am to know
A faithful, etc.
If that you want, then needs of force,
For your relief you will take some course,
Need stands behind and bids you go,
The kindness of men's hearts to know,
And where once you have tried it so,
You Will know your friend, etc.
Thy friend will wondrous sorry be
To see thee fall to misery,
And to his power he will give relief
To ease thy dolor, woe and grief:
These are certain signs to know
A faithful, etc.
Your fair tongued fawning hypocrite
Will say that you were void of wit,
To spend your means so foolishly,
And lack so long before you dye.
These are certain signs to know
A faithful, etc.
Then this advice take then of me,
Before need comes go thou and see.
Try whilst thou have of thine own,
And see where favor may be shown:
Then thou soon shall find and know
A faithful, etc.
And look where thou did favor find,
There be not wavering like the wind,
If that thy friend prove just and true,
Then do not change him for a new:
Thus to all men I do show
The difference twix a friend and foe.
For my part I may plainly say,
That friends are apt for to decay,
In wealth a man shall have great store,
But very few if once grown poor:
This I write for men to know
A faithful, etc.
When I had means then I had friends,
But now I want, their friendship ends,
Now but few will take my part,
Nor help release me of my smart:
This I have writ for men to know
A faithful, etc.
Thus to conclude and end my Song,
Let me advise both old and young,
If thou do wish for many friends,
Then have a care and get some means
Then you need not care to know
A faithful friend from a flattering foe.
