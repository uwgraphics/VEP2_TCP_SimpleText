A SPIRITVAL SONG OF Thanksgiving unto GOD, for his grace and power. Written
by a close prisonner (with a coal) for his own comfort.
LET others singe of this and that,
I will singe to thy praise,
Who do out of adversity,
Deliver me always:
And ^^^^'st to me that Comforter,
In all my sore temptation:
Who does refreshe my sinful soul
With spiritual consolation:
And graunt'st to me such patience,
For all my foes despite,
As I to wait upon thy will,
Do inwardly delight.
And when I see my nature strive
Against thy just correction,
Then do I pray thy Majesty
To help mine vnsubiection.
And when my troubles most increase,
(As who lives well and smarts not)
Then comes my Savior next to me,
And sticks by me and startes not:
And when I feel my flesh to shrink
Under thy heavy hand*
I am constrained my ^^^^chednes,
Better to vndersta^^^
Calling to mind those grievous sins,
I thought not on before,
Lamenting them and purposing
To do the like no more:
But their contrary virtues all,
Eft soon to put in ure
From grace to grace, from strength to strength,
Whyl'st my days shall endure:
By thy free grace and perfect strength,
Whereof alone I boast,
For if I should do otherwise,
My labor were but lost:
Since all good gifts do come from thee,
And thou will suffer none
To rob thee of that praise which does
Belong to thee alone:
Yet whyl'st by wrestling against sin,
Reward for to obtain,
I seek by deserte of my works,
Thou aunswer'st thus again.
The answer.
WHereas thy sins do far exceed,
My grace does more abound,
And in thy weakness most of all,
My power is tried and found:
My grace in Christ sufficient is,
And all my works does pass:
By it I am more glorified,
Then ought that ever was:
And as J made all things of naught,
And darkness to be light,
So make I naught for to be good,
And seeble to be might:
All persons and all things on earth
I have shutt under sin,
That by my pardon, general,
I might all glory win.
I am the first, the midst, and last,
And I am all in all,
That all at all times should on me
For help and mercy call.
My grace is sure full free and pure.
Or else it were no grace,
It can not stand at any hand,
Where works have any place:
My power infailleable and most incomparable
Is of no force in deed,
When it is made of others ayde^,
To stand in any need:
Therefore I call the worst of all,
And leave the righteous still.
That all may see my grace to be
According to my will:
Therefore I bring both Clown and King
To dust, to death, to naught:
That every wight should know my might,
All things alone has wrought:
Wherefore be still and flee from ill,
And do well, but confess
My guiftes in thee both lent to be,
And marred more or less:
That still my grace may serve in place
All thy defaultes to mende,
And that my power may every hour
Uphold thee to the end,
When there shall be no sin in thee,
Weakness nor want at all,
But grace* might, wealth, peace, joy, right,
Health and glory eternal.
THus do thou Lord direct my soul
To quiet peace and rest,
Whereby I am assured all
Shall fall out to the best:
And that no shame can me defame,
For why thou art my praise,
In life and death and all in all,
To me at all assaies,
For thy great mercies sake in Christ,
In whom thou art well pleased,
That heavy hearted sinners of
Their burdens should be eased,
And made partakers of those joys
Unspeakable and rife,
Which thou do keep in store for them,
After this woeful life:
And in mean while the holy ghost
Does keep them safe and sound:
No rage nor no resistance can,
Their happy state confound.
Now whilst mine enemies seek to drive
Me into desperation,
Thou forcest them against their wills
To further my salvation:
And thou do turn all wiles and wrongs
Unto their own disgrace:
Who seek by all extremities,
Thy servants to deface.
And thou do turn all other things
To my behoof likewise,
So that to better mine estate,
My heart can not devise.
How ever wretched worldlings deem,
I am quite cast away*
And mine old friends a loofe from me
Do stand as at a baye:
Yet thou do stand at my right hand,
And compass me about,
And furnishe me with diverse gifts,
To make me strong and stout:
And outward gifts sufficient,
And meet for me and mine,
To serve thy grace, and show thy power
By providence divine:
Beyond reason without desert,
Better then many more
Of thy dear Saints who are content,
And singe for joy also:
Lord grant we pray that so we may,
Since thou art strong and kind,
(As in our conscience and experience
We every day do find)
That by things all which do befall,
We may draw near to thee,
Till thy sweet face in heavenly place,
For ever we shall see.
AMEN.
M.D. XCII.
