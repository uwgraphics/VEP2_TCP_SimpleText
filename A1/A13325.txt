A Table showing the true value of the Hundred, and the half Quartern of
Haperdepois weight: at any price whatsoever, this being observed, that if the
price of the Hundred weight be not expressed in any one sum, then to add such
two sums together as will make the even price thereof, or else such two
sums as come nearest to it. As for example, if you would know at 1 pound 16
shillings the Hundred weight, what cost the pound? look in the Table for 1
pound 15 shillings (which is the nearest to it) whereunto add the first sum
in the Table, which is 1 shilling 2 pence, and it will appear that 1 pound 16
shillings the hundred weight, will cost 3 pence 3 farthings half farthing the
pound wanting 2 pence in the hundred weight. The like may speedily be done
after this manner for any other price.
