the Lord he would spare his people / which he had redeemed with te blood of his

upon us / according to our deseruinges: Afterward I did begin to consider
in my mind one thing of an other / by what means we might resyste these

Turks / yet never the less the same consultation seems unto me to be so

NOw my oration and purpose makes haste unto the false and Antichriste^ shadow
of religion / for why? as there is one god / one wisdom / one truth and one
goodness / eue^ so likewise there is but one only true religion / that is to
say the Christen: Nevertheless through the craft of the devil and the
folysshenes of Diversity of religion is the cause of great strife.

but contrarywyse being appayred or made weak / it can not be but the blissed
name of god must needs be derkened and men wrapped about with innumerable

wit / and proves all the ways to the wood to corrupt religion / and being
corrupted by his suggestio^ and the feigned Imagynatyon of men (which without
any respect to the word of god do make them an ydole in their heart and give
th(...) unto pleasante or acceptable worship after their own affections) to
restrain / suppress and keep it under. For that I may passover with silence
and set a side the superstitions of the heithe^: How often did the Israelytes
being under the administration of the Judges and kings depart away from the
religion deeliuered them of god and confirmed with wonderful works? What
monsterous worshippings of Cy^. x^^. Iere. ^ij.
god did they receive which truly didnot abstain from the slaughter of their
own children and to offer them unto ydolles? yea truly the princes them selffe
and the heads of religion and all the people (a few being except) did
co^spyre to gyther in to Iere. ^.
strange rites and customs of worshippinge false gods / and that the
prophets should prophecye a lie / and the prestes should clapps with their
hands / and rejoice thereat / and all the people should be well pleased and have
great pleasure and delectation in thee things. Therefore were not godly me^ so
greatly obeyed which went about to call them back again into the way of
health and to renew or restore relygio^ being lost: but they were taken for
seditious and wicked persons and for men stark mad and outof their wits
until soche time as the people being plaged withsome great calamyte were
brought back again by the scourges and whippes of the lord from their false
gods and dumme ydolls unto the true god which lives for ever and did change
their wickedness with godlynes / theyer mischeffe with virtue / theyer ignorance
with knowledge. etc. How many heresies did invade the church of Christ with in
a few years after the lords ascensio^ unto the heavens? And yet for There is
no heresye but it seduceth some men.
all that there was no heresy that ever came abroad and brought forth it
selffe so weak and unreasonable which did not draw away part of the
churchis flock far of from the truth / so that they could scantly be brought
again into the way of health with the great labor of those men which in
learning and living were men Apostolyke and most holy messengers sent from
the lord. What is more abhorringe not only from the holy scriptures but also
from all good reason then the doctrine of the heretyke called The heretyke

Manicheus which did knowledge one-while some infernal furye / an other while

taught that there was an other God of the old people before the incarnation of
our lord / and an other of the Christianes synse he was / incarnate and in
holy things he mixed soche abominations as is not to be spoken. But what
busynes / what vexation / what troble did he make unto the church which
certain years did houlde Aurelius Augustinus wrapped and tayed as it were in a

nature / by whose power cheffely the world is gouuerned and to whom they
study to do acceptable seruyse and to pacifye the dyspleasure of the godhed

why god loves all men with out the respect of persons and is indifferent to
them all / willinge them all to come to the knowledge of his truth and to
receive health / and for that cause does he grant in the respect of Christ
his son by the same Christ his wisdom and virtue the use of a thing most

wisdom in the breasts of men / which in some of them by the same grace of god

negligence and wild bringing up / partly through the fraud and craft of the
devil / and partly by the false persuasions of men they are either utterly
destroyed or else being corrupted they do degenerate and fall out of kind
into some superstitio^^ For why where the mind is ones turned away from the
right way and the lygh^ of Gods word / it must needs wande^ in derknes and
errors. And some certain true vndersta^dynges or knowledge of the nature of God

God / and do certain things right and honest and acceptable to God: and
partelye being tayed in the net of false opynyons they cleue unto lies / and
commytte and do things contrary to the will and pleasure of God. wherefore as
we ought not to allow all the deeds and sayings of those men / which do
profess the Christen relygyon / seeing that it is manyfeste they be often
times taken in errors and fautes: even so is it not convenient to condemn all
the ordynaunces and laws and deeds of them which dyffer from the Christen
relygyon / yea even in very many and the chief doctrynes and artycles: for
why the Prophets and Apostles and the only author of our health does show

be tried by the rule and squyre of Gods word. And then at the last let that
thing be houlden which is koowen and proved to be good and true. Nether seems

is agreeable to the saying of the Apostle Peter in the tenth chapter of the
acts. I parceyue for a truth that there is no respect of persons with God.
But in all people he that fears him and works ryghteousnes is accepted with
him. Forthermore that we may make haste unto owre pretended purposes I seem

Therefore these things being laid as the foundations which hither to we have
spoken generally of the Christen and Antichristen religion: we do turn our
style unto the religion of Mahumet / which the nation of the Turks has
obstinately holden these seven hondre the years and more. And de yet still
defend and labor as much as they can with most cruel wars to amplify the
same / for the prescription and manner of worship pynge God / and to obtain
blessed lyffe by the title of Mahumet the most excellent The law of Mahumet
what it is / and what it co^tayneth.
Prophet has certain things very well known / to be folyshe and dyshoneste /
which so greatly do not taste or savor of the celestyall fountain / that they
also differ far and wide from all good reason / and the which except most
great necessite did require it I suppose it not to be lawful to bring the^
into the ears and thoughts of honest men. Some things it contains that be
very tryfles and mete for nothing but to move men to laughter / and are of
alyaunce unto old wyffes tales. A gain some things be so craftily builded
after the symylytude of honesty and wisdom / that to the judgments of me^
they appear to be most holy ordinan^ces. Moreover therbe certain things
contained therein so like and agreeable to the law of Moses and doctrine of the
gospel / that a man would suppose at the tyrste sight they had been deryued
out of the fountain of celestyall oracles to Oracles divine answers or
sentences
teach men wisdom and to make them blissed. For Mahumet cries out of the
Iues infidelete / and he contendeth that Christ was conceived of the holy
golls and borne of Marye a pure virgyn. And he calls him the great Prophet
of God and the word and soul and spirit of God / which shall come to judge
the whole world. Nether would Mahumeth seem at any hand to be Christ's enemy
or that he would abolyshe his doctrine. But only to take upon him to correct
those things that were depraved and thruste in craftily of other men. Also
Machumetes doctrine does valiently resist certain oulde heresies condemned by
the word of god and judgment of the catholic church as of the
Anthropomorphites / which held opinion that god The ^^ere^^e of the
Anthrepomorphytes.
was compacte and had soche another body and members as a man. In conclusion
he cutteth the throat a sondre of the heathen superstition utterly denyinge the
pluralite of gods. Neither will he grant any use of Images in any manner of
wise to stand with religion. And lest I should make to long a process this
is the beginning the end and the hole sum of Mahumetes law / that there is
one only eternal and lyuinge god / which made The hole (...)me of Mahur^e
(...) la^^e breffely expressed
which does conserve and govern all things what so ever is contained within
the circuit of the round world. And that Mahumet being the cheffe messenger
of god and above all other knowing the secrets of his deuyne mind did never
teach or bring for the any thing to be believed or in the living of men to
be kept and observed which was not drawn or deryued owte of the very mowth
and heart of the true god. And that to believe him so faithful a master of the
truth is to believe god / which used so familiarly his prophet Mahumet / but
to reprove and despise him is as great an offense as to set even god him
selfte at haught / which had sent that heavenly doctor to instruct men in the
truth. And that the folowers of Mahumetes doctrine as the right begotten
children of faithful Abraham and ayeres of the deuyne pronises shall for a
truth receive in this world all manner of good things and in A very fay or
promise to make fools feign and a cruel threte to make cowardes afterd^^
the world to come to dwell for ever in paradise where they shall have plentye
of all manner of pleasure. But the conte^ners and for sakers of his law which
is descrybed in the autenticke instrument which they call Alcorane as the
wicked enemies of god they shall be plaged not only with temporal but also
with eternal pains and punisshementes / their souls being called a gain to
their bodies in the day of general resurrection. But let it be so that
Mahumets laws were brought in not by any sinful man / but by the holy prophet
of god / but by an archangell / and that not certain but the most part of them
all be a greable unto deuyne scripture. Let us also admit that all the
folowers of Mahumet be men most happy and fortunate / and let every one of
them howlde the kingedome of rich and prosperus Araby. And let their life in
an owtwarde show seem or apere to be most holy: Nevertheless because the
doctrine of Mahumet does not hold Christ for the head in whom only the
building of the house and people of god is ioyntelye knytte to gether. And for
as much as it Ephe. ij.
lays not the reasons or effects of religion and true beatitude upon the
foundation of the prophets and Apostles it is a pla^tatio^ not which the
celestial father has planted. But an erthely or rather a diuyllyshe

the roots with the spirit of his mouth. But what manner a foundation of the
everlasting verite is it whereunto the congregation or church of the godly
leans and cleneth fast and sure? Verily that Jesus of Nazareth crucified
under Po^tius Pylate dead buried is Christ very God and man in the unity of
person and sauyoure of all the world / but cheffely of the faithful / by
whose blood only and death and ryghteousnes comes all the remyssion of
sins / Romans iii. 1. Corin. ^
justification / redemption / the favor of God / eternal life and the
perfruitio^ of godly beatitude. But to whom is it granted to be partetakers
of soche a great and inestymable benefyte? To them that bye it for money? To
them that do challenge it by the trust of their own merit or any other
creature? No truly: But unto them that believe with the heart which does
iustyfye and knowledge with the mouth unto their health Christ to be their
savior: The which thing for as much as the Turks Rom^. ^.
profession does utterly deny and resist as much as it may. The eternal
veryte compels us to confess that this great multitude being in a manner
infynyte (the which to be remembered is an horrible thing) of Mahumetanes / of
Turks and Saracenes and of other nacyo^s / be not the people of God / but his
extreme adversaries and a very diuillyshe and a contrary sect. Which
holds not religion in reverence / but is taken in the snare and tayed fast
by the heles with the rustye fetters of cankerd superstition. Which does not
posses the divine promyses / but is subject unto thretenynges and most grievous
damnation / unto the which sect who so ever are joined heartily and with a fre
will: They do not walk in the way of true health and blyssed felicite. But
they cast themself headelinge into extreme darkness / into everlasting
death / into the fellowship of the dyuille and in to the deep whorlepole of
desperate infelicite. Where for I think it not good to pass by with silence
by what Author and in what time this most pernycious sect was first made /
the^ the which truly there was never any wother more largely opened and sprede
abroad / or that has co^tynued longer: many prodigyous signs and wonders
aperynge in the firmament / in the sea and in the earth to give warning before
hand that a great plage should come upon all the earth / oneles men would fly
unto the mercy of God / and correct the peruersyte of their evil disposytio^

IN the year from Christ's birth. ccccc and.lxxxvij. Mahumet was borne in a
village called Ittacip / not far of from the most famous city of welthy Arabye
called Mecha / nere to the red see. When and where Mahumet was borne.
At the which time Mauricius I can not tell whither I may say did hold or
spoil the Empire of Constantynople with couetuousnes and falshed and brybrye.
But Gregory by his syrname called Great / did exercise the office of the
Bysshopryke of Rome / which did lade and troble rather then tryme the church
with ceremonies. And he dydsome thing oppress the Christen relygyon it self.
And eue^ now there was a contention betwyxte the Bishops / as an evil
eggecasse in / for the prymacye of the church / John the Patryarche of
Constantinople requyrynge that in that city might be the head of all whother
churches: where there was both the seat of the Empire and the universal
Prelate of the cheffe church and general Bishop of all the whole Christen
world / which thing Gregorye the Romyshe puppet did let and forbid /
contendynge Rome to be the oulde or ancient seat of the Empire / and the
Romysh church builded of Peter not to be inferior to any whother: but the

much contention and stryffe of Phocas the Emperor which did succeed Mauryce

their own arbitriment. But you shall not do so. etc. Therefore the most
ambitious and cursed contention being spronge up betwyxte the bisshops of the
curch / Mahumet was borne: which constitutinge or ordininge a new
superstition and Kingedome might in process of time throw or cast out of
the church the most proud titles and lables of mytars and bragges of those
men wiche falsely usurp with most detestable pride for to be called the
vicares of Christ and drive them away even as one wedge dryueth out an
other. His fathers name was Abdalam by nation a Persian and an Idolater. But

was called Emma / borne of the trybe or kindred of Ismael / which people did
profess and knowledge yea even then the doctrine of Moses in so much that they
did circu^cyse their children / and did other things afther the manner and

things he turned unto the destcuction both of him selffe and of all the
world whiles he did follow his own euyll^ lusts and would not resist the
suggestions of the dyuille and did obey the most ungracious masters of
mischeffe. For by all the parts of his lyffe even from his child hoode
upward he was evermore doing and did bring for the most detestable deeds by
the wytnes and declaration whereof his mind was well known to be covetous /
cruel / unrighteous / desirous and very gredye of honor and dominion prone
and redye to all manner of foul and filthye pleasure. The proportion / beutye
/ or shape of his body was passing excellent and his might and strength very
great to sustain and hear all manner of labor / saving that through his
inte^perancye he had gotten at the last the falling syknes. He declared his
mind many manner of ways to be strong / valiante / and full of bouldenes
both to undertake and to drive a ways great dangers. His wit was quick in
consideration / and subtle in all the change and shyftes of polycye / and of
much abilite which way so ever he did bend him selffe. Here unto he had
also a fyled tongue and asmothe to utter his words with soche eloquence and

Neither did he want the science or knowledge of ars magic that is to say the
craft of conjuring / charmynge / and whitchecraft. And above all things he

Cap. vi
You have the order (o ye Christen men) brefely recyted of a dolorous piece of
work and most sorrowful busynes / by what authors the Turkyshe relygyon was
compacte and sowed together of diverse sects / and by what occasyon that evil
sect did first spring and break owte / the which ouerrunnynge by little and
little the parts of the world under the Turkysshe Empire / yea and beyond the
same is far and wide enlarged. And by what causes their empire did first
begin and afterward increace / whereby the Christen domynyon seems to be
brought into narrow lymytes and is daily wasted / made less / and
dimynysshed. Now what thing in the Turks affayers shall we first invade that
by contention we may the better behold the state and condition of Christian me^
/ and that the good and euyle things of both the parties laid as it were in
the balaunce of saint Michael may be browght unto the indifferent weyghte of
the truth? Shall we rebuke them for that they study or endeavor them selffe
with power and force of arms and not with reason to dilate and sprede abroad
theyer dominion and superstition? What man endued with a good mind ca^ praise
them for so doing? seeing that relygion is the gift of god and the work of
his holy spryte which can nether be browght in / nor driven owte by violence
of the breasts and minds of men. But in the same or in greater damnation are
the great head captains set next to the standarde of the Christen religion
for to defend it and the cheiffe heads of the Christen people which do
bannysshe and ^o^demne the doctrine of the son of god theier king / and
persequte it with fire and furye / and prescribe contrary doctry^es unto Christ
/ defend and thruste the^ ^^ by ^^^le^ce. Let certain decrees of the bishops
of Rome be looked upon. let the blodye statutes of those princes be known and
considered that are obedynt to the pope and will follow his lusts in all
things as thowghe they were his bondmen. How many innocent creature^ has
been spoiled of all theyer goods for the profession of the Christen verite with
in these xxty years in the which the goodness of god has given a more sincere
and brighter knowledge of Christ? How many have been marked with the whot^ iron
of most extreme infamye and put to open shame and pennaunce as they call it?
How many has been bannysshe^ and driven owte of their contryes with their
young and tender babes and wives? How many weeping eyes and heavy hertes has
been seen as in the days of Herod to be Mat. i^.
howlde. the pare^tes spoiled of their dear and best beloved children drawn
to their slaughter with great cruelnes as a sheep to the bochers stall or an
ox to the shambles? How many wydowes and orphans have been made for the
professyon of the gospel? Verily they can not be noumbred the which being
tormented and cruelly dysmembred / some in prysons and bongeous / some head^^
with swords / some strangled with halter^^ some put in sackes and drowned with
waters / some buried quycke / some bre^t with fire. Yea and if the truth may
be told / co^denmed of Christianes / has lost their lives / for the name of
Christ (ah less for sorrow) among the^ that are called Christen men by name:
so that soche as be innocents / and that favor the law of Christ from their
very hearts might live far away in much better saffegarde among the Turks
the professed enemies of Christ's name: then among the most blessed / and
most reverend / and most holy prelates of churches / and the sworn and
obedyent children of those named spiritual but carnal living fathers. May
the Turks be judged worthy of reprehensyo^ for that they will not suffer
their laws and doctrynes to be examyned by the rules of holy scripture / and
so to be proved as it were gold by the touch stone true or false? And that
they cry out and hold it for a very wicked thing to call back again into
the controuersye of dysputatyon statutes enacted well and wyselye and receyuyd
with the consent of a great nombre of people and confyrmed with the space and
time of so many worlds? Shall it displease us that men be put to death and
their heads with the sword stricken from theyer sholders which dispute but
one word age^ste Mahumets opinions. And that they be not rather denied
improued or resisted by the way of argument and disputation? What man having
knowledge of the Christen laws and custom can allow the same? Or at the least
way being not destitute of his right wit who will not rebuke it / and speak
agenst it? The Prophets did not All godly men were euer^ore pleased to have
their doctrine examined and tried
so / nether yet the Apostels nor any godly men in virtue and lyuyuge like unto
the Apostels / no not the philosophers of the best forte nor any other wise
and discrete men which did not abhore to have those sentences to be disputed
and examyned which they did believe to be most trwe. For why the truth would
be known / the truth would be boulted owte / and the truth desyrethe utterly
for to be seen. It hatethe darkness and above all things it loves light which
waxyth bright also by dysputatyon and being known it turnethe the hearts of
men unto it in whom is any desyer of the truth and veryte. But those men
which will not suffer their* doctrine / and their ordinauncys and deeds to be
Judged and determined / and by conuenyent disputation holden with reason to be
examined Truly they make them selffe to be worthelye suspected / that either
they know them selffes to be blinded with great ignorancye or else that they
love darkness rather then light / because their John.iii.

relygious explication of Christ's doctrine is required of them / and when false
persuasions be reprehendyd the which are made either through folysnes or else
for the evil and couetuous desyer of private proffyt / and are thruste in to
the congregations / partly by violence / and partly by craft and dysceyte* I
will towche a few things which in this owre time are more then known unto
Christen people / and yet be they done of many as it can not be denied: There
be certain heavy burdens layl^ in the necks of Christen me^nes conscye^tys as
the vows of the cloysterers and the syngle lyffe of preistes / which God does
not requyer / nether do they illustrate his holy name that is blyssed for ever
/ nor yet bring any manner of fruit or proffit unto men / but great loss and
damnable dan^ger both of bodies and sowles. Again there be some things very
well seen to have been browght in by violence in to the manners of the church
which differ so much from the lords divine pleasures that one egg is not
more like an other then the self same things are co^sona^t and agreeable /
either unto Iewysshe dotinge fables / as the choice and difference of meats and
soche whother tradytyo^s of man's will and pleasure wythowte the precepts of

saints / pylgrymages unto holy places / Romyshe pardons / iuglynges of

the living God. Let a man expert in divine scryptures and notablye studyous

Christian doctrine put those men to troble as most ungracious heretykes / which
teach that Images owght to have nether place nor use in religion / and the
which with good order take them owte of their temples? Upon the Turks side

famous clerk Origene: Origene.

habitations and is constrained by the diuersyte of bussines to dwell in diverse

fathers will lawghe my folishenes to scorn if I should lay to their charge
spiritual poligamy. For where as the apostle prescrybethe that a bishop
should be fawteles and the husband of one wyffe: the i. Tim. iii.
great clerks and owre illuminated doctors make interpretation that he must
be contented with one congregation. For this word wives must here be
vnderstondid and taken for temples / churches / benefyces / prebendes or
bisshoprikes: and yet there be certain fownde among these spiritual husbands
spiritually married to many women / that is to say benefyces after their own
interpretation* whose lust and pleasure the kysses and embracyngs of.xxx.

concerning polygamye is to be abhorred and does worthily displease me /
because it does resist the ordinance of god and what is to be judged of the
papisticall rules and decrees forbyddinge matrymonye to them: to whom god

But let us now descend to the civil laws which oneles they be te^pred after

doctrine they can not be just and godly. Therefore did Alexander emperor of
rome the son of Ma^meas so much regard the cheiffe point and in a manner the
hole sum of Christ's law* Do not thou to an other that thou woldeste not
have done unto thy selffe: that he caused it to be written in every place of
his palace and court. And when any* offenders were condemned by the law and
should suffer exeqution / he caused the said most worthy sentence by a common
officer called a criare to be recited unto them in the audience of all the
people sta^dinge by / whiles that sentence was given? And he truly was a much
wyser and a better prince for the commonwealth then was Philyppe afterward
which feigned him selffe to be the first of the emperoures of Rome that did
receive the catholic faith rather then that he did fauer in deed the
Christen religion from his very heart. Among the people and nation of the
Turks there be for a truth civil laws made which dyffer no thing from the
law of theyer relygion / supposed of them to be very trwe: but they garnyshe
and defend it / and those statutes are committed unto mete me^ which may
teach and interpret them Justly and truly with greateste faith and
reverence: whom theye call Calyfes. And the public weal is committed unto
Judges and ministers of Justice that are known and approved to be well
disposed persons and diligent kepers of the laws / that the place of Judgment
may fauer righteousness and not falsehed / iniurye / theft / and disceyte / and
that the emperor him selffe may obey the laws which by his authorite did
bri^ge the^ in / and requires them to be kept of the common people / so are
the people the more induced to observe the thing that is good and right whiles
they do (...) taken for the most excellent gift of god siphone be names of

as the noble Greek orator did long ago diffine where with the parts of a

that is to say the will of god / and applied unto honestye and the commune

god and man? Truly a great part of them takethe more pains then they be
thanks worthy to alter and transfourme those statutes that be most righteouse
and wholesome after their own lust / nether do they consider / as it should
seem / that they be occupied in an holy thing / but rather to suppose that
they had not to do with a reverent majesty and to have a lompe of claye
delivered in to their hands in the which (after the manner of potters) they
might prynte or fasshion what so ever Image and similitude they list / yea and
play the tryflers amongste them selffe. And the emperor and the empress are

with Nergall and Sacasar may set his throne in the gates of Hierusa^^ and
teach them to execute judgment and righteousness? But this place requires me
to speak of battle which thing my mind abhors / for as much as I have
not been accustomed unto tents and pauilyons Muses after the (...)ti^ of
poets are called the daughters o^ Jupiter and Mem^rye / by whom therefore is is
understand the knowledge and study of the lyberal sciences.
/ but rather unto learning and unto the Muses / I will there for speak a few
things. It is not only the civil decrees and statutes of nations that
permits me^ to keep just war. But the laws of god also and the examples
of most holy men gives suer knowledge unto the magistrates that they may
laufullye defend righteousness with the force of arms / for they are
commaundyd to carrye the sword unto the defense of good men and to the
oppression of the wicked. But it chances many times that Christen me^ d^
offend in the contrary part and it cumeth to pass that they put on harnes and
take weapons in their hands: not for righteousness / religion and lybertye / to
drive a way iniurye and despite / from theyer childerne / virgyns / wives
parents / fre^des / women oulde me^ country / from their howses / theyer
altares / and theyer temples: but wars are taken up for every light cause and
their are endyd or put down mosts shamefullye. Not the instytution or

In conclusion to compare the offices and duties of all ower men and those
things which be contrary to honestye and virtue by all manner off ways with
the manners of the Turks / it were an infinite labor. I will therefore towche the
matter co^pendiously and yet will I do it so largely as shall be sufficient to
discern the truth.

There is in the Turks a certain manifest manlynes and wise taking head / The
wise policy of the Turks before the beginning of theyer wars
and circumspectio^ in goinge a bowte theyer busynes. For before they begin
theyer wars or any other matter it is theyer propretye to council to gether
in the wisdom of words / which done / they do prosequte theyer purpose and
follow soche things as they take in hand very ernestly with strong and
mighty deeds. Nether ar there any labors so grievous and paynefull which they
do not almost suffer with incredible patience. In ower men allthowgh there be
no excellencye wantynge nether of wytt nor mind: yet I ca^ not tell how or by
what means that either to much cowardenes or faynte herted sluggyshenes
spryngeth up among them when they must take upon them any hard enterprise /
honest / and proffytable to the bublike weal: Or else we be carried
vnaduysedlye after the manner of wild beasts into great perelles which
chaunseth many times unto us through ower own rash folysshenes and the lack
off good co^syderatio^ in time. And therefore being strycke^ with great
impacie^cye / thowght and care / we The lake of good consideration in time

matter so unhappily ended which we had before so folyshely begun. And one
reprehendith an other if any thing fortune otherwise then according to their
opinion and expectacion where as the fawte is common and partayninge unto them
all. I will speak no thing of owre great intempera^cye in sportes / in
plays / in words / in living / in the filthy affayers of lady Venus / in

Another myll I say any thing of ower apparel which we change daily after the
manner of apes so that no thing offers it self so folysshe and worthy to be
lawght at / so that it seem to be a new trycke / which we do not delight to
follow. I will say no thing of ower pride and ower bostynge and crackynge not
of that virtue and good things which we have in deed. But wiche we falsely
feign for to have. Some men are so greatly given unto vain glory that they
rejoice in misscheffe and be well pleased / for that they be pore in virtue and
void os all goodness. I will pass over many soche other things of the same
kind / in the which the honesty of the Turks is seen to be greater the^ of
the common sort of Christianes: a miserable thing and yet (ah lase for
pittye) it is to trwe. But you peraduenter will say that the Turkyshe princes
and emperoures do burn with ambition that is to say the immoderate lust and
desyer of dominion / and they wrestle* as thowgh they were shytte up in some
narrow straytes among the large and most wide lands of so many kingedoms /
and they cease not to enlarge the costs of their empire. It is very trwe /
they do so in deed / but I would to God that they were syke alone of that same
disease and that a great nombre of proud and ambitious me^ were not to be

said. Except Mat. ^ (...)
you will receive the kyngedome of god as little children you shall not enter
in to it: To whom it is said. God ^. of Pe. ^.
resists the proud and gives grace to the lowly. For that I may pass over
with syle^ce the great contention that is among cyttezynnes who should be
taken as cheiffe / and how every man studyeth to exalte him selffe: That I may
hold my peace and speak never a word how princes draw out theyer swords
one against another / not only for the co^queste of dominion: but also for
the vain and usurped names and tytles of rule and authorite: Good god what
thirst is there of vain glory / honor and dignite? what fervent desyer of
promotion? what gredy and hungrye huntinge after (...) ge and selling and in
their bergaynes made hither and thither. What is in the more part of ower men
to whom the Lord said ernestly: except yower ryghteousnes Matthe. v.

entysed / retained / and brought unto the fellowship of Christ. And by what
way that thing may be obtaynyd he has largely and planely expressed in his
everlasting word. And that we might led a lyffe agreeable to so great and
soche an excellent profession: he replenisshed owre minds with his spryte
sanctifyenge: Nether did he orden us to be given to beastelye lust / as the
bondmen of the flesh. Nether did he bind us to the powers of the planetes.
Nether made he us subject to the dyuylles instigations. Nether would he have
us adicte to the conspyrations of the wicked. But that we being Luke. 1.
delivered from all ower enemies / might serve him the lord in holiness and
righteousness: Actuo. i.
he gave us his word and spryte to be the master and guide of owre living.
And that it should not grieve us to walk in the way of health: he moves /
prycketh forward / and provoke us there unto with many great and godly
promises / and those not vain. For why? God forbid that the supreme and only
veryte should make a lie. And he labors to drive away cowardnes and
sluggysshnes with horrible thretes prepared evermore not for the lovers / but
the dispysers of god / lest we should at any time sleep in death. Moreover he
has painted before owre eyes the condytyon both of the good people and
likewise of the wicked / with many great and noble examples in the monumentes
of holy scryptures / that I may speak no thing of other hystoryes / and that
I may pass over with silence those deeds which be done / we lokynge upon them.

But what is done with us (o you Christen men? How does owre manners / lyuinge
and deeds agree with the best approved learning of Christ? What fruit or
proffyt does owre celestial father receive of the fylde of his peculiare
people? What thanks do we render unto him for his infynyte and inestimable
benefytes? If we would knowledge the truth we do all things wyckedly: For why?
those men which ought not in any wise to be made like to the world in evil
things / nor to draw a yoke with the ^. Cor. vi
wicked / does so greatly degenerate and fall owte of kind from all godly
dysposytyon that they are fownde to be much warse then the manyfeste enemies
of the Christen religion. Look I pray you upon all the manners and deeds of the
common sort of the Christen people. In what obstynacye of mind / hardenes of
heart / dulnes of virtue / and wylfull blyndnes and ignorance of the truth /
live they? Consider all the parts of their life. Behold all the owtwarde
orders of the church / Bysshopes / Preystes / deacons / kings / princes /
Lords / Gentlemen / elders / cytezynnes / merchauntes / yemen / husband men /
masters / seruanntes. And how much do you se of Christen Godlynes? For Baal
was an idol* whereof meutio^ is made.iij. Reg. xix. therefore to bow knees unto
Baal is to honor and worshipfalse gods.
I speak nothing of them that keep themselves secret and be pryuely good men
/ and has not bowed their knees unto Baal. And I would to God that they being

Prince / and a noble patron of the Prophets of God / from whose indignation
Helyas flyinge supposed him self to be left alone which truly might worship
the God of Israel / but he is tawght by an oracle and divine answer that there
was reserved by the help of God seven thousand faithful worshyppers of the
Lords holy and woste reverend Majesty / which never had bowed their knees to
ydoles / nor did consent to the veneratio^ or worshyppynge of creatures. Under
a like manner iiii Reg. v
Naaman the Syryane was a faithful taptayne / and did trweseruyce to the king
his master / a cruel enemy to the Israelytes / and yet did he worship and
call upon the name of the trwe God of Israel / that Christ might prefer his
faith unto the disceytfull / colored / and painted holiness of the Jews. But
the church does not judge of things that be secret. Where fore I must
speak of the lyffe and manners both of the Christianes and of the Turks / as
far forth as they be many feste to the judgments of men. Therefore what virtue
will ye show in the men of owre time / which is not more louyngly favored
among the Turks? What thing can you allege to be done of the Turks untruly
/ cruelly / proudely / and immoderately / whereof there is not a like or a worse
example in ower men? Therefore There is none other thing the cause ^tower
euilles but ower own mis^che^^e.
the mouynges of the celestial circles or planates are not the parents of owre
calamities / as the vanyte of ower Mathematycall masters do tryfle / nether
has the prechinge of the gospel and (as some euylle mowthed slaunderes say)
the new sects of the Lutherans and Zwynglyans browght forth both these other
euyles / and also these destructions and iuiuryes done unto us by the Turkisshe
Mahumetanes: But ower manifest my kednes / but ower coutenmynge of gods
word. But ower dissolute / corrupt and abominable living / declaringe us to
be epicures rather then Christianes / has cast us in to these miseries / the
lord calling us back in vain / that the stepe and dau^gerouse ways of
perdition avoided we might enter in to felicite by a way that is plain /
saffe Easy / Ye and to the lovers of christ also iocou^de and pleasant Show
me the world that has been at any time more ungracious then owers? Show me
the people which being defiled with the vices of ower time / has eskaped the
wrath and punisshement of god? The longanimyte or the prolonged patience of
god will not suffer him selffe to be evermore despisyd. And he has warned us a
great while / he has gentlely exhorted us / he has fered us with wonderful
signs and terrible tokens / both in the heauenes above and in the earth
benethe. The cause wh^ god castt^th in his (...) and brings h^^ plage upon ^s.
But we being obstinate / hard hearted / and styffe necked / do still resyste

/ holy / and well willinge father casts in his rod among us that by the
smarte thereof we may know the stryker / which could not / or else rather
would not be ame^dyd whith any more gentle and softer handleynge. More over by
what enemies should we be punisshed more justly then by the Turkisshe
Mahumetanes / whom the sins of ower forefathers and cheiffely the perfidie /
that is to say the false breaking of promysys in falling away from the trwe
Christen faith and theyer unjust dealinge both with god and man / has
browght owte of the rokes of Caucasus: has lift them up from small

liberty to inuad Europe with their ships and galleys by that part of the sea that is called Hellespont. We do still norysshe them / and that they may go
on forward and attempt all things merely as they have begun* we leaving
to the vices of ower elders do minister unto them courage and audacite / so
that by the ryghteous judgment of god we way come at length unto like
confusion captivity and bondage. When abhor the name of a Turcke so that we
judge them as the most ungracious and wicked enemies of god and relygion / and
worthy to be slain with everlasting punisshement* Again they on the other
side perceyuyng the fylthynes of living that is among Christianes / ather by
heresaye / or else by that they have seen with theyer own eyes being present
among us / are so confirmed in their superstition. That their judgment is
they should be the children of hell fire / if they would change the received
manner of their lyuinge with the Christen relygion: that they had rather suffer
death then to come in to ower churches on every It abhors the Turks t^ to
se and perceive owre abominatio^s
side polluted with Maumettes and Idols: that they being browght by some
train or chance in to the howses of ower most reverend fathers / and
beholdinge the pumppe of their pestiferous and most stynckinge vices / do take
them to their legs / and they fly away from them as it were from the
burninge of Sodom (...)
and Gomorre: that they do suppose they can not give unto god any greater
honor / or do him better seruise / then to endeuer them selffe / to their
vttermoste power / to destroy ower pride / to murdre ower people / to waste
ower contreys to spoil ower kingedoms / to overthrow ower cyttyes / and lay
them flatt with the ground. The Turks therefore do rise up into judgment
before the seat of Mat. xii*
god the judge and Gouernoure both of heaven and earth with the Christen
generation so greatly degenerate and fallen out of kind / and they do accuse
them for to be only Christen men in their names and words. But with their
deeds to deny all manner of godlynes. The Turks I say bear wytnes against us
/ that they being made and fasshyoned after the laws of Mahumet / have more
virtues and less vices then we: whom therefore we do hear Again of saint
Paul* In Roma. ij.
that thou iudgest an other / thou condemneste thy selffe because thou doste

the same things: We hear of ower lord God thou evil servant. I judge the
euene of thine own mouth and of thine own words I do condemn the. The
Turks being righteous men in comparyson of the vain braggers of the Christen
religion are allowed and destinated of God for to punish his church so fowly
disfigured and to correct her with soche punisshement as is dew for a woman
taken in aduowtrie / For why? she has broken her wedloke and violated the
couenau^te confirmed with Christ's blood in following of false gods in whom
she has put her trust. She which is Christ's spouse is no thing affrayde to
hurt him with spytefull injuries with fallse breakinge of promise / and with
most great vnkyndenes^ And therefore do ower enemies truly dispoyle and take
away ower riches which we denied to the pore / yea rather to Christ
requiringe them in the pore. Which we did rather give to Idols and to
scoffing knaves and raylers and we owerselffe usurped them to the great
superfluite of ower carnal lust and pleasur and not to the necessary use of
ower lyuinge. They waste ower lands / they led us away prisoners owte of
ower own sweet co^treies in the which we regarded not to worship god truly or
to seek diligently for the kingedome of heaven. In the which we did not study
for the conseruacion of the publycke weal / but as the wicked betrayers of
ower contreye we applied ower minds / not to virtue and godlynes / but to
tyranny / pryuate proffit and all manner of misscheffe. They take away ower
liberty / which we most unthankful and ungracious wretches did turn all
together in to the seruyse of sin / they tear ower flesh and they wound

spytes and scorns because we do not keep them as the most holy temples of
god. But do daily pollute them and have made them the brodell howses of Venus /
Mammon / Bacchus and of all vnclenlines. They rip^ the bellies and cut the
throtes a sondre of ower young infants and sweet little babes taken away by
cruel violence owte of the bosom / and arms of theyer parents. Or else
they keep them up to make them slaves taide fast with chains to row in
theyer Gallyes / and do reserve them to a miserable lyffe / because that they
being borne unto Christ and dedicate unto God are not browght up among us with
soche virtue and diligence as is convenient / fit and agreeable to the lords
request. The husband and his wyffe be rent a sondre and are carried away into
strange regious very far of the one from the other because that matrimony is
so greatly abused / carnally polluted / viciously corrupted / and is not
holden in reverence according to the honor and dignite there of. Ower de rely
beloved parents are taken away from us because we nether give unto them dwe
honor for theier great cares Deuter. b
and pains taken in ower bringinge up: nor yet worship truly and in spirit
and verite ower celestial father which is in heaven. Ower brotherne also

us by dyuine kynred we do not so greatly embrace / with holy love / that we
can find in ower hearts to help and socure them: but we are better contented
nether to be idle nor yet well occupied in goinge about with spiteful malice
to do them displeasure / to slau^dre and to hurt them And lest that many
should be borne the children of the church (which know legynge the one only

Cap. xi
NOw are the wells and runnynge spri^ges of all those evils showed and
discouerd which redounde or flow out of Thracia into Germanye and threteneth
a great floodde unto Europe and that for be cause that the people professynge
the Christen religion that is to say the true and only and perfyt religion
does not perform in theyer manners and living any thing at all or else
suerly very little: that is agreeable to the doctrine of Christ / in so much
that the Turks the professed enemies of trwe religion / the vphowlders of the
sta^darde and the most sharp defenders of Mahumetes superstition do excel
ower men (which have but the names and not the deeds of Christians) in the
godly use and exercise of righteousness and of all other virtues / and they
sin more moderately. This is also the disposition of god and his perpetual
custom / as the divine scryptures (...) eute / and the hysto(...)s done /
bears record: (...)pen unto men the pleasu(...)l will / and does monys(...)e
what is to be done and (...)uoydyd. And he calls (...) as go owte of the

repentance and amendment o(...) uynge / or else utterly destroy us (...)
bring us to confusion.

Therefore now (o you Christian men) (...) ought for to think of the remedy of
(...)se euylles / and we must seek owte some good haven that is with owte
danger / and by what rowing or by what governance we may arryue in to it /
and escape these cruel tempests and dangerous ragynge sees: For they that
have small substance / and the which are diseased with dett / do not suppose
it to be enough to have known the causes by the which they did fall in to
those myseryes / but they labor dylygently / except they want reason and their
right mind that they may come owte / and be d^^^uered of soche danger and
dett / and that ever more afterward they may take heed that they slyppe not
again into the same mysfortune. And they which are wrapped and taken with the
fevers / the ague / or any other manner of syknes / are not contented only to
learn the causes of their disease / but they search owte studyously some
medycyne / if they be wise / that they may be restored unto their good health
/ and know the reason how to preserve the same* which may defend them after
wards from like euylles ha^gynge over their heads: How much more truly is it
convenient for us to seek owte not only for what things the wrath of God is
styrde up against us and owte of the same both other calamytes / poverty of
things / murrayne / pestilence / seditions / and also the most greuouse
wars of the Turks: But more over to gather together the most suer reasons
and means to please god / that the euylls supressinge or thrustinge us down
might be removed. And that they come not again hereafter: to provide with ripe
and perfect council in dwe time And that ower many and great offenses are in
the cause that god being a^grie may deliver the people / which bear the name
and Sacraments of Christ / in to the hands of their most grievous enemies:
it is manifestly* declared as I suppose. Now that we may please the celestial
majesty and take away the causes of all ower euilles there can no thing be
browght better and more sure then that which is the most sincere and brefeste
concell. Truly that ower ungracious deeds being amended and ower contumacye
and disobedience seta side / by the which we have despised hither to the
precepts of the lord ower god and father: we may come again in to favor with
the gouernoure of all things. The same thing how much it is honest and
fayer / and how it owght to be done with greateste study / all thowgh none
other proffit thereof should be set forth: it has no need of probatio^. For
why? seeing it is a foul thing to offend ower parents / or ower kinsefolke /
or ower friends and companions / or any other deserving well of us / and by
ower offense to break frdeship / a fowler thing to bear hatred still / a
most foul thing not to will to do ower diligence that the offenses might be
taken away / and frendeship renewed: What a more unworthy thing is it and
joined to gether with greater fylthines / to have offendid ower celestial
father / which has garnished us with infinite benefits / and to proroge
enmitye and not to will to be browght again in to favor with him that was
hurt / and may by good right utterly destroy us / and yet he rather requires
us to eschew the pains and to posses with pleasure his goodness never spente?
That repentance and amendment of lyuinge is truly proffittable unto all men /
cyttyes / people / and kyngedomes. The stories of the bible do teach every
where and it is recorded in very many places of the holy scripture planely
pronounced. Owte of the which only / we will towche a few things. For
Hieremye the.xviij. Chap. declarynge the parable of the pottare / in whose
judgment it is set / to break the vessel quickly now being made or being
broken to make it again: Towcheth very plesantly the power and strength of
repentance or of the new ame^deme^t of the formore life that he might drive
away the euyls ha^ging over ower heads and so greatly eue^ now suppressinge
or thrustynge us down on every side. For even thus he says. May not I do with
you as the pottar does (o you house of Israel) says the lord / behowlde ye
house of Iere. xviii
Israel ye are in my hand even as the claye in the pottars hand. I will
speak suddenly against a people and against a kingedome that I may root it out
/ destroy and waste it / but if that pepole against who me I have so devised,
co^uerte from their wickedness. I will repent also of the plage that I had
devised to bring upon them. What ca^ be spoken more clearly? The orator of
best approved faith and most worthy to be believed makes promise with the
words of god that he will call back his punysshement / if men will amend
theyer sins for the which he had determined to plage and correct them. For
god does not keep war with man kind. But he perscuteth ower offenses and
desires to save the people the very work of his fingers. Nether owght the
twysted and dysagreable interpretations of sophisters to be herd of
thretenynge of diffinytion and predestinatyon. But the promise of god is to be
embraced and houlden sure with all ower heart / even as it were with an holy
Anchore: which does promise remissyo^ of sins and forgyuenes of pain unto
all men how many so ever will by his help amend their disposityon / and
manners and deeds. In the which thing god is not changed nether is there with
him any inconstancye The nature* and merciful inclinatyon of God to ward us
most miserable sinners.
of whose nature this is the propretye: to will well unto all men / to help
them / to exhort the^ to endeavor the^ selffe for to take health. To call
them back from perissheynge. To chasten them with whyppes / to spare them
being ame^dyd and to enryche them with good things. O the ineffable clemencye
of god which stryueth to make his enemies and traitors / his friends with
loving kyndenes. O the most merciful sweet and confortable voice a
faythefull witness of greateste goodness and declaringe to careful synne^s the
most sure hope of health. What speaks Ezechiel unto the Israelytes of his
time / when the lord had thretened a great while by his servants the
Prophets that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon should destroy the nation of
the Iwes oneles they would amend? If I say unto the wicked thou shall suerly
dye / and so he turns from his sins and does the thing that is laufull and
right in so much that he gives Eze. xviii
the pledge again / restores that he had taken away by robbery / walks in
the commandments of lyffe and does no wrong: then shall he surely live and
not dye. And a little above i^ the same chapter it is furthermore added / as
truly as I live says the lord god I have no pleasure in the death of the
wicked. But much rather that he would turn from his sin and live. Turn you
Turn you (O ye of the house of Israhel) Oh wherefore will you dye? These and
many such wother things does god speak by his Prophet Ezechiel the.xxxij.
and the.xviij. Chapters / which do well express the power of repentance and
of turnynge again to the mercy of the lord and the study of godlynes. But
what thing should we God has sworn to be merciful to us if we will repent.

which for as much as it is a thing most worthy to be known* I will rehearse
it in Inglyshe words / which is some thing more agreeable to the scripture of
the Hebrew then the common translation of the Latyne: Jehovah / Jehovah / Deus

for all that not leauinge them all ways utterly vupunysshed visitynge the
wyckednes of the fathers upon the thyldre^ and upon the chyldre^s children unto
the third and fowrte generation. But that the same thing also is perfourmyd
with deeds that this description teaches to be in the nature of god: both the
holy scriptures and the Ecclesiastical hystoryes do sufficiently bear record
/ that we may pass over and speak no thing at all of other strange and
profane matters / and how easy and gentle the lord is to them that repent.
More over what an houlesome and goodly medicyne the chaungynge of owre
dispsition and manners after the rule of gods law is unto ower miserye: the
register or commmentarye of the Iwes affayers under the administration and
governance of the judges does teach very well. For Iosue being dead and that
people which had perceived the works of the lord in the days of Moses and
Iosue being Judges over them: they that came after them immediately did cast
away from them the worship of the true god / and they served Baalim and other
creatures after the manee of the heathen to whom they did give false
existimation of divine power. Wherefore the lord waxinge angry / delivered

and prepare yower hearts unto the lord and serve him only / and he shall ryd
you out of the hands of the Philistines. What did they at lenght? The children
of Israhel removed Baalim and Astaroth and they served the lord only. But the
people being gatherd to gitther in Maspha Samuel did give commaundament and
called the publyke weal back again to the laws of god / where they did also

Samuel also / which in the name of all the people should heartily desyer the

a soden fear upon his vncircuncysed enemies / so that part of them were
slain of the Israelites / and part of them recovered the^ selffe in to their
country with most shameful flight / which victory they did ascribe full and

under as the story of the kings says / nether did they attempt any more
that they might come in to the costs of Israel / and the hand of the lord
was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel / and the cytyes were
restored again unto Israel which the Palestines had taken away. But why so I
pray you? Verily because Samuel was in very deed a godly rular of the publyke
weal and therefore did govern and regard the same: and not the vain name and
feigned person as it were in some play or tragedy of a good prince: for he did

plowed like a field / and Jerusalem shall become an heap of stones / and the
hill of the temple shall be turned into an hye wood. Shall we suppose God to
have spoken those things in sport? Was it his will to move their minds with
vain threatenynges that they might as children be suddenly taken with vain
fear? No truly: but the same thing was declared by Micheas that they had
deserved / and that God would do unto them. All though with no herd condytyon
/ that if they would repent: by the mercy of God they should be saved. Therefore

the city of Jerusalem round about with a grievous seyge: but he did not
talie it / as Micheas / as Esaias / and as other dyuyne Prophets had thretened
with the word of God. Why so? Verily because Ezechias and Judah did fear the
Lord and prayed before his face. And the Lord repented him of the evil /
which he had spoken against them: even as it was bosted of the elders in the
congregation of the people / which defendyd Hieremye against the qwarelynges
of false prophets and preistes / as it is written the.xxvi. Chapter of

and showed them all his treasures for a boste and a pride: the prophet Esaye
did Esa. xxxix

Whose Son Manasses laden with all manner of myscheffe was taken prisoner and

corrupt state of the people did correct with most sincere diligence the
seruyse of god and the politic order of the public weal fallen in decay
after the rule of the holy bible. Therefore Josias being a live the Chaldeis
did keep no war with the Iues: But when his children which iiij. Reg* xxiij.
an^ xxiiij
rayned after him: Ichoahaz / Iehoakim / Zedekia and their Neuye Iehoacin did
govern the kingedome most ungraciously and would not be called back with the
preachinges of the prophets: Zedekia and his councellers and the false
prophets did both bring the^ selffe / and also the people and the hole
countreye unto destruction. And yet the most steadfast prophet Hieremie (which
many times had towlde before hand that the cyttye Jerusalem should be taken
Iere. xxi and xxxij. and xxxvij. a^^ xxxix.
of the Chaldeies / and that the temple and howses thereof should be consumed
with fire / and the king with his childrene to be handled most wrechedly in
the beseygeinge thereof) when the time was at hand that they should be
expulsed: did promise Zedekia with the words of god / that if he would deliver
up him selffe and the cyttye in to the hands of the chaldeis / with who^ Eze.
xvij.
he had broken his oath and promise before: he should both be gentlely
entreated of the king of Babylon. And the city also with their goodly temple
and other holy things should not be destroyed. What ca^ be brought more clear
to declare the proffyt of unfeigned repentance: Which in the last article of
troblesom pain was so great a socure unto the Iwes? And lest any man should
suppose the said godly virtue called repentance to be at any time in this
world unprofitable or over late? even as it is said in the common proverb:
it is to late to spare in the bottom: the example of the Nyniuites does teach
To spare in the bottom / that is to say when all to spent.
us abundantly. For after that God had reproved the most ungracious myscheffes
of the said cyttye / and towlde them that Niniue should be overthrown with in
fortye days: first the inferior people and then after ward the king
endeavored the^ selffe very ernestelyeto amend theyer manners. And they we
returned unto the mercy of the lord. And God dydle theyer works and how they
were converted from theyer evil way / and he changed his decre of sode^
vengeance to be browght upon them / Nether did he destroy them as he had
Jonas.iij. and.iiij.
spoken by the prophet Jonas / whose evil affection God also reproved for that
he was sorye to be cowntyd as a false and lyinge prophet the city being saved
to the which he had prophesied extreme subuersio^. Whereby it is evident that
there is no thing more pleasant unto God* then that men with the amendment of
theyer disposition and manners might avoid the sword of his celestial wrath
shakyd at theyer heads. And allthowgh that every hole nation or city will not
put away their vices: yet the amendment of some and syngulare men is very
acceptable unto the lord. And it optayneth the putting away of urgent pain
and grievous punissheme^t or else truly a mitigation thereof if we must needs
be slain with the stubborn hearted. For when the Gothians did invade Rome
Halarich and Radagaste being Halarich and Radagaste head Captains to the
Gothians
their Captains / a great part of the cyttezynnes were infideles / and they
laid all the cause of that cruel war, and destruction upon Christen
religion / and the despised honourynge of ydoles. And they required their
temple and abolysshed superstitions for to be restored and set up again. An
other part of them puttyng their trust in God / and flyinge to his celestyall
help / by their prayers made in the name of Christ obtained remission of all
theyer sins. Therefore the cyttye being taken / Halarich the emperor of the
Gothians did command that no man should be spoiled in the temples of the
Christianes / wherefor the good people flyinge to the lords howses as in to a
Saynctuarye were defendyd by the help of God and amongst them certain in
infideles I ca^ not tell whyther I may say professynge or suddenly faynynge the
christen relygion. When in the mean time the cyttye was defyeled with
robberyes slaughter / fire / the forcynge of women and rauysshynge of virgyns.
At the same time the Duke or captain of the Hu^nians called Subtarus the
brother of Mazuchus which brought forth Attyla Subtarus the brother of
Mazuchus father to Attyla borne in Scythia / and called the scourge o^ god for
the great destruction that he made in Germanye / which after he had sub dued
Hungary and over thrown Aquncia / a cytty in Italye / returning home again /
dyed and was choked with immoderate bledynge
the scourge of god / the gothianes and the Germans being dyuersely vexed:
did invade the Burgundions which have theyer habitation by the river called
Rhene / the formar inhabiters thereof being driven away / that the same thing
might chaunse unto them that Publius Mimus does teach. Thou must look to be
dealte with all thy self as thou dealeste with other men. Wherefore the
Burgu^dions utterly mystrustinge theyer own power / might / and weapons: do
turn them all to gether to the help of god. And forbycause they had served by
the common fame / that the God of the christianes does evermore help his
devout clientes whith his most present power: They do all with one consent
embrace the faith of christ. And the.vii. day from theyer baptism three
thousand Burgundions did come upon the infinite multitudes of theyer enemies /
and ten thousand of them being slain together with theyer Duke: They
constraynyd the residue with fearful flight to recoyle back to theyer own
contrye: Truly how much goodness the chaungynge of an evil ordered lyffe does
bring unto men: can not to be showed in this place / and it is every where
declared in the doctrine of godlynes.

Chapt. xij.
IT follows therefore that I may teach it to be an Esaie thing to tra^sfourme
ower living and to put away the bourde^ of iniquite / for the which the
ve^geau^ce of god both with other instruments / and also with the weapons of
the turks inuadith christendom with ragynge violence / so that we do not
disdain to use those facultyes which god him selffe does offer unto the same
thing / and to walk in the right way which the holy scriptures does show /
and not the feigned traditions inuentyd by sophysters of contention / confession
and satisfactions. But lest I should be to full of words in a matter that is
very plain I do think or judge repentance as it is taken after the manner of
divinity / for the amendeme^t of all ower lyffe and a new returninge unto god:
to be very well diffined in the words of the.xxxvi. Psalm / which also be
repeted in the Epistle written unto the Hebrews after this manner. Depart from
evil and do the thing that is good and dwell for ever. Now we understood
that thing to be good / that is right and honest. Again we houlde that*
thing to be evil that is false and filthy: of the which.ij. things god
does allow the one / he commaundith and perswadith and promyseth gifts unto it
/ and he prayseth and honors and rewards it. The other he improueth / he
forbiddyth / he dyswadith / he rebukes and he persequteth it with pain and
punisshements. Therefore What it is to do penance and to repent truly.
to do penance / as dyuines speak / and to correct ower lyffe is to cast
out of ower mind and all the purpose and manner of owerlyuynge / those things
/ which be co^traye to the will of god / whither we ower selffe received them
by ower own affection and error / or whither they wear delivered unto us by
some other men / as it were with hands / and to do / yea and with greatest
study to ensue those things which are a greable unto the supreme law and
most perfyt reason / that is to say unto the mind of god / so that he which
before time did superstitiously worship things created: let him now
religiously worship only the true living god / Which before was perjured /
may now keep his oath and perform those things where unto he is sworn:
Which before was an homicyde may now abhore from slaughter and blood? Which
before was a breaker of wedloke and an unclean person may now houlde matremonie
in holy reverence and live chastely: Which did hurt his brethren with craft
and gyles may now abstain from injuries and do good to as many as he is able
to proffit. Unto the which thing there is need of a sure and perfyt knowledge
of sin and virtue / which the book of the ten commandments of the law of
god does breffely express / and also the doctrine of Christ which with his
passion and death does iustifye the wicked with owte any of their own works /
or of any creature so, that men only will know them selffe to have ofte^ded
and confess the same unto god against who^ they have sinned and which alone
by him selffe may forgive sins: and let it not grieve me^ only that they have
leapte over the divine laws / but let them houlde also a sure purpose and
study from henseforth to live after the prescrybed cou^cells of gods word.
Soche repe^tau^ce the true worshippers of god owght evermore deuoutely to
remember / the which is allwaye both effectual and houlesome / purifyinge
the hearts with faith and the which does lose the knotte of all ower sins /
so that god does not remember them any more / as the Prophets Eze. xviij.
are wont to speak / That is to say / he does not impute that they shole be
tormented with pain appointed / for why that were to requyer and persequte
sins and not to forgive them. Nether does god receive any other satsfaction
then the blood add death of his only begotten son which the true faith
does knowledge leuynge to the remission of sins / and not to being and
selling like hucksters that the fine may begyue^ to the preistes which they
have ordined / and that part of ower sins might be redeemed of pardoners and
part scowerde away in the fyers of purgatory. Truly the church is satisfied
when she seyth a man changed and conuertyd unto virtue and godliness / that he
which did lately offend wiht wickedness and filthy lyuinge unworthy of the
compayne of holy men: now being tra^sfourmed by the grace of god: brings
Joy and is houlden worthy of the folowship of the church. Truly we do not
disalowe that he whose mind is trobled with any dangerous dowte cast in to
his conscience should ask council of me^ that are expert in divine matters

reason by the which in time to come he may be ware to offend god. But to

no thing can be brought to pass. But there be many reasons at hand where
with all this opinion should be proved false if I wear dysposed to apply my
mind. Nevertheless by the most evident examples of ower time / faith can
not be taken away at no hand. For why how many things within these few
years be there correctid both in many places / and not in one time nether by
any couenau^te or promise made before: but only by the prescription of the
holy scriptures / which the superior magistrates went abowte to keep back
very obstinately? And can not all other matteres that are behind be redressed
under a like manner? May not other cyttyes being also wrapped in papisticall
trifles do the same thing which we se to be done of the^ all ready / which
being inferior in riches and lenynge to the help of god: has proved to set
upon a thing very excellent and holy and necessary? Does not the Romish

said that they cowlde not put away the resydue of the Chana^ites: But why
so? verily because they would not: But they might have abolyshed with very
little busynes all the Chananites / if they despysynge the commandment of god
had not preferred cowardely idleness before the most holy busynes / and that
with the greateste loss of theyer own goods as they did shortly after prove
it in deed. And lest that either every man or else every cyttye should cover
the difficultye of their cowardenes in renewinge of religion and righteousness:
the lord has set forth Niniue the cheyffe cyttye Niniue

that might make repentance I say not very hard* but plainly i^possible. For
why? first of all this very great and most rich cyttye did flow and swyme

alltogyther in few words: it was a world with all her malice brought with in
the precinct or bridgeme^t of one wall. And those mycheffes had continued by
the space of a thowsande and.ij. hondereth years and more / and they were
turned by most long custom into nature. Also The Nin^uites wa^ted no th^ge

the long continuans of theyer most ungracious deeds did cast against theyer
shynnes the desperation of health. For who may suppose that the dyuyll did not
move his instruments / that he might posses for ever the cheiffe head of his
kyngedom? Or who can deny that god was not angry and displeased with the
Ninevites for soche great abominations / namely seeing he thretened utter
destruction unto them with in fourtye days? Never thelesse the Ninevites* at
the only prechinge of Jonas the prophet a strange and an unknown man / and
the which had little prevailed in long prechinge amongste his country me^ the
Jews / and as a runagate was lately brought in to the office of a prophet: did
suddenly turn unto the only true God / so that every man departing from his
iniquite did call for Jonas. iii
the mercy of the Lord. Nether did the people tarry for the decreis of their
most mighty king that they might refer so great a busynes unto the kings
council and then in conclusion to set upon the renewynge of a better lyffe if
yt should be his pleasure. The king also being The king of Niniu^ had not the
people nor the people the king to be the author of their repentance: but both
the people and the king had God for their Author.
ignorant of the will of his people / decreyd with him self to amend his
lyuinge / and he performed it with deeds / so that nether the king had the
people to be the Author of his deed nor the people the king to be the Author
of theyer deed: But both the king and the people had god for theyer author /
whom they believed being warned by his prophet / which did reprove theyer
wicked abominations and did denounce the pain thereof by the righteous
judgment of god. Wherefore ower cowardenes and luskyshenes does make at this
day that to renew divine honors / the sincere doctrine of faith / the
ceremonies delivered of Christ and truly observed of the holy fathers / the
sincere health or honestye of mind / the innocentye of living / the
estimation or the honoring of justice / and of all virtues / semethe to be a
warke very hard and difficulte and full of parell. But this most heavy sleep
with out waking which owr first parent Adam has sent unto us / a thing
pertaining after the flesh to ower inheritance does cast soche a myste
before ower eyes and judgment / that we desyer righteous things and we desyer
them not: and we are vexed with the false fantastical images of greatest
difficultyes: like as it where the slouthful man / which in the proverbs of
Solomon says. There is a lyo^ Prouer. xxvi.
without / and I shall be slain in the mydest of the streets. And a lyones is
in the way. Like as adore turns abowte upon the post where upon yt hangs
/ even so does a sluggarde welter him self in his bed. The slowthfull luske
puts his hands under his harmeholes and it greueth hi^ to put them again
unto his mowth. Therefore that evil vice of sluggysshenes is to be thrown of
with virtue / and religion is to be styrred up with godly zele / that ower will
may apply it selffe to perform those things that God does command / and
to drive away those things which god does improve / and that we may strongly
resyste the vain fears of the world and the diuyll. By a proof the things
are many times found easy / which seems very* hard.
And it shall be known by a proffe those things to be very easy / which
seemed to be most hard* that grownde to be very plain / which did apere to
soche as were blind to be full of deep devouring goulffes: Those feldes to be
fair and open / where they supposed to have seen most hye tops of hills.
Why therefore do we not follow the example of king Alexander of Macedonye?
which when he was Alexander of Macedonye.
full of mela^coly humors and by his nature most inclyned to sleep / taking
his rest / was wont evermore to howlde in his hand a baulle made of silver /
which falling down in to a brazen basyne that was under nethe / might stir
up his mind unto the remembrance of those things that were most worthy for a
most mighty emperor. Often and many times owght we to remember what hope
what rewards are set before us if we will houlde fast the commandments of
god: and what pains be ordined unto them that regard not his holy precepts.
The redynge of holy scripture owght dylygently for to be applied. We must use
one to exhort an other / and one to do for an other. Every man owght to strive
that he may run before in the warkes of god / and not to come lagge behind /
and as a cowardely souldioure to follow the hyndermoste part of the host.
The most goodly The godly examples of most holy men must be evermore set
before ower eyes.
examples of holy men are to be set before ower eyes and to be looked upon: as
of patriarchs / prophets / Aposteles / martyrs / confessors / matrones /
vyrgynes / children / in whom a fires strenghte of godlynes did excercyse it
self / and in whom the word of god was well declared to be of soche effect:
that kingedomes did yield and give place unto it / yea and all the hole power
and might of the world. Let relygion only be well inte^dyd with virtue annexyd
there unto: and God shall prosper with his present spryte all the noble acts
that we go a bowte. Wherefore to dispute with any longer process of this virtue
repentance how easy and how profittable a thing it is / may seem unto any man
to be but a vain or superfluous thing / seeing that most extreme and last
necessite lies upon us to renew the true honor of god and righteousness:
oneles we be fullye determined to put ower wives / children / parents /
brethren / friends / country / liberty / and in conclusion ower selves wholye
in to the hands and arbitrament of the nation of the Mahumetanes. For why? Wko
has brought the Turks out of the rocks of Caucasus in to Christendom?
Verily the corrupt living and sins of the Chrystianes / for saint Hierome

the same thing: whose words I will reh(...) in the stead of a conclusion.
Who did exalte the Turks unto the dominion of Asya and Europa and Affryca?
Ower sins: for why the stories of ower received faith do declare the same.
Who has browght them to the costs of Italye and Germany? Ower great sins:
which thing Palatina a very wise man and of great approved virtue does
knowledge in the lyffe of the Bishop called Marcellyne which at the
commandment of Diocletiane was crowned with martyrdom. For where as Eusebius
in the beginning Eusebius
of the.viij. book of the hystorye called Ecclesiastical / does attrybute the
cause of most grievous perseqution unto the sins of the Christen people:
Platina / which under the puppet Sixtus the.iiij of that name / did descrybe
the lives of the Bishops of Rome: does apply it very well unto his time. But
that you may perceive in the mean season ower time also for to be payntyd. He
writes verily after this manner: This calamyte which ower men has suffered.
Eusebius affirms to be permytted and suffered of God / for the manners of the
Christen congregation being corrupted with over much lybertye and pardon. But
namely of the clergy. Whose peruersite the righteous judgment of God did
determyne to bridle with soche perseqution whiles he did behold dissimulation
in theyer countenance / Gyle in theyer heart / and disceyte in their words.
For they stryuynge amongste them selffe with envy pride / debates / and
hatredes / did seem rather to play the tyrants the^ the preystes / being
utterly forgetful of Christen godlynes and pollutynge divine mysteries rather
then celebratinge the^. But what do we suppose will come to pas in ower time in
the which ower vices are grown so farforth that they have sca^tly left unto
us with god any place of mercy? How great covetousness there is among preystes
and namely them which do posses greateste promotions and riches. How great
lust and carnal pleasure there is had one every side. How great Ambytyon
and pomp. How great pride and Slouthefulnes: How great ignoraucye both of
them selffe and of the Christen doctrine: How little relygyon and that false
and feigned rather then true. How corrupt manners worthy to be abhorryd / yea
even in profane men whom they call seculares: it partayneth not to speak /
seeing they sin openly and in the face of all the world after soche a manner
as thowgh they sowght to be praised therefore. Believe me / the Turk will come /
would to god I were a false Prophet yea he will come in deed a more vyolent
enemy of the Christen name then Dis clesiane and Maximiniane. Even, now he
knoketh upon the walls of Italye. We sluggardes and full of sleep do look
after a common destruction: gyuynge head rather to ower own pryuate pleasure
then to the common proffit. Hitherto wrighteth Platine. But for as much as the
Turks affayers are not known unto all men and seeing they have a very great
respect unto my purposed consultatyo^ / this place seems to requyer that the
first origynal and increaceme^tes of the turkysshe empire might be
compendyously towched by every principal part there of / never the less
some thing more depely then in ower beginning before rehearsed / that it may
be seen most evidently / that the riches power and dominion of ower
adversaries has encreaced through the sins of the Christen people. And that
there shall be none end of ower euyls which the Turks bring in upon us:
except that we forsakynge ower ungodliness and most ungracious sins / will
fly unto celestial helps and socoures.

Chap. xiij
AVthors worthy of credyt do attrybute the habitatio^ of the Turks to be at
the mou^te Caucasus between the Sarbarousnes of the north and the fyers
Scythya^s / as Po^ponius who says that Pomponius.
they do inhabyte great wyldernes and sharp with contynuall rocks and also
the same Pliniu^.
says Pliny. And I am easaly persuaded to believe the Thuscanes to be named
in Ptolomye for the Turks / the letter. ^^beinge changed that. S. might be
written in the stead thereof. And the most expert men in the Hebrew tongue do
judge the Turks to be named of Thogorma / Gene. x ^. Chron. 1
the son of Gomer / Neuye to Iapheth. The which kynred with Gog and Magog
following Antiochus, that most cruel tyrante called Epiphanes / that is to
say illustryous did scourge the Jews according to the prophecy of Ezechiel
written in the.xxxviij. and.xxxix. Chapters / about the houndreth and fourtye
years before the birth of owre Lord. At which time the war of Antichrist was
greatly fygured by the stryuynges of Antiochus King of Syria and of the
Machabees. Where upon i^ the.xx. Chapter of the Revelation / Gog and Magog be
put as Gog and Magog.
for the aids of Antichriste / whom the Jews by vain expectation do look
for to come in the end of the Roman Empire to kyl Messiah the son of
Joseph. And that incontyne^tly they should be oppressed and ouerco^ne by
Messiah the son of David before the walls of Jerusalem. And the same opinion
of the Jews sprongne owte of the holy scriptures and sayings of the oulde
fathers / but not wellvndersta^ded / has not a little busied the minds even of
the Christen men. And saint Augustyne writes against it in the.xx. book
intiteled and named De ciuitate Dei / that is to say / of the cyttye Methodius.
of God. Methodius Bishop and martyr who florysshed about the three hondreth
year of the Lords birth did judge more truly of Gog and Magog and of the other
people of Scythia. He prophesied that these borderers of the mountains of
Caucasus should invade the Christen domynyons not as wholly Antichriste / but as
part of him / A fox opening to the^ the gates and strong enclosed howldes /
the which hitherto did keep them back from anoyance of the Christian people.
And there be which interpret Mahumet to be the same fox / and Gog and Magog
to be the Turks. But hereafter I will show you that a long time before
Mahumet was borne the Christian men were greatly plaged by the Turks / and that
for sin / if that first I shall have fownde owte the signification of the
fox / the which Methodius not with owte the prophecye of the spyrite did make
to be captain to the Caucasiane army. For it is well known that the wit of
a fox is craftye and much spoken of in the proverbs of the common people for
preparynge of his dens and lyuinge / for disceyuinge the howndes / for
eschuynge of snares and soche other things. Where upon for the declaration of
a subtle disceyuinge or false man a fox is mentioned both in holy scripture
and also amongst profane writers. And therefore the lord casts of the
disguysed or counterfeit dyscyple the which for the love of the present
commodite Mat. viii.
had purposed to follow him saying. The foxes have dens and the birds of
heaven nestes / but the son of man has not where he may lay his head. Also
he Luke. xiii
calls Herod the tyra^te instructed with many disceytes a fox. And Ezethiel
Ezee. xiii.
does compare the false Prophets of the Israelytes the which regarded not the
glory of god nor the health of the people but their own private wealth unto
foxes. The spowse also requires the foxes ^ant. ij
to gether with their welpes for to be taken which deuower the byne of the
lord her husband / that is to say those which be false toward god and man
/ as been heretykes and they which exercise the administration of high offices
/ not for any common wealth / but refer all things unto pryuate proffyt /
that they may gather to gether / Riches / Excellency / voluptuous pleasuers /
not regarding the loss of other men / nether yet the hynderance rf the glory
of god. Therefore the Turks being provoked or called owte of the rocks of
Caucasus as by a token given them by the rulars of the Christa^ people which
had a foxisshe wit crafts / falsehed / and manners compounded for to deceuye:
And being led forth as it were by certain grees / steps and pases: they have
clymmed up to a most great dominion / and now they draw nere unto us / by
the sufferance of god which suffers Hypocrytes to reygne Job. 34

from the lords birth Arcadius and Honorius did receive their fathers dominion
/ Theodosius being dead: then whom among Christen princes there was never
none more godly. And the same man for his wisdom / strength and all kind of
virtues is worthy to be conferred or compared unto best princes. For he
considering that he should leave his kinged ome being very great unto so
young me^ / and of so careless and untoward disposition did think that it
should be best for the common wealth to appoynte men whom he had enryched
with many benyfytes and annourned with great honors / being mete also for
those things both for council and stre^gthe / to be most faithful tutors
unto his sons and just administers of the empire. But the benignitye of the
right liberal prince could not correct theyer evil dispositio^s. Nether
could his wytty forecaste / behold the blind corners of theyer unfaithful
minds. Nor his godly providence drive away the plage cominge to the Christen
dominions for contempt of the word of god and all manner their mischeues. For
anon as Theodosius the valyante main taynour of religion and iustitie was
translated to immortalytye and heavenly glory: the three men to whom the right
holy prince had delivered his children and common wealth both to be f(...)fully
used and defended greatly deceived by the dissimulation of the foxes / they
being kyndeled with the fyerbrandes of ambytyon and covetousness / by their
false counsels fraud / deceytes / and manifest violence did inflame the
east party / Tracye Greece / Italye / Germanye / France and Affryk with
deadely wars / and as in times passed the foxes having the fire brondes
tayed unto them the which Sa^son did put into the feldes or lands of Iud. v.
the Palestines did burn up the corn both far and broad: eue^ so these
traitorous rulars not so much sent forth by Theodosius as by the wrath of God
/ whiles they go abowte to usurp the kyngedome unto them selves / by the space
of fyftene years / do destroy and pyllethe Christen dominions both with
inward and owtewarde wars / eue^ until Rome it self was overcome by them
of Bothlande. For Rufinus a French man borne Rufinu^.
whom Theodosius had ordained to be the cheiffe rulare of the court of
Co^sta^tinople / the defense of his son Arcadius and the Easterly empire
being committed unto him: did trayteroufly procure the Gothians to vex
Grekela^de / and he moved the Caucasiane inhabiters to invade Asia with fire
and sword and other calamites the which war does by his own swing bring
with it. And some writers do name those destroyers of Asia Isaures / and some
to be Hunnya^s. Hieronimus Hierom^*
the which being at that time at Bethlee^ was in a manner the noter or marker
of all those calamytyes / and he promising in the Epitaphye of Nepotianus that
he would remember the unlucky chances which men had suffered with in two
years: does rehearse the death of Rufinus / Timasins and Abundantius and the
destruction and wasting of Asia and India by the new and that most crell
enemy / which came from the caucasiane rocks. But the Hunians and Isaures had
now a little before destroyde or spoiled the Roman provinces. And Rufinus his
treason being known was slain at Thessaloma by the soldiers of Archadius
which lately had been the retained warryours and followed the banners of
Theodosius and so received the reward of his treason in the selffe same year
wherein he invaded by his foxysshe wylynes the dominion of rchadius / and
opened the gates to the caucaseane Turks / showed the way unto them and by
his promyses styrred them up to destroy the Christian people. Never thelesse by
this his very vile and unhappy death he has left an example behind him
which the folowers of the same his falsehed may suerly look for / that is to
say / they shall be the portion of foxes and rewarded with Psalm. lxiii
the betrayers of theyer own country / of liberty / Justice / relygion / and
of the church of Christ ower king and savior. But Gildo unto whose trusty
defense Theodosius Gildo.

odosius had ordined to be the Gouernoure of the westerly cowrte and to be the
defender of Honorius and of the Roman kyngedome had by a cruel craftynes the

intent that the Kyngedome being extorted or taken a way by violence from
Honorius by means of the war / he might deliver it to his son Eucherius
the which from his yougth did pretend the destruction of the Christen faith.
Therefore (o you Christen men) mark and prynte diligently in yower mind this
year three hondreth four score and xix in the which Theodosius the right

might be made strong unto them / even as it were with sure bulwarks and

and Gildo yet never thelesse were by and by oppressed. And in the same year
the Caucasean gates were unlocked and set wide open the gates of war the
gates of greateste calamityes. And the turks being called owte of the hydeous
rocks / did begin with owte any certain captain / with owte laws / and with
owte lerninge to spoil and rob through Asia. The same year god showed
fourth his wrath by the heavens and did prycke men forward to amendment of

before hand that Honorius his son should be constitute in the same place
where in he had first wylled Arcadius to be partetaker of the kyngedome: the
son suddenly lost his light Furthermore abowte the death of Valentinianus to
Valentinianus.
whom Theodosius bequethed his son Arcadius by.xxx. days continually a
fyrye dove appeared in the eleme^t. For God which wills not the death of a
sinner but rather that he should be converted and live / does stir men by
wonders and significations of euylles / that in time they should mark
theyerlyfe / how that it does agree or varye from gods commandments / and
that they should consider the nature of god / and the word and the examples
showed agenste incurable sinners / and that thereby they should learn what
should be necessary for them to do / and that they may eschwe the vengeance
to come. For what does it appertain unto me to speak of the heinous
dissemblinges or of the backbytynges of the rulars of the church and of the
most corrupt manners of the Christian people in this time? seeing that the same
may be known by the tenth book of the ecclesiastical historye which is
called tripartyte And also by the wryghtynges of Jerome / Ambrose / Augustyne /
Orosius Chrysostom and other which do often and grievously rebuke the sins
of these times.

Therefore the Turks affairs seem convenient and necestarye for to be towched
here and there as it were by leapes / yea and that brieffely until ower times.
For when the Turks abowte the space of two hondereth years had inuadyd the
scatered regions of the christian men / and after the manner of thieves with owte
dominion / with out learning and laws / with owte any captain and therefore by
an unknown name: when they had (I say) by startes inuadyd prouincyes and
being laden with theyer pray returned home: at the last in the time of
Mauricius the emperor theyer name was known in Mauricius.
Europe and Asia. For Mauricius a man full ungodly holding the empire of
constantinople / a great conte^tion than stirred up amongste the patriarchs of
the church for the primacye / yea and that by John head master of the church
of Constantinople / the Turks / one Bochamus Bochamus.
being theyer captain / passing through the lesser Asia / the town of
Bosphorus being taken did inhabyt them selves in the borderes of Europe / and
that in the sight of them of Constantinople. The which plage except my
Judgment fails me / god did show forth to fear them from this contention of
honors and lordeshyppe and other their wyckednes / and to call the^ back
again to the study of christian god lines. Phocas the emperor the which
Phocas.
had gotten the empire by theft and not done any good thing in it (as some
men say) saving that he suffered the ecclesiastical primacye unto the Bishop
of Rome / did drive again the Turks in to the rocks of theyer natyue
country Arabye at that time bryngeynge forth a greater myscheffe / except that
manners warse then of the heathen were cast away from the christen men's
hertes. For when Heraclius the emperor (Phocas being slain) had obtained
the empire by thette and done many things folyshely / unrighteously / cruelly
and ungodly / and that the bishops of Rome did study with great labor to
establyshe theyer primacye / and did consume the goods of the church upon
unmeasurable or rather mad buyldinges of temples / and every day did
cou^terfayte more things the which should rather bring in superstition then
embrace godlynes / and that the wother bishops did not watch with just
diligence to eradicate or pluck up by the root the oulde errors / as of the
Arrians / nether to withstand the heresies spryngynge up as of the false
doctrine of the Monothelytes Pyrrus and Cyrus.
which Pyrrus and Cyrus being also bishops did sprede abroad: Mahumet did
nourishe and with great study brought forth a pestiferous mo^ster in Arabie.
But for so much as all things be wrowght Rom viii
in to goodness to the^ which love god: at the least way Mahumetes sect
shall bring with it this one good thing / that by comparation it may rebuke
the superstitious decrees of the Romyshe Bishop and his extreme tyranny not
to be suffered * until allmyghty god shall abolysshe them both / with the
spirit of his power / and that the kyngedome of Christ s^all be fresshe and
florysshe / like as the war chaunsynge between Cosdroes Cosdroes
king of the Persians and the emperor Heraclius. Which as it did greatly
further the pretenses or purposes of Mahumet: so browght it great fruit to
rebuke feigned religions and conterfeyted holiness. For Cosdroes the first
Co^queroure of Jerusalem taken and ouerco^me: carried away the Lords cross
to amongst the Persians / and he worshyppeth it being set in a goulde^ throne
with precious ornaments. But in the mean time he denies peace unto Christian
men except that they denyinge him that was crucified would worship the son /
after the manner of the Perlians. And partly i. Corin. i.
he flayeth / partly he keeps vnderby unworthy bondage them: which knowledge
none other wisdom / righteousness / nor power to be set forth by God then
Christ only / and that he was crucified. The same Cosdroes did receive
worshippynges and kissynges of fete whereof the Bishops of Rome do also not
think themself unworthy. This Persiane Turk does drive men by force to his
relygion / and eue^ the same thing does Heraclius the which commands the
Jews and circumcysed people to be drawn will they or will they not to the
baptysme of Christ. And in that matter he is author to the kings of French
men and of Spain. By the which violence the Saracenes being the more
vehemently styrred up for that the more part of them were circumcysed: went
unto Mahumet. For Cosdroes being ouercomne and taken by the treason of his
son Syrach whom Sirach.
being baptized Heraclius did set in the kyngedome of the persians: Mahumet
did move the Arabians unto rebellion / and the nation of the Saracenes being
bownde unto him with new laws and superstition: he did first invade Syria /
and then afterward the persians / agenste whom Heraclius called owte into
Asia a great no^bre of turks to be his helpers / not then desiring health or
aid of the lord God the gyuer of victory from whom he had turned his most
ungodly heart: but sowght it of the Turks being there unto hired and waged
for money. Therefore his council failed him like as it did the Israelytes to
call for the help of the Egyptians and Assirians that he might lead him
selffe and the christen people not only of that time but also their posterite
in to extreme infelicite. For Mahumet and the saracenes being afterward made
rich with the spoils of diverse princes did sprede abroad theyer kyngedome
and superstition very largely throwgh Asia and Africa by years a few less
then an hondereth and.xxx. part of Spain being also taken.

Turks hitherto the worshippers of Images should us sworn to the pleasures off
Mahumet and that they should hold to gether the empire or dominion of those
lands which they had now gotten by wars and for theyer power that they
should defend the Saracenes religion. And from that time forth the Clerenes
of the Turkyshe name did more and more darken the Saracenes name / so that the
kyngedome and superstition is more often named to be the Mahumetanes then the
Saracenes. Wherefore the Saracenes being driven owte of Asia did the more
greuouslye lie upon Spain / Italye / Greece and other provinces toward the
West. After these times when the common wealth of the Greeks by sondrye and
right grievous trobles were divided among them selves and the doctrynes of
relygyon / concerning the procedyng of the holy ghost and of setting up of
Images more vnte^perately then Christian godlynes teaches and requires were
styred up / and that the church held no better estate in the Weste parties by

the Armenians when they Armenia^^

Behold when ye fast / yower lust remains still / for you do no less

thus that yower voice might be herd above. Think ye this fast pleases me
that a man should chasten him selffe for a day and to wrythe his head about

called fasting and a day that pleases the lord? Does not this fasti^ge

thy light break forth as the morning and thy health floryshe right shortly.
Thy ryghteousnes shall go before the and the glory of the lord shall embrace

fasting which is prepostorous and not referred to the law of god: eue^ so
like wise is he dyspleased to se us observe superstitiously days / months /

that by prayer we shall obtain whatsoever we ask? Has not prayer made unto

those prayrs for to begin with all / are to be holden as vain and of none

were accustomed to make their prayers fast by the beds or tabernacles / not
as they supposed of creatures: but as they falsely believed of the immortal
gods and godesses. The Prophets also does vpbrayde the people of God very
grievously for their superstitious worshyppynge of the creatures / and they do
teach the same myscheffe for to be the cause of all infelicite. But if the
same thing do fortune sometimes unto men / that they have required of saints
and creatures: we are tawght in the Christian doctrine that soche manner of
prayers are not the cause wherefore they obtained any manner of good thing: but
an accident or a chance: even as it fortuned in one time that the Christen men
which were hired to play the souldyoures under Marcus Aurelius in Germanye
did Rain given by prayer unto the souldyoures of Marcus Aurelius
ask rain of the living God by Jesus Christ / and the heathen men of war
did likewise ask the same of their false gods. Now were it both a wicked and a
very folysh thing to say that the prayers of the heathen had obtained rain /
whereby the hole army of the Romans was delivered faithful and unfaithful /
and not rather to attribute it to the godly supplicatio^s of the Christianes
and to the great goodness of god which does evermore fullfyll the desire of
them that fear him / hears their Psalm. cxlv
payer and will save them. Moreover those prayers are not effectual which al
though they be powered forth in the sight of the lord of hosts: yet are they
so folysshely dispersed that the wind as it were carries He that will obtain

celestial wisdom. But that the precept of God might have his full strength
in all other things: let him (says he) that lacks wisdom ask it of god
(which gives it to all men abundantly and casts no man in the tethe) and it
shall be James.i.
given him. But let him ask in faith and waver not / for he that dowteth is
like a wave of the sea which is toste of the winds and carried abowte /
therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
Furthermore the prayers of those me^ be frail and of none effect God will not
hear us when we pray for vain things.
which ask vain things and also hurtful or soche things as be contrary
to the will and glory of God / which being best can not but will the best
things / and therefore they be not herd when they pray for those things which
be not worthy either to be asked or else to be received of ower most holy
father that is in heaven. Wherefore Christ the Lord said to his Apostles
desiring that Luke. ^^.
fire falling down from heaven might burn up the town that had shytt them

sayynge. Call upon god with praise and thanks gyuynge / and not with
reprehe^tion / for mhy when thou call upon him to destroy thine enemy /
when thou wylt rejoice of an other man's hurt / and call god unto that
euyle: thou make him partetaker of thy malice. For why thou supposest god for
to be as thou art / wherefore it is said unto the Psalm.l.
in an other place: these things haste thou done and I held my peace. O thou
wicked creature thou doste conjecture that I would be like the. Kyther to
speaks Augustyne. Now therefore ower prayers owght to be made after the rule
of the lords will and we must evermore pray with these exceptions. Thy will
be full filled and not owers / Thy name be sanctified / as Matthew. v^
ower Savior did go before in his words and the universal congregation of
good men did follow after for why the lord knows what things we have need
of and what things be profitable or noisome unto us before we begin to pray.
Nether will he reche a scorpion Luke.ix.

good: when we be not herd. Moreover loche as be cowardely and slowthefull

will not use those means / facultyes and instruments which god has set in
the myddeste of them or else rather given in to theyer hands to remedy the
euylles hanging over their heads: or else to drive away those things that
now opresseth them and to conserve theyer health. Against whom the most
wise and noble man of most famous memory The notable sentence of Marcus Cato.
Marcus Cato has given a memorable and plainly a divine sentence / that the
help of God is not procured with folysshe and vain tryfelynge vows and
prayers: but all things comes luckely to pass by diligent taking head / by
laboryng lust^lye ^d by good council. When thou gyueste over thy selffe to
slowthefullnes and cowardenes: call not upon god / for he is utterly angry and
sore displeased with the. Therefore if we will have ower desyers to be confirmed:
/ If we covet to feel the help and socure of god: we must apply ower selves
with all ower heart unto the common health / we must watch / be circumspecte
and labor very sore and strongly. and as the common proverb does monyshe us
/ with god we must put to ower hand / which unto noble acts requires soche
as be dilligent laborers studious and actyue / and not Idle and slepye lookers
on. The Esopus fab^e o^ the carter praying unto Hercules / who^ the poe^es do
rain to be the God of strength.
fable also of the carter reprehendyth very wisely the cowardenes / and
slowthefullnes of sluggysshe bableynge oratoures / which desired of Hercules
to have his carte stycki^ge fast in the mire to be drawn owte / but answer
was made him that he must lay his shoulders unto the wheles / and provoke his
horses to draw / and so by that means it should easelye begotten out of the
swalowing goulffe: last of all the ears and mind of god does abhor from the
prayers of them the which are wrapped in deadely crimes and does nather from
theyer heart desyer that theyer sins Repenta^^ce must be joined with ower
prayers for the lord stopp^^^ his ^a^^s from ^^sty^ate offenders
might be forgyuen them / nether do they ernestly study to amend theyer
living: which thing the lord god hymselffe has wytnesed with many divine
sentences in the holy scriptures of the which we will only towche a few. In
the first chapter of Salomons Proverbs wisdom and the word of god speaks
to her dispisers: because I have called and ye refused it and have stretched
owte my hand and no man regarded it / but has despised all my counsels and
set my correctyon at naught: therefore shall I also laughe in yower destructyon /
and mock you when that thing that you fear shall Prouer. j.
chance unto you / even when the calamities falls in sondenly like a storm
and yower destruction like a tempest / yea when trouble and heuines comes upon
you. Then shall they call upon me: but I will not hear them. They shall seek
me early: but they shall not find me / and that be cause they hated knowledge
and received not the fear of the lord: but abhorred my council and despised
all my correction. Therefore shall they eat the fruits of theyer own way and
be filled with theyer own inuentio^s. And in the.xxviij. Chapter. He that
turns away his ear from hearing the law: Prouerb^ xxxviij.
his prayer shall be abominable. Again in the.xxi. Who so stopeth his ears
at the cryynge of the poor: he shall cry Pro. xxi.
him selffe and not be herd. Mycheas also says / O hear this ye princes of
the house of Jacob and ye Judges of the house of Israel. Should ye not know
what ware laufull and right? But ye hate the Mithi. ii^^
good and ye love the evil / ye pluck of men's skins and theflesshe from
they ^r* bones / ye choppe the^ in peaces as it were in to a cauldro^ and as
flesh in to a pot Now the time shall come that when they call unto the lord:
he shall not hear the^ / because that through their own Imagynations they have
dealte so wyckedly. The lord also speakth in his Prophet Esaye the first
Chapter sayynge. when you houlde owte yower hands / I will turn mine eyes
from you and thowgh ye make many prayers I will hear no thing at all* for
yower hands are full of blowde. Wasshe you therefore and make you clean / put
away yower evil thowghtes out of my sight / cease from Esaias. ^.
doyinge of evil / learn to do right and apply yower selffes to equity. and
ce. And in the.lviij. of Esaias: God professes him selffe to be very hard and
plainly inexorable unto the wicked as it is evident by Iuexorable / that ca^
not be w^ue and obtained by prayer
these words: Behold the Lords hand is not shortened that it can not help
/ nether is his ear so stopped that it may not hear / but yowre great
offenses has separated you from yower God and yowre sins hydeth his face
from you that he hears you not / for yowre hands are polluted with blood /
and yowre fyngers embrued with unrighteous. etc. Now Saints whyther they be
dead or ^^yne can not prevail by prayer to help the wylful resysters of gods
spryte and truth
that the prayers of saints whyther they be departed from the duties of this
lyffe / or whether they be yet still living in the earth can not put away those
calamytyes which God the ryghteous Judge brings upon the obstynate offenders
and the wylfull sinners against the holy ghost: the only testimonye of John
the Euangelyste in his first epistle does sufficiently declare / where as he
says: there is a sin unto death / for the which say I not that a man
should pray. The Lord also says in the gospel that sin agenst the ^. Joan.
v. Mat. xij.
holy ghost shall nather be forgyue^ in this world nor in the world to come.
But Jeremy declares it more evidently / spea^inge of the saints / which
whiles they were alive obtained very much by their fervent Ier^m. xv
prayers: Though Moses and Samuel stood before me yet have I no heart to this
people: drive them away out of my sight that they may go some unto death /
some to the sword / some to hunger / some into captyuyte: And of the living
saints there is a famylyar example Ieremye the.vij. Pray not thou for this
people / nether give thou thanks nor make intercession for them: for in no
wise I will hear them. Why? seist thou not what they do in the cyttyes of Judah
and in the streets of Jerusalem? And the same thing is also repeted Ieremye
the.xi. Iere. x^
chapter after this manner. It is fownde owte that whole Israel and all the
cyttyzyns of Jerusalem are gone back: They have turned them selves to the
blasphemies of theyer fore fathers which had no lust to hear my words. And a
little after it follows: therefore pray not thou for this people / bid nather
praise nor prayer for them for thowgh they cry unto me in theyer trouble: yet
I will not hear them. and ce. It is a place well set forth and most worthy
for to be looked upon very inwardly / for as much as saint Hierome that
notable doctor of most famous memory interpreting the same not only clerkely
but also plainly says: Of these words we learn that he wastes his labor in
vain which prays for an other man when he is not worthy to receive of god
the thing that is prayed for. And that an other man's righteousness Jerome.
al though it be never so excellent may not defend the iniquite of other men:
it is most plainly expressed the xiiij of Ezechiel: That land which sins
Ez^c. xiiij
against me and goes forth in wickedness: I will stretche owte mine hand upon
it and destroy all the provision of their bread / and send derth upon them
to destroy man and beast in the land. And though these three men Noe / Daniel
/ and Job were among them: yet shall they in theyer righteousness deliver but
theyer own sowles / says the lord of hosts. And a little beneth it is
said: if these three men were in the land as truly as I live (says the lord
god) they shall deliver nether sons nor daughters but only be saved the^
selves. Wherefore it is written Esaias the third: bid the righteous Esaias. iii.
do well for they shall enjoy the fruits of theyer studyes / but woe be to the
ungodly in theyer wickedness for they shall be rewarded after theyer works. And
in Habacuc the second chapter an excellent divine sentence is proponed / and
set forth with the which ower mind may be fortifyed and kept suer even as it
were with an holy anchore in all parells and temptations. He that is
unfaithful his lyffe is not in safegarde within him selffe: (...)cuc. ^^
but the ryghteous shall live by his faith. The Apostles also gives often
warning that every man should be honest in all points and keep a good
conscience having with in them selffe an holy reioy sing / for as much as
every man shall Balat. vi.
bear his own burden in the day of the lord and reap that he has sowed.
For the promise of god made unto Abraham Be. xviij.
that the Sodomytes should not be destroyed if ten righteous men might be
fownde in that cyttye / and like wise in Ieremye the fyfte chapter: Go ye
rownde about Jeremy. v
the ways of Jerusalem and behold and consider and search in the streets
thereof / if ye can find one man that does equal and right or seeks for the
truth / and I shall spare that cyttye: is not so to be taken or understand in
this sense / that god is wounte to spare many wicked and ungracious lyuers for
one or.ij. good men of excellent virtue / for Hieremye and Baruch and Abdemelech
and other most godly men ware at Jerusalem 4 Re. xxv*
/ when it was destroyde of Nabuchodonosor. Also Ionathas which was a man noted
in holy scripture of so mock virtue as no man more was slain to gether with
his cursed father Saul fyghtinge strongly against his enemies the Palestynes
/ which before time being acompanyed (...) xiiij
but with one only man his faithful esquyer or the bearer of his harnes had
overthrown the tents of the said his adversaries / and put them to flight.
But then do godly men resist the wrath Ex^. xxxij
of God / even as did Moses to whom the Lord said: Suffer me that I may
destroy this people: Then do they stand in the gappe of the broken wall /
left that any plage should invade the people: Then do they defend their cyttyes
with strong bulwarks / and make intercession for the people: when they only
represent / not their own syngulare goodness / but How and when good men may
stand with their prayers / between the people and the wrath of God
also the goodness and virtue of the people wyllyng and ready to amend their
living. When they be not accepted only for the^ selffe / but in the name and
stead of all the cyttezyns / and that they may have lybertye in the place of
judgment / in the common counsel / in holy assembles and co^gregatio^s
gathered to gether to speak and say their mind freely of relygyo^ and of
righteousness / and innocencye of living to be renewed. For then there remains
some h(...)e of better amendment and a sign of some virtue / labouringe and
stryuinge to break forth into light / which God will not put owte: but does
socoure it / nouryshe it / and help it / that it may bring forth it self /
and grow up unto rypenes and plentyfull fruit. And it is a thing alienate or
disagreable from the disposition Esaias. xliij Mat. xij.
of Christ owre king that he should break the brosed read / or else quench
the smokynge flax: As on the other side or contrary part Solomon gives
warning in his Proverbs that wicked me Proverb* xxix.

Hes^od^^
the same / which did wryght this verse: Saepe luu^t ciues quicquid peccatur
ab vno That is to say: All the hole cyttezyns do many times suffer for one
man's offense. Not that the judgment of God is against the laws given by
Moses which neither does ascrybe the vngratyous deeds of the father to the
child / nor Ez^. xvi^
the cursed offenses of the child to the father / that the one might be slain
for the others trespass / but for because there is for the most part a
common participatio^ among cyttezyns being partetakers one of an others
iniquite / for that the wicked offenders be not punysshed / nether yet a just
measure set unto the murth^rynge mischeffe of them suddenly inuadynge the
public weal. Wherefore by the rightous judgment of god / for the rauesshynge
of Dina Jacobs daughter not only the Genesis.xxx. iij.
lecherous young man Sichem being the Author of that ungracious act: but also
his father Emmor being to favorable and all the hole cyttye were utterly
destroyed of Leui and Symeo^ / which did cruelly revenge the foul iniurye
done unto theyer sister. The noble cyttye of Troy and all the kingedome of
Priamus Troy was destroyed for the sin of Paris the son of Priamus
was wholly wasted with ten years battle for the mischeffe unpunished of his
son Paris / which had taken away Helene the wiffe of Menelaus his host a
Grecia^ / and king of the Lacedemonyes. When the ambasadoures or messengers of
Dauyd were put to rebuke and spytefully entreated of Hanon the king of the
Amonytes commaundinge the one halffe of ^j. Reg. x.
theyer berdes to be shaven / and theyer garments to be cut in the mydle even
hard by the but tockes of them: not only the cou^cellers of that evil deed
were punished / which had provoked the king thereunto: but the king and all the
people being defiled with the laws of the heathen did suffer horrible
punishment of the most righteous ki^ge Dauyd. The city of Carthage having
spite at the domion Carthage
of the Romans and an obstinate follower of theyer example in laboringe by
conqueste to subdue nations was utterly destroyed and overthrown because that
in time it did not resist the council and furye of theyer Duke Haniball.

the excommunicate things of Hierycho which Judge. vij.

Which things for as much as they be eue^ so (o ye Christen men) what hope
of recouerynge out of the Turks possession owre regyons taken away / or else
to howlde them still that the prouydence of the Lord has left unto us does
there appear either in ower wars and counsels / wisdom / riches / or in the
felowshyppe of godly men / whom I dowte nothing to lie hyd in the Christen
church / and to pray with fervent devotion / that the walls Psalm. li.
of Jerusalem may be buylt again? Or else what hope can we have in the power
and help celestyall / seeing that cruel myscheuous deeds are newlye committed
every day / with monsterous lusts of the flesh / intolerable dysceytes /
inuasyons of thieves and spoylers of contreyes / robberyes / burnynges /
sacrilege? And the Authors of soche euylls be not sowght forth with just
dylygence. And when they be discovered / manyfested and known. They be not
punysshed with dew correction / yea they be garnysshed with most noble names
/ honors / and rewards. They occupye the holy seat of judgment / they be
partetakers of the commmon council / when any thing is said / done / or
treated of the publyke weal / of religyon / of ryghteousnes / and of the
glory of Christ the sauyoure. But those men which study to live in Christ and
to be far away from the disceytes of Antichrist are holden and proscrybed A
things to be lamented of all me^ that have one dropp^ of Christ^ blood in
their bodies.
for enemies of the church and of the publycke weal. They are appointed to be
destroyed with blooddy decrees and the slander of those men which to accuse
them falsely receive for their labor the fourte part of their goods: so that
they have nothing any where in saffe guard / nothing wythowte great perrell
/ in so much that they be constrained to defend their lives / their fame /
and their goods in pryuye corners / and they may live more saffely in the
dens of wild beasts then in the temples of Christianes / and they suppose
verily and not without a cause that it stands them in hand to be more
myserably afraid of the Preistes and pastors of the church then of the
Turks and Tartarians. The contynuall cryinge one with an other of them that be
oppressed / banyshed / driven owte of their contreys / spoiled / noted with
marks of infamye with owte deseruynge / tormented with the boocherly exeqution
of the hangemen in prysons and dongeons: is even now gone up in to the ears of
the lord of Sabbath. Yea even now their lamentable gronynges and most grievous
syghes do occupye the ears of the lord which alone by him selffe considers
Psalm. ix.
theyer pains and sorrows so that the prayers of Hypocrytes cryynge unto him
can not be herd. There stands in the sight of the lord a watterpot filled
with the tears of wydowes / of fatherles childerne of them that be naked / of
oulde men that have lost theyer childeren / of them which are put from theyer
heritage / and are utterly forlorn / of those congregations which being
destitute of faithful flockefeders are destroyde by the bypathes of death.
And it makes that the most merciful eyes of god ower father does not behold
ower miseryes. Many and often times yea even daily do men headed with swords
/ strangeled with halters / drowned with waters / tayed or cheyned to posts /
burnte with fire / and buried quycke: asce^de up to the celestial fellowship
above which makes god sore displeased and angrye with us / and all his
angels and other saints / and also they stir up against us heaven / earth
/ fyers / sees / floodes / wyndes storms / te^pestes / and in conclusion all
the world. For why? It is not the crueltye and tyra^nye of the Turks that
fyghteth against us: but the wrath of god from above is sore kyndeled and
waxes cruel upon us by a cruel people. The Turks bring not in wars upon
us so that ower garrisons of men and con^cell may not turn them away: but god
the Lord of powers and the maker and gowernoure of heaven and earth fyghteth
against us. The hand of god / the plages of god are strycken into us.
Solimanne is only the whyppe with the which the holy and Solyma^ne now
Emperor of the Turks is a scourge sent of God for owre tra^sgression.
ryghteous Lord does beat and scourge us for owre vicious living. He is the
rasoure with the which he has determined to pare us to the quycke. He is the
sword wherewith all the transgressors of Gods laws be slain. He is the fell
and vengeable instrument wherewith we must either be amended / or else be utterly
destroyed. And to hope for an end of those plages being endued with soche
evil manners / soche peruersyte / and soche hardenes of mind as can not
repent: the nature or disposition of god / the thretenynges of god the warkes
of god / and the examples of all times does so greatly forbid it: that it can
not also be right to desyer it. For truly it would grow unto a sure and most
grievous destruction / because that in process of time we should be confirmed
in ower mischeuous deeds and wicked ancient customs and ordinances and in a
lyffe fighting clean contrary with gods precepts. And we should be persuaded
that god were the alower of ower most ungracious acts. Nather should any
thowght or consideration / no not the lest that might be / come in to owre
mind of chaungynge the ways of ower most corrupt living. What proffyt
therefore should the captyued Christianes take of ower victories which by owre
example: would turn the fredome of their bodies delivered from bondage in to
the license and facultye of carnal lust / pleasure and concupiscence? What
proffyt should the Mahumetanes take being ouercomne or losinge the victory
which being wrapped in no less tyranny and more profounde superstitions
should be made the children of helfyer more by doble then they were before?
What Mat. xvi.
should it proffit us to win all the hole world and to loose ower souls*
How much should the knowledge and glory of Christ the king be promoted by
owre vyctories and prosperous fortune (which also makes werye and ouercometh
the hearts of wise men) seeing that under the hand and rod of the lord /
and the wonders of nature also making us a ferde / and that with manifest
significations of grievous calamytyes hanging over owre heads / that I may in
the mean time keep syle^ce of the lords most loving requests / wyllyng us to
the contrary: we led ower lives in soche saffegarde and intemperancye that we
declare not ower selffe any thing at all for to regard the study or exercise
of the Christen doctrine of sincere godlynes / and the devout exercysing of
virtues and innocencye. But yfit were owre mind to be turned to the lord
correctynge us and to come again in to the kings hye way which ledeth unto
felycyte / from the which we have strayed Mat. vij.
very far of upon the right hand and Deuteronomy. ^.
the left hand / and that we were pleased to have the doctrine of Christ the
Lord and of all his Apostles and most holy Prophets the only rule both of
true understanding and also of living well and virtuously / which thing as
it is necessary / so is it also easy / and most sure and worthy for the
Christen profession: we should sone have experience what great dyuersite there
is between a ryghteous man and a wicked / between him that serves God and that
serves him not. For truly God (which has the hearts of kings in his hand /
and may inclyne them which way he list / which also Prou. xxi
turns a man's enemies for to be his friends when he is pleased with his
ways) will ather turn the hearts of the king and people of the Turks unto
the thowghtes and considerations of peace: Or else if they will still continewe
to be wood angry and to rage upon us with theyer wars as they have begu^ne:
the Lord God of hosts shall be upon ower side and he shall give us strong
and coragious hearts / honest and houlesome counsels / untamed or inuyncible
power so that the tents of ower host must be* the pauilio^s of god. And ower
emperor must be god him selffe / in whose sight manlye to dye or else to
overcome shall be all alyke one fayer thing / houlesome and pleasant. And when
the lord shall be with us and shall prosper whatsoever we shall invade or
attempt in his name / (which is a tower of strength before the Psalm. le Pro.
xvii^ Romans vii^
face of owre enemies) who shall stand against us? Of a suretye then shall we
perceive the same thing to chance unto us that the Lords mouth has spoken
long ago: Ye shall go forth / and the Lord shall fight for you: if ye shall
walk in Leu. xxvi
my ordinances and keep my commandments and do them / there shall no sword
go through yowre land / and ye shall chase yower enemies / and they shall fall
before you. And five of you shall chase an houndreth / and an houndreth of you
shall put ten thousand to flight. And yowre enemies shall fall before you upon
the sword / and I will turn unto you. You shall be encreaced / and I will
perform my covenant with you / and I will walk among you / and will be yower
God and ye shall be my people. Also owre victoryes shall be joined together
with the glory of God / with the health of ower brethren which serve a
cruel bondage amongste the Turks / with ower own health and theyers also
which be ower enemies / so that they may complain not for that they be
ouercomne of Christianes: but that fortune had so long envied them the same
felicite / that now at the last they might be ouerco^me of true Christians. Of
whose preservation we ought far away more diligently to think then of their
destruction. And to permyt the chance thereof to the good will of owre
celestial father / which by his unmeasurable mercy has gryfted us / being
unworthy and al to gether alienate from the testame^tes of God into the olyue

tree of the people of God. And is able yea even out of stones to raise up
children to faithful Abraham / and to make of Turks / of Saracenes / of
Tartarians / and Jews / the best Christianes. As it chanced in times past
unto the Gothia^s. Nether is the hand of the Lord any thing shortened or his
word made of John.iii. Luke x. i^^
less strength or the holy gooste (which has lybertye to breathe where he
list) shyt up or tayed shorter that he can not even still at this present day
do the same thing.

Chapt. xvi.
But for because I promised that I would in the third place of this my
consultatio^ tell and declare with what weapons and feats we must fight
against the hosts of the Turks: I will now express with few words and
without the painted eloquence of Rethorike all those reasons which I judge to
be effectual / and best and singular / not only to drive away the power of
owre enemies / and to preserve ower own affairs: but fathermore to enlarge
the lands of the Christian kyngedome by all those regyons owte of the which
the superstytion of Mahumet has cast forth and thrust back by force all
ower vain bragging what so ever it be of the Christen name. But if any man
shall bring any better and more just counsels: I will most gladly obey him.
So much is it away from my purpose that I would wysshe any man for to consent
unto my sentence / oneles every best and most wise man shall know the same to
be joined most nere with the glory of Christ the savior and the proffit of
the publycke weal. And first of all / the pretensed purposes / and goods /
and riches of owre enemies are to be looked upon. Then afterward with what
defenses we owre selffe be armed. And the council of the lord is all way to
be used which that he gives in the gospel of luke all thowghe but for the
cause of an example and in a Lu^. xiii^
parable saying: Which of you willing to build a tower does not first sit
down and con^te the cost / whether he have sufficient to perform it / lest
after he has laid the foundation and is not able to perform it: he may

the Turks or else to attempt some indifferent conditions of peace. But the
Mahumetanes keep battle with the Christian people for.ii. causes / that they
may as wet strive with us for religion as for domion. And in the battle of
religion they be armed with weapons that are of great of fecte and may do very
much with unlearned minds / and the which do not inwardly behoulde the truth
/ but labor obstynately to obtain the victory. For the doctrine of Mahumet
shows a fayer face owtwardely of a great consent with the doctrine of Christ
/ for as much as it does confess one true god and prayseth Christ very
greatelye. And it curses the Iues Christ's adversaries and many other things
does it booste / so that the simple people and soche as take no head and be not
circumspecte do suppose Christ and Mahumet to have been co^panio^s and
fellows confederated / which opinion has addyd great strength unto many
sects and heresies. Moreover a certain exquisite kind or face of holiness and

fortune in victoryes / in riches / and in other temporal things does uphold
and comme^de the religion of Mahumet: where as the Christen church lies in the
duste and appears owtewardely very evil favored / sluttysshe / nedie
oppressed and filled with diverse and much people weak feeble and faint in the
faith / with many ungracious men / and with many traitors. And all her beutye
lies hyd inwardely / that is to say faith / the knowledge of god / holiness and
righteousness by Christ / even as the spouse of god speaks in the balletts of
Salomo^: I am black / but yet am I well favored / eue^ as the bagynges of
Salomo^ and the pauilio^s of Cedar. And it is song in the Psalms that all the

of the kings daughter was set inwardely wrowght about with gowlde and
curious nedle work of diverse colors: And there for unto spiritual battle
the Turks bring sharp and obstinate minds / so that a Turk being a
proselyte is very seldom seen in the Christen church / were as many of us
like false apostatataes (which is a shameful thing and greatly to be
lamented) do forsake owre religion and fall a way unto them. Now partly
through the prescription of their law which commands the^ with wars to
sprede abroad their relygion or else at the least way to make men of a
contrary religion trybutaries unto them / and partly through ambition (which
is a kyns woman to slesshely dispositions / and can keep no measure when the

taking away of one new kingedome / only to be a step or a Greece to
invade other) the Turks also do strive with us for dominion / and they gape
after ower temporal goods / so that we plainly (after the proverb) may
hold as it were the wolue by the ears. For a substancyall and sure peace can
not be between the Christians and the Turks so long as they do observe the
law of Mahumet. Where for to abstain from wars owght not so much to be called
a peace as a breathinge / and a sekyng of some better advantage. And therefore
we must pray vehemently to the Lord owre God that he will wit saffe to open
the eyes of the Turks vnderstondi^ge that they may behold the vanyte of
their superstition and the sure and eternal truth of the Christen relygion.
For why by that means in conclusion an holy / a good / a saffe / an honest
and houlsome co^corde both to them and us might be optayned. Again to keep
battle with the Turks is a thing full of great perrell and of much
difficulty which way so ever we turn us in the world / For why that
dominion of theirs is opened very wide by Asia / Africa / and Europa / and it
is abunda^t with the multitude of me^ and of all other things that war has
need of. And there be leages or bonds of peace made between Solymanne and the
most mighty polytyke rulers of the Christian name (as men say) Which things
how much they help ower enemy and how great oportunities they do bring
unto him / or how much they do hurt ower affayers (I holding my peace) all
me^ do understood. What should I speak of the conscripte and ordinary
multitudes of horse men and footmen and of men pertaining to their ships and
galyes? What of they supplementes or store of artilerye as of bows / gunnes /
harness and of other soche like things in a manner being infinite? What of
theyer arays / vittle / learning / experience / providence / and concord? What
of theyer perseverance / theyer sufferaunce / and observation of dominion? All
which things are better known unto those me^ to whom the knowledge of soche
things belongs / then to me. Nether can they be comprehended at one time in
any consultation / seeing that many times in the former part of the host / in
the battle and even suddenly a good captain must take new counsel. But this
thing owght not to be dissembled that the Turks are ower most cruel enemies
and are best instruct and prepared in all things. And that ower power
against them is very little / weak / feeble and in a manner worthy to be
despised: except ower healpe be looked for in the name of the lord which made
heaven and earth / great / incomparale / inuincyble / and at all times ready
for them that fear the same lord / and hope for health in his mercy.

NOw truly by what means we may get and obtain the same thing and use it
evermore: I will from henseforth tell and delcare / trusting no thing at all
unto mine own wit (which is very small) nether yet upon any syngulare

those stories which unto soche as make dilygent inquisitio^: do many festly
express according to the course of all worlds / what has at any time either
proffited or hurt the church / what god has done and wrowght / and with
what instruments / or else by what means / in the church / either before the
word of god was incarnate or afterward. And if I do conjecture truly: the
lord has warned us with a wondefull token that a sorrowful and bitter
destenye hangs over the church and for what causes / and how and by what
means she may escape it / the fyfte year before the Turks did first muade

he would bring forth any noble warke and provoked men more inwardely to

But lest my oration should wander to far of in the explication of wonders / I
will be co^te^ted with these few before expressed / saying that they prove

might constantly wait for the help of god / doing diligently in the mean

does hurt / at the least way this one sentence of Christ will show and
declare: Every kingdom dyuyded Luke.xl.
with in it selffe must come to desolation. And of that samethynge there be
over many examples written in the familiare hystory of the church: For what

FVrthermore because battle and As me^ have their names o^ ma^lynes / so owgh^
they in their acts to be very manly i^ godly virtue. Dir en^ a virtut^ dicitur.
war is holden and performed most cheifely by men / which as they agree in
name even so in very deed owght they to have fellowship and acquayntan^ce with
virtue. And saying that no thing whether it be lylle or great / may wythowte
virtue be spedely done: therefore is virtue to be required as a thing most
necessary / namely when Christen warfare is taken in hand and openly proclaimed
which craftily is not conceived In time of war / if men ^^uer studied for
god lines and virtue / the behowueth it them most erns^ly to prac^yse them
and bent to invade the dominions of other men but Justly to defend ower own
agenste the violence and tyranny of the Turks: which enemies as they are the
most sharpest old soldyers / excercysed in fresshe and new victories and the
fyercer for that they remember theyer old victories: eue^ so they beying now
any mated with one and whother show and glitering pretense of some feigned
conceived verten / come unto batayl. Nether be houeth it them only to be
garnesshed with virtue which go forth armed agenst the enemies of them that are
called Christians: but also all those which are left at home. For as Marcus
Cicero very Marcus Cicero.
clearly says: Small and weak ar the armours without in the field / except
there be good consell at home. Yea and so is that also of no less truth /
which is commonly said: Feeble / and weak / impotent / and faynte is the help
and strength of weapens / one less both at home and abroad men do ernestly
strive who may be most godly and virtuous to obtain their common health and
salvation. For the praise and flower of vertewe / and honest dealinge (after
the comonaltye be set at peace and quietness) brings forth infinite proffit /
conserueth and increases the private and common felicite of all men nether is
there any other thing that so presently puttethe from us the tempestuouse
storms of batail. And when batayl be giuneth to chance: the^ vertew
endeavors and dilygently labors most that it might be put of / and avoided
with the least loss of men and goods. Nether was there at any time Prince or
people that did get them great glory by batayl which did not set before their
eyes the great study both of religion and vertewe. Which thingethe laws and
the discipline of the Romans co^tinuinge in their te^tes do testify whiles
they so well prospered in all plentuousnes. Also their howses and family did
never so lukely prosper as when the holy city was ernestly given to prayer and
thanks gyuyng unto god and to pacyfie his wrath / whiles yet the hard
soldyers lay watchi^g under their te^tes for the health and sauegarde of the
como^weal. Wherofit comes that in the dream The dre^me of Nobuchodonosor what
it signifies. Da^^. ^^.
of Nabuchodonosor Daui. ij. cha. the Romans are signified by the iron / which
tameth and makes soft all things. But in their feet when it was come to
extremite / and (as ye would say in co^clusio^) the vision showed them to be
myxte with dirt and iron / that is to weyt / that they should partly be myxed
with the old and au^cie^t virtues strength of mind boldness of nature /
actuitie and honest manners of their fore fathers where with they should for a
time sustain the^ selves: and partly with the slymye claye of myrye vices and
all dirtye abhominatio^s / Idolatrye murder / sacrilege / aduoutry / inceste /
perjury / treason / infidelyte / unnatural concupiscence / and insatiable
Sodomiticall mysthese and soche other like / where with at lenght they should
take a fall and be thorwne down from all their glory Christ was borne the
son of god and of Dauyd taking^ up to him the impery and governance of all
the hole world whose kyngedome shall never have end But this owre anointed
Messiah shall raygne the Lord and king even in the mids of his enemies /
and shall defend his own people. And he being carried as it were upon ientle
horses / in his faithful worshyppers breasts bent and given all unto virtue:
shall forthwyth obtain the most fayer and goodly victoryes even unto the
worlds end / when Antichrist shall be all to gether hole destroyed: And they
that have foughten lawfully under the baner of their Emperor Christ shall
receive the everlasting crown of glory / raygninge for ever with the Lord
of glory / having the full fruition of the dyuyne beatitude. But as for them
which by name only are men / and not by virtuous acts / and the which living
heredyd smite fear into all men / and after their death left behind them a
foul stynkyng fame and name for the destruction of so many lands and
slaughter of men: did not wa^te the affectatio^ of virtue ^

Benhadad and Hazael Syria^s / Ha^niball / Herod / Silla / C. Caesar / Attila /
Totila / Damerling Sytha and infinite wother. But and if at any time the people
of god ought to excercyse godliness and practice virtues (as it is at all times
convenient for them so to do) in the perellis of batayl it behooves them most
cheyfely to use them as I shall show it plainly by two testimonies of the
scryptures: For Joel telling before the vengaunce of god which Sennacherib
King of the Assyrians should bring in / teaches all the states and degrees of
the people how that by the ame^dement of their living / by ernestly bendinge
them selves unto vertewe / and by the exercysinge of godlynes they might avoid
the pains and plages now ha^gynge over their heads. Which sermon all beit it
was specially applied unto the time of King Ezechias: yet is the mention of
the coming of Christ wouen therein / that his hole church should not doubt /
but that the same doctrine is pertaining unto her also. Furthermore by two
ceremonies Deu. xxiij. it is taught In their te^tes ought sold^ours to ^^ pure

us what exquysyte holiness is required in the tents of soldyers. And unto the
teremonyes which of the people of the Jews were to be observed until the time
of correction and beterynge in the coming of Christ / there is added an
interpretacyon / which clearly techeth the same thing that must be observed in
every age and all times of the faithful people / for thus he says: when thou
shall go forth agenst thine enemies in to batayl / thou shall keep the from
every evil thing / and a none afther it is written. For thy lord god walks
in the midst of the tents to deliver the / and to deliver thy enemies in to
thy hands / and see that thy tents be kept holy that no filthiness be seen in
them / lest the lord forsake the. What may playnlier? what more expressly

thing Bala^the Number. xxv and.xxxi.

Saracenes and the winning of Siria and other Provinces unto their own

increased every day more and more and the wealth of the Christians decreased.
Nether ar the christians to be feared / as long as by their so great and
greuouse crimes and abominable sins they continue to make god angrye and

and provoke them unto the study of vertewe where by as well ower shame might be
taken away as the blasphemies of Gods name ceased / whiles yet ower ungodly
enymies clatter against us saying / where is their god? wherefore vertwe is very
necessary for Christian war / and their error is not only very gross / but
also the most perniciouse / which would swepe out of tents all beneuole^ce /

through these most best things manly mi^des should be effeminated made weaake
Faith i^ wars necessary
/ and the more Cowardes and to be plain / the men to become all to gether
unapt to batail: without the which said vertews / they are not in any wise
worthey to be called (I will not say Christians) but nether bold men / no nor
yet men / but bestes. For the Apostle also writing unto the Hebrews declares
the strength and power of faith which is expressed by vertewe and might / to
haue^ the dominion in ware. By their faith / says he) they passed through the red see as Heb. x^
through the dry land / in the which see the Egyptyons temptynge and prouinge

the circuyt of seven days. By faith Rahab the Inkeper peryshed not with the
onbeleuers / when she received the spies with peace. And what yet can I say
more? The time will not serve me to tell of Gedeon / Barach / Sampson / Iephthe
Dauyd / Samuel / and of the Prophets which through faith overcame Kyngedoms /
wrought rightwisnes / obtained the promises / stopped the mouths of lions /
quenched the fyercenes of fire / chaced away the edge of the sword / were
made hole of theyer syknes / made strong in batail and subverted the tents of
the aleauntes. That I might therefore most breyfely and plainly diffine what
thing The cause and effect of vertew
vertew is / there apere two things most Chiefly to be considered in it. The
cause which stereth a man to do virtuously / and the effect / accion and
work that is done and browght forth. And as for the cause and form: who can
think him self to she we it beter the^ does gods word. Deu. vi. and Math.

nowne selffe. But God can there no man love / nor yet any man for gods sake
except he knows by faith that there is a god / and what manner a god he is to
them that seek him / so that faith ca^ not be separated from Faith c^^^ot he

love. Wherefore Paul.i. Cor. xiij. After he had declared most high things
adds there unto. If I have not love: it profits me no thing. And in an
other place / what so ever is not of faith, it is sin. Now To. xiiij.
as charity is of god (for God is charity) and he that abides in charity
dwells in i. Ioh. iiij
god / and god in him (Iho^ to witness) even so is faith also the gift of god.
Wherefore there ought no another pare^t of vertewe Virtue wh^t it is.
to be spoken of in man: then god the author of all goodness / which by his
fear and relygyon gryffed in to menes hertes by his plyaunt word and spirit
sanctifiyng: exciteth and stereth us up unto exceeding clear things. Which
thing even the most chief among the heathen acknowleged saying / noman to
be made a noble man without heavenly inspiration and priuey mocio^. And Plato
the best learned Plat^
among the Greeks / shows by the words of Socrates / all the vertewe and
grauite of man to be esteemed of the knowledge of god: and contrary wise his
wyckednes and viciousnes to be measured of the ignorance of god. Also the
accions of vertewe and offices or deeds (as they be commonly called) ar good
works: as when the thing is done which god commands / or that omitted
which he forbids / as when there be no Images made nor live led to nor
worshipped / when parents be honored and when whother things be observed
which are nombred certainly and couprehended breyfly in the.x. Precepts
prescribed of god. In which part all the brightness of vertewe and her wide
fame and fruit is beholden / that the glory of god might be extended / and the
me^ (as well they whose acts ar passing excellent as al whother) might be hol
pen with diverse commodites. Vertewe therefore is the first and chief act of
religion The diff^nition of Sertu.
and the strong power and erneste actyuitie of the beter nature which the
word of god gryffeth in to men's minds / refrayninge man lest he obaye the
affectyons of his deprauid natural disposition / holdinge him from the
flatteringe vain perswasyons of the world and evil suggestions of the devil
/ and thrustinge him forth to apply him self unto the will of god / and with a
certain holy obstinacye and perseverance to ensewe those things which god
commands / to thruste from him and to repel with great dyligence the
things that god forbids. And this godly contencion of relygion / faith and
love / and as (ye would say) the trauelinge and forth bringinge of any noble
and excellent work / is alone by her selffe or as I might so say. A perse A:
Never the less she extends her self in to all the parts of owre lyffe / and

which unto them are adverse and contrary. She is Prudence

She is called Te^perance and Medestye. The which pri^cipall first or cheyfe
kinds of true and honest dealing are divided yet again in to certain
special or inferior parts subject to the same / like as there is a great
plentye and diuersitye of things which are used and ocupyed in the lyffe of
men. And here is to be noted that all things laudable have evermore somewhat
hurtefull and agenste them. In all which things the great ple^tye of the
testimonies both of God and man may suffyce to make declaration / eue^ as do
the examples also of the Saracens and Turks wars yea and of every historye.
By the which it is manifest to se and behold how great wayght or effect
virtue has in battle. But because the most part of the holy scriptures is
occupied in the commaundynge of good offices and works / and seeing that
every man (which by writing or (as they say) with a lively voice shows the
way to live honestly godly and blissedly) does for his power express the
diffinition of virtue Dertu is most necessary in the Christen war far.
and vice: I seem unto my selffe to have done my office and duty very largely
in that I have admonisshed and given warning that virtue is above all things
necessary in the Christen warfare. Unto the which virtue nature has
instructed us meruelously by the laws gryffed in to us by the finger of god /
so that we be not grieved or that it does not yrke us to look upon the rules
how we should live and govern owerselues well by all the parts of ower liffe.
Furthermore as the trwe relygion not feigned / false / and dead (as James.ij.
James calls it) occasion being offered / declares her power and
effectuously works some good work / so that in vain those men may glory
and brag of the As the true religion can not be withowte good works: so are
not all those works good that appear fayer in an owtwarde show.
Christen faith which by theyer virtue and deeds do not express the same: even
so do many with owte any religion at all bring forth works apperynge good in
an owteward glitteringe show and counterfaytynge virtue / / which never the
less do yet obtain theyer own painted bryghtnes for a time / making men to
wonder and meruell at them and yet are they of little or none effect as certain

better. Yea and in some part they represent and give forth the virtue and
strength of the trwe herbs / god dowtles provoking his worshippers unto the
study of the trwe and perfect virtue by the emulation or envy conceived of
the false worshippers / for even the shadows of virtue are of soche valor and
great strength that in deed Sibilla said to Eneas: Sybylla Eneas.
unto virtue there is no way shyt up but that she will luckely overcome all
things be they never so hard and high. Now after concord which like a sure
strong cyttye defends publyke weals / whiles one brother and friend is
helped of an other and after virtue which tameth all things: in the third
place it is conueuient and semely to put the art and science of Chivalry and
war fare / all be it this science may be contained under prudence or polycye.
For as the precepts of Physyk / Rethoryke / and tillage must be te^perated to
the present things by the counsel and judgment of a good artificer: even so
the institution of battle and warfar requires the moderation of polytyke and
prudent Captains. For many engyns and weapens which some time paste were
profitable and used / should now be to none effect. And the subtyle counsels
and crafty engyns in bataile wherewith ancient captayns did dysapoynt and put
their enemies to flight / not used in place and time may sooner destroy then now
save the host. Notwythstandynge yet is the doctrine belongyng to war very
profitable / as the thing it self plainly declares For seurely in every
thing thowgh nature be right good and exercise very proffitable / yet desire
they art and scye^ce to help the^ that man might be perfect in eueryco^di^ion
to do effectuously any excellent deed. Nether shall the soldier be made
excellent with owte some conning informatio^ / al beit a natural aptnes and
disposytion be required / as some land will more ple^tuously bring forth men
apt to betaile / some soil more abundantly corn / some ground metal. etc.
Wherefore in the tents of the Romans / and also at home there were the most
cunning masters of fence or men of arms the which might teach them the art
of fyghtinge or (as they be called) the feats of war When battle was first
to be holden or kept with a multitude of ships called a Navy agenste the
Carthagiue^ses which had been long excercysed upon the waters Neptunus the God
of the sea.
and possessed the sees as the lords thereof: the Romans (which had
neuersayled in the salt foam among the raginge waves of Neptunus dominion)
would never have set one foot owte of Italye agenste their said adversaries
oneles they had first learned the seats and knowledge how to drive on theyer
Gallyes with ores / how to govern the stern / when to stay theyer course /
to attend to the voice of their captain and gouernoure / when to invade their
enemies ships and to do other things which battle requires that is waged
and fowghten upon the waters. Also Pyrrhus king of the Epirotes Pyrrhus.
required for him selffe those souldioures which had learned to obey their
wise captain / for soche men (he said) that with in a few days he would
make them warriors muicte or unable to be overcome. The people of Lydia had
some time the greateste fame of most noble chiuallrie and of most goodly
victoryes* but when they did ons fall away from armor to marchaundise and
other vain crafts: anon after their hole strength waxed faynte and vanisshed
away. And except there were a certain suer manner to exercise battle and the
same also retayuinge great power and strength: surely god had never given to
his people the laws of the styntes in the layinge forth and N^me. if.
measuringe of theyer tents / of the choice and admittynge of soldiers / of
the seigelayinge to cittyes / of the diuidi^ge of the spoils / of the order
and setting for the of the battle / of the forth ecallynge and forespeakinge
of the hos^e / of the signs / ba^ners / cognisances / and soche other things
/ that I may pass over with silence how that many wise men have put the art
and science of warrefare in letters and books / that I may omit the laws
and manners of diverse victoriouse natious in the orderinge of their Tents and
other soche like affairs pertayninge unto war / of whom the histories make
of ten mention. At the last that I may bring forth one example for an
infinite nombre: Did not Abraham the most high / and (as ye would say) the
confederated friend of God and the forestanderd bearer of owre faith: did he
not in that battle (where Genesis xiii^
in but with a little host at one time he scatered and put to flight.iiij. the
most mighty Kings of all Asya after they had slain that most strong
people of Sodom and Gomor) did he not (I say) wisely and expertely declare
the might and power of the dyscyplyne of war / and manyfestly express the
hole observation thereof? Wherefore as holy relygyon persuades the facultyes of
warfare / pollycye and strength both of mind and body to be given of God /
so that for the same we owght for to say with the most victoryose Prophet
David? Praised be the Lord God my king / which instructs Ps. exliii.
my hands unto war / and teaches my fyngers how to keep battle: even so
like wise the laws of god and examples of the most excellent men teach us
not to contemn the doctrine of war / which by the consent of men and the
instruction of nature is also confirmed. Surely these long and many years ago
the manner of orderinge the fore front of the battle has ever been observed
proffitable The order and arape of batayl (...) taken of ^ranes
ly which in the first beginning men affirm and say to have been expressed
and learned of Cranes obseruinge and kepinge with crafty pollycie their
dilligent watch theyer order and array.

But the cheifeste knowledge of that doctrine is busely occupied about the end
of war and battle / wherefor Aurelius Augustine the most noble Doctor of
the church in his tenth question to the book of Iosue says. A just man
owght (...)slyn
theyfely to remember that he take in hand Just battle. Just batayles were
wont to be diffined which did revenge iniuryes / as when any natyon or cyttye
(which was to be required by the force of arms) would either neglecte to
correct the offense committed of their people or else would not render soche
things again as they had by injuries taken away. But that kind of war
without any dowte is iusle and lawful which god do the command. In the
which the captain or the people is not so much to be judged the Author of the
battle as for a minister under god ordined of him to defend his people. But
when a Prince has taken just war in hand: whether he get the victory with
open field or by subtyle traynes and polycies it is no hurt unto justice. Thus
much says he. Wherefore as it is not convenient for Christen men moved with
auaryce or ambytion or of a fiercenes and furye to fight against the Turks /
when they would be at rest: eue^ so good and right reason and godlynes does
command / exhort / and constrayne us to repel enmyous wars either by some
civil communication and honest leage of peace or truce taken: or else with
strong courage and weapons bente even at their faces: so that we being
delivered from the fear of owre enemies (god fyghthyng with ws / or else
rather Luke. ^
for us) might serve him in holiness and ryghteousnes all the days of owre
life. As form / if there were any hope of some honest and sure peace without
blood and without the infinite parels of battayls / I would judge it best
first by counsel rather then by war to te^pte to have peace with the Turks
/ as did the Romans with the Carthaginenses / even whiles Sagunthus their next
city contrary to the trwse taken in the former battayll was destroyed. And
Ezechias labored in all that he could to bye peace iiij. Reg. rviii.
with money of that ungodly Sennacheryb. Theodosyus also took trwse by an oath
with Athalarik King of the Gothians not yet christened / which was unto the
public weal not only honest but also luckly and prosperouse. But and if all
hope of honestye and sure peace be gone / so that there flies abroad nothing
but the fyerce fame of crueltye and preparation of war (and hither to I can
not tell whether ever at any time leages or couenauntes of peace taken with the
Turks / brought more good then evil to the Christianes / of the which thing
now there is no time to dispute) I think it best first that men convert
these minds unto the help of Christ owre King and Sauyoure / and then
afterward to compose / redress and order soche things as be owte of frame
after the prescriptions of Gods word so far forth as the time of truce and
peace taken will permyt and suffer them. And as concerning the resydue of
things left un redressed for the lack of space and time convenient: to make
a faithful promise and a vow unto God to se them reformed at better layser
and oportunitye: which vow and promise made (after all danger removed and
taken away by the help of god) must be performed with a good faith. And
the^ in conclusion they must endeavor them selves with all their heart
stomach and strength to repelle and drive bark the power and tyranny of the
Turks by the example of most holy men. For good reason and nature
constrayneth / the word of god commands the laws cry / relygion dryueth
and co^pelleth / that great iniuryes and contumelious rebukes / be avoided and
thrust far away from ower goodie / from all owre substance and riches /
from ower tenementes and howses / from aged and impotent peeple sone oppressed
with injury and from the woman sere subject to the rauysshement of unchaste
Ruffians / from compled man and wife / from childerne and parents / from ower
co^ntrye / so that strong ^^n owght with all their dilligent power and study to
hold fast liberty / laws / iusticie / honesty / relygion and the worship of
the most high god / with owr other goods which god of his singular goodness
has given us / and wylleth them to be defended by the mutual help of the
Christen societe. And as after that al things being reasoned and rekened
before with good consideration / batayl is to be taken in hand: even so must
it be also faughten constantly. Nether shall it be good or proffitable for men
once broken with labors and contrary chances (as full diverse and many ar the
fortunes of batayl / the lord in the mean ceason teinting the confidence and
faith of his children by slaughter and soche blody plages) to prefer any
peace be fore armor and batyle which thing has brought the greateste
contempt and infinite miserys in to diverse lands cyttyes and kyngdoms. What
suffered? yea what did not the Romans suffer by xxiiij. years / whiles the
first batayl was faughten with the Phenisions otherwise named the
Cartagine^ses? What and how great damage and loss of men and goods sustained
the Romans? But yet at length perseuera^ce had the victory. Who may tell the
difficultes and distresses which the same Romans sustained in the xvii. years
of the.ij. batayl with the same Phenisia^s for throwing down of one of their
co^federated cyttes? And as Ma^lius (...)lius.
says in the storye of Liuius / ever did the Romans fight more strongely then
luckely. A certain cyttye in Phrygya of the Christian name did choose rather to be
throne down to the grownde standinge constantly and honestly in the confession
of Christ / the^ by any foul and theuisshe covenant of peace and truce to
come in to the hands of the tyra^te of Parthia. The.xi. trybes of Israel / to
avenge / the injury of one woman (which tribes were twyse and Iud ^. ^
yet again the third time scatered and put to flight / with the loss of.xl.
thowsande men) did not yet shrynk from their batayl until they had destroyed
the Authors and defenders of that mischeuouse abominable crime. It were to

Therefore unto this warfare it is necessary to seek owte the best tried and
chosen captains. For why (as the most common verse gives waringe) the
strength of the souldioures consists in the pollicye and council of the
captain. Also Leonidas was wont for to say: The herd o^ Leonidas.
Hearts is more to be feared having al^ on unto theyer captain: then an host
o^ Lions having an heart unto theyer captain. And how much it lies in the
Emperor ather to win or to lose the vi^torye (whom the vulgar people call
the supreme or general captain / whether h^ be a king or any other constytute
in the name of a prince) very many historyes do sufficiently teach and
declare. For where ^. Re. xli^.

perfitly a right god Emperowre or captain to be A good captain must be
endued with iiij. things*
endewed with.iiij. things / that is to meit: with Co^ninge and knowledge of
the feats of war / with strenght and vertewe / with Authorite and power /
with felicite and good fortune. For seeing that in the inferior captains
called Centuryons / and in the homely or rude soldyers / Centurious becalled
captains over honderds
wysdom / experience vertewe and strength ought for to be of greateste power:
it is convenient that in the same things that man far excede and excel other
/ upon whose shulders the comonaltye has laid the chief wayght and all the
charge of the batayland warrfare. Furthermore except the soldiers have a
clear good opinion of the wit / wisdom / experience / vertewe and faith of
the Emperor and cheyf ruler over them* how can he with his reasons /
exhortacions and persuasions inflame them to fight / stay them and refrain
them wha^ he list. And to be short / how may he have them priest and redye
unto all chances? But yet here will ^ not omit the fame and name of a good
Emperowre to be of much effect Alexander.
as of Alexander the great whose fame feared and overcame many nations before
they had seen his ba^nere and armours. The felycite and good luke in puttinge
by the hurtes and damages from the host and common weal / and by battle to
procure glad victory with whother commodites / comes of no thing else then of
the favor of god almightye / which doutlesse favors the godly and the
lovers of right deali^ge / but the unjust and wyked he turns away and
thrusts them from him. For even the holy scriptues threate^ to these wyked men
greuouse and sharp calamites / but to the good they promise all that is
fortunate and prosperouse. Wherefore Claudianus writtinge of the most lukkye
war wherbye Theodosius over came Arbogastes and Eugenius in the mountans
called the Alps: sings this song: Claudianus.


O nimium dilecte deo tibi militat ether. Et coniurati veniunt ad classica
venti.

That is to say. Oh derely beloved with god / whom the wether / the aier and
wind helps to fight. And the winds being coniured do pleasantly blow and
come unto thye Nauyes. Examples there be many and plain here and there in the
stories of excellent emperors of which Germany Arminius
had ever great plenty / as Arminius / Oedakker / Chunrades / Othones / with
infynyte other. The which Germanye if ons at the last she would ernestly
consider / and call to her remembrance her auncitours vertew: she should give us
again me^ / which should be praised and celebrated with the wits of good
writers. But yet the most absolute and perfitte example of the highest
emperor is set before ower eyes in Iosue / and so forth in David / and in
Ioab. Also the writer of the books of the Judges delareth the lessons which
every good captain owght for to follow.

Now even reason compels that we ought not to admit every man withowte

men: no notherwyse then ships often times be ouercharged and sonken with to

tried choice of soldiers. The laws of god also in Deuteronomye command not
only the ferefull herttelesse to be removed out of the host: but also such
as Deuteronomy. xx.
are ta^gled with any false religion or evil affection / so that they can not
give them selves wholly unto death for the publyke weal. Wherefore these common
rybaldes whorehonters / dronkerds / and swerers / owght to be cast owte far
from the tents of god / and also soche that for money and spoils will either
fight agenste / or defend every cause how false and unjust so ever it be: of
whom the Poet says.

Nulla fides pietasque virisque castra s^qu^tur There is no faith / There is no
godlynes with these men that follow the tents. Nether ar soche men the apt
and laweful auengers of superstition / whom the threheaded and triple croned
Bishop / is wo^t to make / with whight / blake / and red buskins and boots /
as false traitors were wont to smite and coin false money / but men fearing
god must be chosen which will not forget theier oath made to their captain
and emperor Christ in their baptism and that ^ight vesture or badge of
warfare and erneste penye given them of their godfathers taki^g them up to
teach them Christ's faith / which vesture is given them to this intent that
they should and will unto their last breathe defend the causes and faith of
Christ's church / and not the Romish bishops false causes and Antichriste^
religion. For he that neglects the first pri^cipall oath and Sacrament: how
shall he in so great parell keep his faith and promise with men? For this was
ons the form of the holy oath under the Christen Emperowrs (if any man would
seek it) that The holy oath which the souldioures were wont for to make unto
the emperor.
they should swear by god / Christ / and by the holy Ghost and by the Emperowrs
Majesty (which next unto God owght to be loved and reuerencyed of mankind)
them selves manyfully to do all things which the Emperowr shall commau^de /
never to turn their faces in battayll / nor to refuse death for the Roman (or
to speak more circumspectely) for the Christen common weal. And how great a
treasure it is to have a godly and holy soldyer / it shall be sufficient to show
it by two examples / of which one is in the storye of the kings. When Amasias
king of Judah had hired a thousand of the Israelites ^^. Paral, xxv.
such as worshipped the golden calves to fight agenst the people of Idumia: he
was by the word out of gods mouth commanded to take of their soldiers badges
and send home the legions of the ungodly / unto whom not with standing yet he
had paid their wages before: for thus he said: let not the host of Israel go
forth with the / for god is not with Israel nor with all the sons of Ephraim.
And if thou think the batayl to consist in the strength of the host god
shall cause the to be over comen of thine enemies / for it is goddis power both
to help and to put to flight. The other example is declared in the
ecclesiastical history of Eusebius after this manner: When the host of Marcus
Aurelius was allmoste lost for the lack of drink being diseased with a
grievous Marcus ^urelivs.
thyrste and theyer enemies were even now allmoste upon them so that they
looked for none other but death and thought the^ selves to be utterly undone:
the Christen souldioures kneled down prayinge to god and they optayned both a
plenteouse shower of sweet rain / and that lyghteninge and fire falling down
from heaven destroyed their enemies / where upon it was called of the emperor
the lightening legion. Beside this / the bold mind and disposicion and apt
comelynes of the body must in the chosinge of soldyers be well looked upon: of
the which thing the captayns part is to consider. Moreover what manner a
company whether footmen or horsemen or nauyes by sea / and how great a
quantity and nombre of them must be brought forth: it behoweth to esteem
judge and conjecture of and by the state and substance of theier Enemies / and
of their own power / and riches. For as it should be but a fondnes to lead forth
an host of footmen agenst a nauye: eue^ so to ouercharge the cyttye or
comonaltye with a great host when no Xerxes.

theyer incursion. The Prince of the Danes with a little host trobled the te^tes
of Mahumet when he had taken Constantinople. And the same Mahumet was scatered
and put to flight with a little power of ower Germans. Expert and wise men do
judge and suppose the little nombre or the smalenes of the army greatly to
have hurt ^ewes
and hyndered that battle wherein ^ewes the late king of Hungarye was lost
and stayne. Werfore nether small multitudes are to be contemned nor yet great
hosts to be trusted unto as the ende^ of diverse wars and battayles ha^^
tawght us.

Furthermore of how great wayght and power the disciplyne of war is: it
lyketh me to declare and show it owte of Valerius Maximus. The disciplyne of
war (says he) being sharply kept and retained did bring forth and
procure unto the Romans empire the dominion of Valerius Maxim.
Italye. It made them lords and gave the^ the governance of many cyttyes / of
great kings and of most strong and valiante nations. It opened the Jaws or
the mowthe of the crooked sea bank of the I Will of Pontus. It delivered unto them
the mighty strong howldes of the Alps and of the montayne Taurus being rent
up and overthrown. And it made the said Empire of Rome sprongne owte of the
pore cotage of Romulus / the chief head and rular of all the hole world out
of whose bosom did flow and run (as owte of a spring) all noble chiualrye
and victorious triu^phes. Truly examples are fownde every where what good the
disciplyne of war brings when it is observed and what hurt when it is
neglected. Nether do I dowt but that and if the abominable blasphemies of
soldiers unworthy to be spoken / were repressed and refrayned / and their
beastely surfettyng and dronkenes / and their most illiberall gamening / dysing
/ and carding (which with lifle business and sone might be brought to pass: if
the chief rulers would put it in use and excercyse) we should shortly feel the
excellent benevolence of god. What great matter were if / if these blasphemies

forward. Wherefore among the Greeks also those me^ were lauded for the
whetti^ge or sharpnynge of virtue which either had suffered death for the
publyke weal or else fighting valiantly did bring home the victory.

Now there remains behind to speak of prayers and that most breyfely
which hold the first / the midest / and the last plase / as the noble
Gratour in his facultye well to speak Of holy prayers ^ o^ theyer virtue and
strength in^atayl^
his oration: gives the first / second / and third parts to the accion /
deed or cause. For it be houeth as well al other things as the laborouse
business in batail most full of parells and dificultes to be taken inha^de /
enterprised / and happily to be begun in the name of the god almighty in the
name of god to be faughte^ and done / and for the good success of things: to
give god thanks the Author of the wholl good luk and felycite / nether to
murmr ageuste him if any thing happen contraye to ower mind. For god of his
beneuolent and most wise council sends unto us this same evil luk to monyshe
/ warn / and to correct us / and to make us more ernest to seek and pray for
his help. The godly worshippers of the one only true and lyuinge god had ever
this continual custom / in sharp and perrellous things to fly to the name
of god / and to pray for heavenly help with out the which all the strength
and power of of men mortal is no thing worth. But god being owre sworn
brother in batail and helper / the most weakeste persons do overcome the
mightiest powers of the world. Holy prayers / and the name of the lord (which
unto faithful men's prayers ar affistent / and as Dauyd says: the lord is
ever present with them that call upon him in trwe faith) do obtain the
vyctorye like a tower inexpugnable. For the Ine^pugnable that ca^ not be wo^ne

the lord which both may and will defend his people in their tribulation.
They make good co^cell / strong hearts / bodies impenetrable Impenetrable that

and soche as will shrynke at no labor. They give happy victory and firm /
st^ble / and sure peace. Wherefore the Psalmographe in the.c. vi. Psalm willing
to declare the might / the power and stre^gh^ of holy prayers says: they
called* upon the lord in the time of theyer trobles and he delivered them from
all their myseryes: and again in an other place. I called upon the lord when
I was in troble and he he(...) me etc. Nether has the lords people alone Ps^.
c. xix.
by them selffe perceived this thing to be very true: but the heathen also
has felt and knowleged the power of god to have the victory in battle.
Never the less with theier superstition they corrupted the seades of the
Christen relygion which the lord had sown among them / in so much that they
ordined Jupiter otherwise called Stator and Feretriu^ that is to say the
bystander and the pearebringer and Bellona / Mars / Castor^ Pollux / Minerua /
Victoria / and other false and feigned gods and goddesses to be the presidentes
of theyer wars: unto whom they made theyer prayers and vows / to whom they
instituted theier supplicacions / unto whom they gave hartly theyer oblacions
and sacrifices and thanks for their safegarde / as now does the superstitiuos
ignorance of some Christians attribute the same things to George / M^uryce /
Sebastiane and Barbara / which owght to he given to the one only god the
governor of all things. But how it owght to be convenient as well in tents
as privately at home and in congregatio^s to ask and call for the help of the
one only god most best and greateste: certain Psalm. tecahe us clearly / as
the.xix. xxii^ lix^. lxxxviij. and the example of the people ii. Paral^ xx.
of god when Iosaphat should fight with ten hundred thousand of the Ethiope or
Mores. Tertullia^e also techeth the manner of the chirches prayinge both in the
xxxix. Chap of the book called Apologeticus Tertulli^ne.
and also in the.xxx. ca. by these words. The Christians look up thither
whence the spirit comes / wih their hands spread abroad because they be
harmeles / their heads bare / because they be not ashamed / and in few words
with out any monisher because we pray even from ower hearts allway and
continually for all rulers and kings to have long lyffe / sewer impery / well
defended realms / a strong host / a faithful senatorie or counsel /
obedient subjects / a quiet world / and what so ever the Emperor and men
desire. These things may I not pray for / to / or of any other to be optayned
/ but of him of whom I know my selffe that I shall obtayn^ them. For it is he
that alone gives them / and it is I unto whom he ought to given them / even
his servant which do reverently behold and wait upon him only / unto whom
also I do offere the best and greateste host which he comman^deth me /

to say. Let us fight for ower people / and for the cite of ower lord god

But that every man may have knowledge of what power and virtue prayers be in
wars / and how much they be necessary mete and comely for strong

examples. Whyl^ Moses prayed with his hands spread abroad and lift up: the

glad for soche good men / for that they now slepynge in the lord have
escaped the stormye calamityes and so many myseries of this present world.

Now will I come unto private dignities and yet shall I not speak but of those
things which have been done within these.ij. years. And to set the fortune
of other men a side: it shall be anowgh and sufficient for us to wryght of the
diverse and contrary ends and success of the* iij. late consulls or
magistrates of the christen public weal / well worthy (I warrant Abundantius.
you) for to be promoted unto soche authorite. Abundantius being nedye /
beggarly or fallen in pouertye was banisshed at Bithynye. Ruffinus head was
Ruffinus
borne upon the point of a spear or a darte unto Constantinople / and his
right hand being cut of: it was carried from door to door and holde^ forth to
beg his meat unto the opprobrye and shame of his insaciable covetousness.
Timasius suddenly Timasius
being thrown down as it were headelynge from the most high top ^ degree
of his dignite: thowght him selffe to have escaped because he lives in
shameful myserye with ^wte all glory and worship at Asca. I tell not the
calamityes of men miserable: but the frail state of man's condition. My mind
is of a fraide and I quake by every Joints of me for to remember and to show
forth the falls of ower time. It is but a little more then twenty years a go
that between Constantinople and the mountanes of Italye called Julius Alps:
the blood of the Romans was daily shed forth. The fires and Barbarouse
nations named Gothi / Sarmate / Quadi / Alani / Hunni / ^a^dali / and
Marcomanni did waste / spoil and pluck away violently / Scythia / Thratia /
Macedonia / Dardania / Dacia / Thessalonia / Achaia / Epyrus otherwise called
Albanye / Dalmacia / and all the kingdom of Hungarye with certain parts of
Germanye annexed there unto. And truly I can not nombre how many nations / how
many virgyns of god and gentle fre and noble bodies have been made laughing
stocks unto these beastely cruel destroyers. Bishops have been taken /
Preistes have been slain and the offices and duties of diverse clerks
destroyde / churches cast down flatt to the ground and horses has been
stabled at the altares of Christ / the relics of martyrs were dug up /
shrines robbed / every where wayling and weping with wringing of (...) ces the
Turks have the victory and the Christen army is ouercomne in the plain field
and put to shameful flyghte. And yet (as thowgh all these miserable murders
and grievous slaughters were not sufficient) the civil betayles among owre
selves have almost consumed mo men at home then the sword of owre foreign
enemies has done abroad. Wretched Israelytes were they in the comparyson of
whom Nabuchodosor is called a servant. Unhappy are we which so greatly and
greuouslye displease god that his wrath must with so great indignation be
poured forth upon us by the furious woodnes of these cruel bloodthursty and
barbarous heathen Turks. Ezechias did repent and Esap 37.
an hondereth.lxxx. and five thousand of his enemies the Assirians are in one
night destroyed of one Angel. Iosephat did call upon the name of god singing
ij. Pa. xx.
laud and praise to his divine majesty / and the lord for him so praysynge
did overcome his adversaries immediatlye Moses fawght agenst Amelech not with
Exo. xvii.
sword but with prayer and did obtain the victory. Therefore if we will be
lyfted up to stand fast and sure: let us repent with the Ninevites. Let us
with them be thrown down flat upon the earth and cry for mercy. Ah less
and fie for shame how folysshe is ower mind how prone and redye unto
vnbelelefe? The Romans host some time the ouercomer and lord of all the
world is ouercomen of them / fears them / yea and trembles at the sight of
the^: which yet were never able before this time for co invade the^. Never the
less now if they shall ons but to wche theyer land they reke^ them selves as
dead men. And yet vnderstondenot we these words of the Prophet Esaias. Esai.
(...)
A thousand shall fly one man persuynge them. Nether yet do we cut of the
causes of ower disease that the syknes it selffe also might there withal be
taken a way. So that we might see theyer Arowes by and by for to give place
unto ower darts / their velvet bonets unto ower salletes / and their
cartehorses unto ower Iustynge stedes.

Thus ends The consultacion of Theodorus Bibliander translated qwte of Latin
