A well vvishing to a place of pleasure.
To an excellent new Tune.


SEe the building,
where whilst my mistress lived in,
was pleasures essence,
See how it dro^peth,
And how nakedly it looks
without her presence:
Every creature
That appertains to nature,
^'bout this house living,
Does resemble,
If not dissemble,
due praises giving.
Hark, how the hollow
Winds do blow
and seem to murmur,
in every corner,
for her long absence:
The which does plainly show
The causes why I do now
All this grief and sorrow show.
See the garden,
Where I receiude reward in,
for my true love:
Behold chose places,
Where I receiude those graces,
the Gods might move
The Queen of plenty
With all the fruits are dainty
delights to please.
Flora springing,
Is ever bringing
Dame Venus ease,
Oh see the Arbor where that she
with melting kisses
distilling blisses,
From her true self,
with joy did ravish me.
The pretty Nightingale
did sing melo^iously,
Hail to those Groves,
Where I inioyde those loves
so many days
Let the flowers be springing
And sweet birds ever singing
their Roundelaies,
Many Cupids measures
And cause for true Loves pleasures,
be dancd around,
Let all contentment
For mirths presentment,
this day be found:
And may the grass grow ever green,
where we two lying
have often been trying,
More several ways
then beauties lovely Queen,
When she in bed with Mars
by all the Gods was seen.
An Inconstant Female. With a reward of her disdain in equality.
To the same tune.


Loving mortal,
In love I here exhort all,
in that estate:
Love is wasting,
But everlasting
is women's hate.
Why then live ye,
Or wherefore always give ye
your tears and prayers
To fond woman,
Whose mind, so common,
respect no tears.
Oh be ruld, and be aduis d
by one has seen them,
by one has known them,
by one has found them
And their loves ^o small,
For what must parted be,
To me is naught at all.
Once I loved
But thousand times have proved
a curious Fair
Helenes feature
Bears this coy creature
and Venus hair,
Cupids dandling,
Her tender breasts handling,
betwixt them lies.
Love pursued,
The more I viewed,
love did more rise.
She did feed me with delay,
and swore to have me,
not once to leave me,
but vow d to love me,
With the like respect,
When she another Sweetheart
Better did affect,
Uoid of sorrow,
A patience pure I borrow,
and wait the time:
She neglectfull,
Of some respectfull,
does let me pine.
Love increased,
But could not be released,
the more I sue,
She ungrateful.
To me turns hateful.
false, fair, untrue
Spend (...) love. or time of fears,
I am neglected,
not once respected,
but quite reie^ted,
And can nothing gain,
But false dissembling love,
Or fond to love in vain
Now a Trovlus
I still must live, yet ioylesse
of Cresida:
Loves mistaken,
And I forsaken,
am left for aye:
Fair she fed me,
Until my Daphne fled me,
with swiftest wings,
Fair she proved,
But false she loved
so Sirens sings
But now my Love has proved untrue,
disdaining pity,
to one so witty,
I Will sing this ditty,
Thus the n^ce shall sound,
False-hearted fickle Maids
Are better lost then found.
FINIS.
