The lamentatio^ of the co^mounis of Scotland
QUhat thift, quhat reif, quhat murder, and oppressiou^?
Quhat saikles slauchter, quhat mortal meserie?
Quhat poverty, quhat derth and Tribulatioun?
Dois Ring be Grange all leidis on life may se
The schame is thine, thocht we the sorrow dry
Cursed Nemrod richt of Babilone the chief,
We Commounis all loud vengeance cryis on the
Blaming thy tressoun the cause of all our grief.
We silly pure anis quhair we were wont to gang
With Coillis and Cokillis, with Fische and sickly^e wair,
Upon our bakis als mekill as we micht fang
With mirrie sang all tripping into pairis.
To win our leuing in market at sic Fairis
Now we allace but reuth at rest with theif,
^aue we ane lyart na baid bot all is thairis
Blaming thy tressoun the cause of all our reif.
Na other life we pure men bade of better
Nor with our Naiggis to gane to Edigburgh sone,
With Peittis, with Turuis, and money turse of Hedder,
Ay gat good saill syne lap quhen we had done.
For miriynes, and with the licht of Moan
We wald ga hame but outher ^ray or chase,
Quhair now in sorrow fra dure to dure we clune,
Blaming thy tressoun of all our cair allace.
We Coilzearis, Cadgearis, and Carteris in ane ro^^
Be bludie Wolfis that Grange hes maid to steir,
Our horse is rest, our selfis ar doung but dout
Quhair we did travel we dar not now appeir.
Out of our Ludge we tak of them sic s^ir
Thocht it wald us ten thousand Crownis auance
With morning Prayer we curse them maid this we^^
Blaming thy tressoun the cause of our mischance.
Allace we Chapmen may with Creilmen murne
They silly men that brocht their butter and ^gges
To Edinburgh Croce and did na other turn,
And we agane wald by ane Fraer of Fegges
Both prenis and nedillis and sell t^ land wart Megges
Than micht we travel quhair we dat not this day
Bot lyis at hame, but meit, na drink b^t dregs
Blaming thy tressoun the cause of all our fray.
Quhat wicht on life will not us pure piety?
That wont to bring the woll, the skin, and hyde
To Edinburgh Town in piece and Cheritie,
Fra Selkirk, Hawik, and the partis of C^yde.
Quhair now allace in hoill and boir we ^yde
As wratches werie the Coreno^he we carpe
Dar not keik out for Rebellis that dois ride
Blaming thy tressoun of this our sorrow scharpe.
We Tinklaris, Tailzeouris, we craftismen out of nu^be^
That be our craft had ay ane boneit life,
We wait of nocht bot mekill cair and cummer
Our Joy is turnit in woe and mortal strife.
All our gay garmentis of sindrie fassounis tyfe
We them wedset our bodyis to sustene
Na work ado bot beg bait^ barn and wife
Blaming thy tressoun that causis us complene.
We Merchandis all that with our Merchand pakkis
Did travel ay, fra Town to Town, to Fairis
Thou hes us baneist, thou hes us fleit fra crakkis,
We sit at hame na saill is to our wairis.
Thocht we wald travel thy reiffaris sa us clairis
With reif but reuth, but piety with extortioun
But mirth in meserie they horribill houndis us tairis
Blaming thy tressoun the cause of our oppressioun.
We commounis all with cair we may lament
That had sic piece, sic rest and unity
And now allace ar rugit, reuin and rent
Our steidis ar stowne, our cattle rest trewlie
With weiping wallaway nane may we ^yte bot the

Quhair we afoir did sleip richt quye^lie
Blaming thy tressoun the cause of all our woe.
Bot sen with since ze Cammounis do complene

Scho greit with barn syue gaif the gaist with plan^
Than cryit my bairnis with money zout and zell
Blaming thy tressoun that had thatt Mother slan^
They reuthles Ruffeis but reuth with cruelty

Blaming thy tressoun that causis us bewaill
Sen not but cause we wit the of this wa
With panefull pech, with money grank and grane,
The curse, the wareis, but blys fra top to ta
Lat never thy friend se oucht of the bot schame.
With cursit deith that money man the blame
Lucifer was heich, bot Lord thou threw him down
Sa will he the, thou graceles Grange be Name
Blaming thy tressoun with sorrow but Renown.
O tenefull Tyrane, O Giant mekill but micht,
Of vicious deidis thou art the only Fontane
Quhair fra all vice but vertew springis full richt
As dois the watter out of the Rok or Montane
We pure sall cry with eye hartis fast dontane
To the O God, to scurge this wickit wicht,
In Just exempill to all the world may certane
Blaming thy tressoun the cause of all our plicht.
Had thou been true but tressoun to our Roy
And to his Regent, gaif the that hauld to keip,
As thou did sweir, we had not had this noy
We micht had piece, quhair now in weir we weip.
In woe, but weill, ^ut pleasure in pane sa deip
Be the O Tratour, that Rebellis did r^ssaif
Into that hauid with the thairin to creip
Ha tressoun untrew will gar ane widdie waif.
Now let us all with heart and mind us dres
Both euin and morn, richt law down on our kne,
With hyddeous schout all we both mair and les
For vengeance Just, with rene to fall on the.
O thou O Lord, and God in persoun three
Consume this wratche with Brintstane fire and thu^de^
That persecuitis thy Sanctis with cruelty
Ha tressoun untrue ane tow will schaik in schunder.
Preserve with micht fra slicht of sais defend
Our King good Lord, and als his Regent eik:
Lat never their micht, but richt, with hand ay bend
Have strenth or power them for to hurt or wreik.
We thy pure liegis sall pray and als beseik
To send the grace, lang space in weilfair wend
That we may se the puneis vice but meik
And tressoun all sessoun, with this we make ane en^
FINIS.
