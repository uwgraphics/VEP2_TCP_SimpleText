or Lords Day; And that it is commanded unto us in Gods WORD. WHERE UNTO IS

Imprinted at London, by H. L. for Thomas Man,(...)

The Sum of all, in one Syllogism.
That the Lords day, or Christian Sabbath, is The Lords Day
necessarily to be observed by all Christians to the end of the World.

Whatsoever days observation was in the New Testament Sanctified by
sanctified, and set apart to an holy use: Christ's resurrection.
First, by Christ his triumphant resurrection. Christ's first apparition.
Then, by his first appearing to his gathered Apostles and Disciples, five
times on that same day. Christ's second apparition.
Next, hy his second appearing to his gathered Apostles. Holy Ghost apparition.
Fourthly, by his sending of the Holy Ghost to his Apostles gathered again,
and blessing of their doctrine by conversion of souls. Command ordinance of
postles.
Fifthly, by Apostolical Command, and Constitution, to be observed by
Christian Churches. Christ's commandment.
Sixthly, by Christ's Command, not to be profaned of any faithful Christian.
Practice of postles.
Seventhly, by Apostles solemn practice of preaching, ministering the
Sacraments in the Christian Congregation, and meditation of the Scripture.
Title given the Holy Ghost
Eighthly, by the holy-Ghosts induing it with a notable and peculiar title of
the Lords day. Practice of and the most p^ Churches.
By Apostolical, primitive, and all later reformed Churches general and
continual practice, from thence unto our times. Iudgeme^^ the most so (...) all
and godly l^^ned.
By the judgment of the spiritual and most godly learned Teachers and Writers
of the former and later ages. Effects Gods blessin^*
By the witness of Gods general and continual blessing of the practice
thereof, with peace of conscience, joy of the Holy Ghost, and sensible increase
of knowledge and grace in all sincere Christians, that with soundness prefesse
the Gospel every where. Dislike and ^^^anation by ^e wicked and ^^sound.
And last of all, by the dislike and opposition of the only most wicked of
life, ignorant of mind, or otherwise unsound in judgment and doctrine.] The
Observation of that Day is most necessary, and does tie the Conscience to the
end of the World.

But such is the Observation of the Lords day, or first day of the week; and
so confirmed in every point. Therefore,

The holy Observation of the Lords day or first day of the week, is most
necessary, and does tie the conscience to the end of the World.

The Proposition confirmed.
For the first member: Look Section, 56, 55. For the second, third, fourth,
seventh, and ninth: Look Sect: 61. For the fifth and sixth: Look Sect, 58, 59.
For the eight: Look Sect. 55, 54, 59, 60, 64. For the tenth, eleventh and
twelfth: Look, Sect, 65.

Proofs of the Assumption in the several members.
The 1. There is no question of this point: but that Christ rose on the first
day of the week.

The 2. That Christ appeared 5 times on that first day of the week; which was
the day of his resurrection, and of the Christian Sabbath: first, to Mary
Magdalen. Mark. 16 9. Io. 20. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Secondly, to the woman: Mat.
28, 9, 10, 11. Thirdly, to the two Disciples: Luke 24. 18. Mar. 1^. 13.
Fourthly, to Peter: Luke 24 33. 34. with 1. Cor. 15, 5. Fifthly, to the eleven:
Mark. 16. 14 Excepting Thomas: Io. 20. 24. Wherein our Savior does comfort,
instruct, authorize, and ordain the Ministers of the New Testament, and gives
them power to preach and administer the Sacraments and Discipline. Io. 20. 22.
23. with Mar. 16. 15. 16. Mat. 28. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. This was performed in
the night: partly by Christ's appointment: Matthew. 28. 16. Partly for fear of
the Jews, not daring to assemble by day. Io. 20. 19. The day notwithstanding
sanctified by Christ's five fold appearing; and the Disciples holy meditation
and conference of and with Christ.

The 3. That CHRIST appeared the second time on that day seuen-night
(Con^^^^ing, comforting, instructing, reproouing) appears; Io. 20. 26, 27,
28, 29. Where it is said, after eight days (including and counting the day of
Christ's resurrection for one of the eight, which is that day seuen-night:) as
if he should say the eight day after: by an Hebraisme. The like speech in Luke
2. 21. and 1. 59. Leu. 12. 3. Thus Calvin, Beza, Piscator, Rollock, take it:
and so do the very Papists, Ferus, Iansenius, and Emmanuel Sa. upon these
places.

The 4. That the Apostles met upon this very day (the first day of the week,
on the morning; Act. 2. 15) appears, because they met on the day of Pentecost.
Act. 2. 1. with Leu. 23. 15. 16, called the feast of weeks. Exodus 34. 22.
Which was the morrow after the Sabbath. Leu. 23. 16. 15. This also, the
computation of Weeks between the feast of Easter, and Whitsontide does
prove: For it is called (...): as if one should say, the fiftieth day. Act. 2.
1. because fifty full days, or seven weeks are to pass between the feast
of Easter or Passover (the day after which, Christ rose) and the feast of
Whitsontide or of weeks: Leuit. 23. 15. 16. Exodus 34. 22. on which day the
Apostles now met. For this truth, look the judgment of Augustine, de tempore
ser. 251. Nazianzen apud Baroniu^: Leo Ep. 81. and Council. Constantinopol. 6
Calvin, Beza, Piscator: with the Papists. Bellarmine de cultu sanctoru^: lib.
3. cap. 11. See Emmanuel Sa. annot. in Act. 2. 1. Baronius Tom. 1. ex Nazianzen.

The 5. Look for the confirmation thereof. Sect. 58. 59.
The 6. Look for this, Sect* 64.
The 7. Look for this also: Sect. 60. 61.
The 8. Look for this, Sect. 59. 55. 54. 60. 64.
The 9. For this look Sect. 15. 20. 63. 62.
The 10. Is proved Sect. 15. 20. 34. 52.
The 11. and 12. Is confirmed by palpable experience: and apprehended by him
that either has an eye, or winketh not: Look for these, Sect. 65. and the
four last Sections also.

To the Christian Reader.
MAny matters (Christian Reader) called into question at this day, are offered
to the view of the World; and not a few of them very frivolous and
unprofitable: but there are also matters which doubtless cannot be denied to
be of singular importance for the furtheraunce of our most holy faith and true
Religion. And amongst the waightiest of these, there is almost none of greater
use nor of more necessity to be understood, nor being understood to be more
carefully observed then this which hereafter ensues touching the nature and
quality of the Lords day commonly called Sunday or the Christian Sabbath.
Concerning which, there are diverse, who (not by reason of any difficulty in
this controversy, but) being led with the variable conceit of their own
unsettled minds, do think diversely: and many such there are who do speak and
wright thereof so loosely, yea so profanely, that if their opinions were
embraced among men, there could nothing but Atheism and irreligious behavior
grow up thereby and abound. Sundry of these points this Treatise following
does with great diligence lay open unto thy consideration; and withal sets
down plentifully a true and right resolution of this matter. Namely, that the
first Day of the week (called Sunday, as before said) is in a peculiar regard,
the Lords day, and sanctified to the performing of the solemn worship of GOD,
upon the grounds of Gods Moral or perpetual law in the fourth Commandment
of the Decalogue; And by the special will of Christ establishing it through
his Apostles practice and doctrine to the same purpose, instead of the Jews
Sabbath. Which Assertion certainly, if it were well received and believed,
would make very effectually to the great increase of godliness, and to the
cutting down of much sin and impiety; which even by means of the ignorance
and neglect hereof does every where ouerflowe. The Lord in his good time will
dispell the errors and vanities of ungodly men, and will advance in greater
beauty the kingdom of his son Christ, by dissoluing the works of Satan, and
treading under foot all his malice. In the mean while, it behooves the
servants of God to be vigilant (and nothing slack) in showing forth the
wisdom of Serpents, as well as the simplicity of Doves: That they being wise
in the truth, may cause the same to shine among others in these evil days;
and yet withal in their innocence may find favor not with God alone, but
also with men. Read, try and hold fast that which is good: and the Lord
give thee understanding in all things. Farewell.

PROPOSITIONS tending to prove the necessary observation of the Lords day, or
Christian Sabbath.
1. IN handling of this Question of the Christian Sabbath: I purpose to speak
in order of three things. First of the state of the controversy. Secondly, of
the arguments and reasons for the truth. And last of all, the answer of
objections.

2 There be two different judgments concerning the Sabbath: the one in
extremity, the other in the mean.

3 The judgments, or rather the opinions, standing in extremity are extremely
opposite and contrary: and they are holden by men of such quality, as are
otherwise branded with the note of infamous heresy.

4 The one extreme is of them, who hold: that there ought to be no Sabbath
or difference of days, nor any certain time or day appointed for rest, and
public meetings for Gods service: but to leave it as a matter merely fre^
for every one.

5 They allege for themselves, 1. That the fourth Commandment ^anchius de
oper. redempt. li. 1. ca. 19. fol. 608. Vrsinus Cathech* ^art. 3. ad quaest:
103. fol. ^79 Rogers di^play of ^he Family of love ^n a confession of one of
that sect: ^0.
is merely ceremonial. 2. The Christian liberty: whereby we may, where and
when we list, worship and serve God. And as we are freed from the circumstance
of place: Io. 4. 21. 23. So are we also (say they) freed from the circumstance
of time of serving God. 3. They allege Scriptures: as Colossians, 2. 16.
Galathians, 4. 10. Romans, 14. 6. Matthew, 12. 8.

6 The Authors of this loose opinion are the Family of Lone, says Rogers; and
the Anabaptists, says Vrsinus.

7 These men (says Zanchius) abutuntur Scripturis, abuse Zanch. vbi supra.
fol. 608. 611. Vrsin. vbi supra.
the Scriptures, and conclude from them that which cannot be concluded: Whom he
confutes, as also does Vrsinus.

8 But to pass by this irregular sect, and salt which has lost his savor; I
say with him: Iniquum est and impium aut nullos esse, Zanch. Ibid. fol. ^12.
aut qui sunt, contemnere. It is impious and ungodly, either to have no
certain days of Gods public service, or to contemn those that are
appointed and established. So teach (says he) the Scriptures, the Fathers, and
godly Teachers of our later age: and so does the ancient received and
approved custom and practice in all Churches, of all places, and nations
confirm.

9 The other extremity of opinion, is of those who hold: that the Jewish
Sabbath of the 7. day in the week from the creation, is never to be abolished;
being no less necessary for us to observe now, then it was ever for the Jews.

10 They allege reasons drawn, 1. From the praecedence of the Sabbath before
the law, and before the fall: the Laws of which nature are immutable. 2. From
the perpetuity of the Moral law. 3. and from the large extent thereof
appertayning to all. 4. From the perpetuity of the covenant, Exodus 31. 17. 5.
and of the cause of the law which makes it perpetual: which is the memorial
and meditation of the works of God: which belonges unto the Christians, as
well as to the Jews.

11 These reasons in themselves are good: but, being misapplyed to the
establishment of the Jewish ceremonial Sabbath which was a shaddowe of things
to come, and is abolished: Conatus eorum tanquam pestilentissimus (says
Musculus) Muscul. Loc. c^m* part. 1. fo. 14^
est retundendus: their endeavors as being most pestilent are by all means to
be suppressed; Both because (says he) they obscure the glory of our Savior
by rejecting the Lords day, and bringing Christians as much as in them lies,
under the yoke and slavery of the Mosay call law again.

12 The Authors of this unchristian opinion: are either Jews as Vrsin. Cath.
in praecept. 4. ad quaest 103. fol. 7^7, 76^
Vrsinus says: or Ebion and Cherinthus as Jrenaeu^. l. 1. c 2^
Irenaeus, and Epiphan. here is. 3^
Epiphanius witness: or Sabbatary Christians; as Muscul. loc. part 1. fol.
145. 146. 14^
Musculus and Beza. These. Geneuens. c. ^9.. 15
Beza say: or Anabaptists as Grysaldus Perus^^ Haere^^cor. n^minibus. Titul^
Sabb^tarij.
Grysaldus Perusinus (a Papist) does report; and are confuted by Musculus,
Vrsinus, and Bellar: Tom: ^ li. 3. de cultu san^^ cap. 10
Bellarmine.

13 The judgment standing in the mean, is of such Churches and persons (from
the Apostles age to ours) as withal professing the truth and soundness of the
Christian faith, have in all times and places, without interruption, question
or gainesaying kept holy, and established the Lords day, being the first day of
the week from the Jews Sabbath.

14 And these are either primitive or later: wherein by the way we will
consider of the middle or neuter sort: between the primitive and later: namely
the Papists, and their judgment.

15 The ancient primitive, and orthodoxe Fathers, both Greeks and Latins, do
with one mouth certify us of these sour things touching the Christian

16 The Papists coming between the primitive and later purity (like a nettle
growing between two roses) as they kept (among other things) the letter of Gods
word, the matter of Baptism, and doctrine of the Trinity: so have they done
(as they received from hand to hand in their several times) the time and
doctrine of the Lords day. And yet as every truth that has passed through their
hands in that their general defection from the faith and fore prophesied
Apostasy: So this also of the Christian Sabbath Catech. Romans part ^. in 3.

has pitifully been defiled, like pure water running through a muddy cesterne.

17 For touching the time thereof, they evidently profane it by d horrible
idolatry, will worship, masse-worsh, bread-worsh* Saint-worship, Image Worship;
and other mysteries of their Antichristian hypocrisy. As also by their impious
^ permissions of servile labors, as butchers, bakers, fishings, mending and
repairing bridges, highwaies, Churches, teaching profane Arts and liberal
sciences, Lawyers, studyings, writings, and informing causes even for gain,
fayres and markets: as also their teaching of the lawfulness of vain and
wicked recreations and pastimes, as sword playing, carding, dancing, fiddlers
music even for gain: and almost whatsoever is confirmed by the diverse custom
of every place, or indulgenced to them by the Popes large license.

their corruption. For albeit with one mouth they acknowledge rightly, Cathech.

. And last of all that the observation thereof is, Iuris diuini, pars cultus
diuini; and does tie the conscience: yet all this they affirm; to conclude
here hence their Churches false unlimited authority without the word of God:
and that the observation of this day, neither is Iuris dinini; nor yet does tie
the conscience otherwise, then as it is commanded by the Church: and so by
consequence is but a mere tradition of unwritten verity. For they say it has
no commandment of God, neither Legal nor Apostolical.

19 The latter sort of Orthodoxall Churches and persons are such, as commonly
are termed of the Protestant profession. Who being led by the self same
spirit and word of God, 1. Cor. 13. 12. Phil. 3. 15.

in the most material points consentingly agree, in certain circumstances

21 This harmony of judgment in so many persons of so great excellency and
worth, and that according to the Scriptures in these conclusions, albeit I
gainesay not, but there may be found among the rubble of the ruins of Gods
Image, men of so palpable absurdity and nothingnesse of common sense, that
doubt not to sway against them all: and with one negative to batter their
authority and weighty grounds: yet be that far from every sober mind and
honest heart. Such Ciphers of men do open but a gap, to cast off any thing
never so foundly concluded by the godly learned, to bring in novelties, and to
make an Idol of their own conceits: and thereby manifest unto the world their
poverty of knowledge, of judgment and of conscience: which kind of sickness
argues plain giddiness of head, profaneness of heart, and a schismatic,
private, and praepared spirit to any headless error or braine-sicke haeresie.

22 The points of difference among the godly learned, do stand in three
distinct questions: the one depending on the other: First, whether the keeping
holy of the seventh day, or any one day ofeuery seven, be part of the Moral
law of God, and be perpetually to be observed. Secondly, whether the Lords
day, or first day of the week (called commonly our Sunday) be established
iure diuino: by the will and ordinance of Christ, in stead of the Jewish
Sabbath, and do tie the conscience. Thirdly, whether the Church of God might
have chosen at the first another day, or has yet authority or Christian
liberty to abrogate or alter the Lords day into any other certain or uncertain
day: or whether it be not of necessity to be continued to the end of the
world. Some there be that affirm, and other some deny.

23 The Tenants of either side, for as much as they are both of most reverend
mention, and blessed memory; and yet between an affirmative and negative of
the self same thing there can be but one truth (which we are commanded
diligently to try and follow) I will propose their difference, with as much
sincerity and truth, and dissent from that which seems the weaker, with as much
modesty as I may.

24 And do profess my self in this point of the more strict part: yet with
subjection to the spirits of the Prophets in the Church of God. Being ready to
yield to any man that will refell my reasons and instruct me better: having
(by Gods mercy) learned in modesty to judge of my self and others, and to
follow the truth in love and peace, as in the presence of the judge of all the
world.

25 The ground of my persuasion is the evidence of Truth appearing to my
conscience, being chayned to the judgment of the present Church of England (of
the which body I rejoice I am a member). The which kind of motive is to me of
double force: I say the authority of the visible Church of God, being joined to
the truth: which is no less weighty with, then it is light without the truth
of God. It is contained in the second Tome of Homilyes, the which is mentioned
in the book of Articles.

26 And this mention of the differing judgments of most reverend men, agreeing
in the substance of Religion, is not proposed to set them together by the
ears, or to try the titles of either sides authority (For how should one
escape the note of insolence and pride, and want of humble charity and sober
wisdom): But only to acquaint the Reader with the needful grounds, and
simply to propose this matter, as rather seeking truth then victory or cause of
wrangling.

27 Neither does this difference of judgment praeiudice the doctrine of the
Gospel. For, by the one part, the Jew gets none advantage, seeing they utterly
renounce their legal Ceremonies, strict rest, and seventh day (counting from
the Creation): Neither the Libertine by the other, seeing they make it moral
and perpetual to observe set days, and themselves have always kept the Lords
day holy, counting it impious to profane or break it by contempt or
negligence, until the Church has greater cause to alter it, then the Apostles
had to appoint it, and command it.

28 Nor of this division (or the like) has the deluded Papist any thing to
boast. For if they speak but one half word herein, we will presently
entreat them to keep them on their dung hill; and first pull out the beam
from Bellarmine Bellarm: Tom. 1. lib. 3. cap. 10. d^ cultu sanctorum Tolet:
Instruct sacerdot. li. 4. ca 24. fol. 542. Perkins: proble^ tit. d^^s fest^.
fo. 231. Chemnitius loc: com. ^ars secunda ad 3. praecept. fol 61. 62
and Tolets eye: who sway with Thomas and Caietane against the stream of
Scotus, Soto, Abulensis, and the other Schoolmen, about this very matter of
the Christian Sabbath. So might we deal with them in matters of
controversies; for there are few or none depending between them and us,
wherein they differ not among themselves, and like the four winds blow in
one another face. Ask Bellarmines three Tomes whether I lie or not, and ask
withal where is the Catholic unity they boast of.

29 But you shall observe (about this controversy of the Lords day) the former
sort and company of reverend and godly Writers (for most part) living in the
times next above us, of the more remiss and weaker judgment: and the later,
of the more sincere and strict; God (as it were) rewarding the diligence and
pains of every age, with the revealing of some part of truth: and always
fiery and pearcing wits omitting nothing to oppose or to defend the truth;
which by tha^ means has by degrees been manifested. The which thing as he did
to them in other times before, revealing to the^ sundry truths whereof their
Predecessors never were acquainted (each faithful one professing purely the
holy truth he saw) so dealt he with the primitive Fathers in their several
times, and so (perhaps) will do with them that follow us: so has he done
unto this age of ours: and as he has revealed sundry other truths; so also
this of the Christian Sabbath.

30 The occasion of this difference in the former, was the opposition, that
they bare against the Papists, the maine and only adversaries (in a manner) of
those times: who imposing on the conscience a necessity of all the rabblement
of their superstitious and Idol days, and the like Will-worships and mere
humane Traditions by the Church authority: Our reverend VVriters oppose to them
again the Christian liberty: Calvin: Bullinger: B^^ter. Bre^tius: Chemnitius.
Vrsinus: etc.
by the which liberty (say they) the Apostles and Apostolical Church altered
the Jews Sabbath into the Lords day, by which the present Church may alter it
(on just occasion) into another day: and by which we are freede (say they)
from observation of all days, other then such as serve for necessary service
of GOD, and order in the Church.

31 The later judgment does arise from the opposition of another kind of
Adversary, clean differing from the Papist. I mean the Atheist, Libertine and
carnal Gospeller (inseparable vermin of every established and slourishing
free Church, arising chiefly from the sweat and rankness of plenty and
prosperity, and absence of the Cross): for as the one is choked with the
smoke of superstition, and is prodigious in the number and quality of days
and other Ceremonies; so the other is drowned in profaneness, and break the
cords and bands of God himself asunder, and will not have the Christ of God
to reign over them. From hence, the later writers (abounding in another sense)
press Beza, Iunius, Piscator, Rollock. Fulke, etc.
a necessity of a Christian Sabbath, and so do differ from the former:
Necessity compelling thereunto. For as the Papist blotteth out the 2.
Commandment, and says it is but ceremonial, Catharinus li. de imaginibus:
apud Bellar. tom. 1. li. 2. de imag. cap. 7. Beza: these. Genev. ca. 36.. 15
positive and temporal; even so the carnal Gospeller (straining the bands of
Christian liberty till they be burst) blotteth out the fourth Commandment, and
says it is but ceremonial. Why might not now the Atheist and perjured person
blot out the 1. and 3. and like wise say, they be but ceremonial?

32 And so having unfolded the state of the quaestion; and spoken of these
other needful circumstances: I will proceed to establish the truth of my
persuasion, and then will answer the objections.

33 The first member of the truth, in this controversy, is this: That the
keeping holy unto God, of one day of the 7. of every week, is apart of the
Moral law of God, and by all Christians to be observed to the end of the
world.

34 This proposition is affirmed by Vide annotata ad. 20. Bullinger in Romans 14.
5
Musculus, Martyr, Beza, Iunius, Hemingius, Bucer, Wolphius, Piscator, Rollock,
Fulke, Perkins, Nowell, Babington; and by the Church of England in the 2. Tome
of Homilyes. But is denied by some others; by affirming that the Church may
alter the observation of the seventh day into the number of the 10. or 14. or
any other day, as just occasion is offered.

35 The affirmative is proved by these Reasons. The first Reason: because the
observation of the seventh day, is of the law of Nature, whatsoever is found
in the fourth Commandment appertayning to the law of Nature, as a thing most
godly, most just, and needful for the setting forth of Gods glory, it ought
to be retained and kept 2. Tome of Homil. fol. 2^ Martyr. I. oc. class. 2
sect. 2 Iunius prae^ec^ Genesis 2. v. 3. 63. Musculu Loc. com. part in 4.
praecept. ^ 147.
of all good Christians. But in the fourth Commandment is found the
observation or keeping holy of the seventh day, or one day of the week, as
a thing most godly, just and needful for the setting forth of Gods glory.
Therefore it ought to be retained and kept of all good Christians. This
argues the Church of England: Martyr, Iunius and Musculus.

36 The second argument stands in this: because as there must be a certain
place, so also there must be a certain time for the public exercise of
Religion; without the which (says Bullinger) the external worship cannot be
performed unto Bulling. Dec sermon. 4. fol. 1 Calvin. inst a ca. 8.. 32.
God: but all would run (says Calvin) unto speedy and inevitable ruin and
confusion. Now for desining the proportion of time, who can better proportion
it then God himself? who in the time of man's innocence blessed the 7. day (that
is; did destinate it to his service) and in the Moral law prescribed it to
the jews: who better then the Son of God, Book of H^^ 2. Tome. for 260.
and his inspired Apostles, who did apportionate unto his Church one day of
seven; as 1. Corin. 16. 2* Therefore by this reason it seems, that the
seventh day is perpetually to be observed.

37 The third Reason. Because the observation of the seven day conformeth us
unto the Image of God, of Christ, and his Apostles; who always rested the
seventh day, and kept it holy in that proportion: which in another proportion
Book of H^^ Tom. 2. fol. Calvin. inst ca. 8.. 31. ^^^tyr. loc. 7. cl^^ sect. 2.
destroys Gods holy Image in us in that point. This Image of God is proposed
in the fourth Commandment [For in six days.] Therefore to conform our
selves to the Image of God, we are to keep holy the seventh day: and not to
do it, is to destroy that part of Gods Image in us.

38 The fourth Reason. Because the sanctification of the seventh day,
conformeth us to the Image of Adams holiness in his integrity: to which,
albeit we cannot perfectly attain in this life: yet we are to strive unto it,
because he was Zanchius de eribus creation. part. 3. lib. 1. p. 1 fol. 480.
created to the Image of God, holiness. Therefore to strive unto the Image of
Adams holiness, we are perpetually to observe the 7. day holy unto God * as
Adam did.

39 The fifth Reason. Because the end of the 7. days observation seator in
Ge^^s. 2. 3. Dec^^g: Lect. 29. ^ Heb. 4. 10.
is perpetual, namely to worship God, and to profit in his knowledge.
Therefore the observation of the 7. day must also be perpetual.

40 The sixth Reason. Because the same necessity is unto us, that was to Adam,
the Patriarchs, and the jews, to keep holy a 7. day. The same necessity in
respect of God, who requires of us no less proportion of service, then he did
of them. In respect of Gods Church, the which needs no less proportion
^illinger Decad. Iserm. 4. fol. 5.
of order. In respect of our souls, which need no less proportion of means
to be instructed and sanctified: In respect of the bodies of our selves, our
servants, and our Cattle, that also need no less proportion of rest, then
they. Therefore the 7. days holy rest is of necessity to be observed.

41 The seventh Reason. Because the observation of a longer distance then a 7.
days rest, would prove injurious to our selves: our souls: our bodies: the
souls and bodies of our servants: and the bodies of our cattle. For seeing God
has given such a portion and proportion of time to us and ours to serve God,
and be profited in soul and body: as it was Gods double mercy to grant it, so
it would be a double cruelty to with hold it, or deprive us of it.

42 The eight Reason. Because it derogateth from the wisdom of God, of Christ,
and his inspired Apostles: who proportionating so much time unto our rest, so
much unto Gods special and public service, and so much even to the laboring
servant and drudging beast, as knowing what was fi^test for every one; it being
measured out by Gods own indulgence according to their strength: If the Church
should break this proportion, and alter it to the 10. or 14. it could not but
commit much error, both in crossing of Gods heavenly and most perfect wisdom
and appointment, as also in breaking of the due proportion.

43 The ninth Reason. Because we may not profane that day which God sanctified;
for so should we turn that day into a curse which God has blessed: But God
sanctified and blessed the 7. day, both in the law of Nature, and Moral law;
both before the Ceremonial law, and out of it also. Now it is in his only
power to abrogate the observation of the seventh day, that sanctified it: but
God never abrogated the 7. days observation. Therefore we are perpetually to
sanctify the seventh day.

44 The tenth Reason. Because the fourth Commandment of sanctifying one day
of 7. is not Ceremonial, but Moral and perpetual: which Christ destroyed
not. Mat. 5. 17 which the Apostles established. Rom 3. 31. This point is proved
by 6. Reasons.

45 First: whatsoever Law was peculiarly written with the singer of God, and
that in stone: and that two several times immediately delivered by God as no
other laws Judicial or Ceremonial were, and even put into the Ark of God
with the other 9. Commandments: (these circumstances implying their
permanencie even under the Gospel, and the denial of any power but Gods to
blot them out) is as perpetual as other Laws so written and reserved: But, so
was the fourth Commandment written and reserved; no Ceremonial or Judicial
being so. Therefore the fourth Commandment is as permanent as the other nine.

46 Second: That law, that was established before Christ was promised or
needed to be promised, cannot be Ceremonial or have reference to Christ to
come. But the observation of the 7. day was established before Christ was
promised: Therefore the observation of the seventh day is not Ceremonial: but
of the law of Nature, Moral and perpetual.

47 Third: It implies a plain absurdity, to think that the wisdom of God
should write, in two Tables of stone, 9. moral laws, and but one ceremonial.
Therefore to take away this absurdity, we must conclude it to be uniform with
the rest, and moral as the rest.

48 Fourth: The moral law is Gods constant and perpetual Covenant and
direction of good works. The perpetual Covenant of God was written in 2.
Tables, and consisted of 10. words, Exo. 35. 28. Deuteronomy. 4. 13. But if the Church
should take away one of the 10. there would be left but 9. and so one of the
words of God, and law of the perpetual Covenant and direction of good works
would be abolished.

49 Fifth: From the Reasons of the observation mentioned in the 4. Commandment.
For albeit there are sundry reasons in other places which God gives as proper
to the Jews, wherefore they should observe the Sabbath, (as 1. their
deliverance from the slavery of Egypt, Deu. 5. 15. 2. that it was a sign that
the Lord sanctified them and was their God: and therefore it is called a sign
to you and your generations. Exo. 31. 13. Ezec. 20. 12. 20.) Yet in the 4.
Commandemen^, he gives reasons only common to us as well as unto them. Exodus
20. 11. As namely, 1. conformity to Gods Image; which is no less proper to
us. then to the Jew. 2. Memorial of Gods creation; for which benefit the
Patriarchs before and the christians since are no less bound to be thankful
unto God, then was the Jew. 3. Rest, of our selves, our servants and our
Cattle; a common necessity to us, as it was to them. Therefore this
Commandment seems moral and given unto us as well as to the Jew. And seeing
the Reasons of this 4. Commandment do urge us as well as the Reasons of the 2.
3. and 5. commandments, why should not this commandment tie us to the
observation of it, as well as the other? and why not Christians as well as
Jews?

50 To which, I will add the circumstances notable in this Commandment above
all others. 1. That there is no Commandment, except the 2. (as our reverend
Master Greenham notes) in words larger, or in reasons fuller then this of the
Sabbath. Which two Commandments the Lord did know would most of all be
withstood, as being most contrary to the wisdom of the flesh: the one
opposed by excessive superstition, the other by immoderate profaneness. 2. The
precepts of the fourth Commandment are both affirmative and negative: which
in the other are only affirmative or negative. 3. There is praefixed a Memento
(remember) Exodus 20. 8. which note is not praefixed to the other: and is a note
(as Calvin, Musculus, Zanchius and others teach) of especial observance,
requiring more then ordinary attention and heedfulnesse of practice. 4. No such
particulars, or so many as in this one: 1. of the persons to observe it [Thou;
thy son, and daughter: Man and maide-seruant: cattle and stranger.] 2. of
the reasons: God has given us six days. It is the Sabbath of the Lord, thy
God. The Lord in six days made the world, and rested the seventh. The Lord
hallowed the seventh day. 3. Of the works: one negative, excluding all. [Thou
shall do no manner of work.] one affirmative, excepting the works of the
Sabbath. [Keepe it holy.] The which circumstances, seeing they were set down
and made obseruable and notable to us by the unspeakable wisdom of God, and
placed in the center (as it were) of the other 9. moral Commandments:
undoubtedly the Lord would never so vehemently have persuaded flesh and blood
to this, by so many circumstances above al other, had it bin only ceremonial,
and not also moral. And so much of the first question.

51 The 2. question of this controversy is this: Whether the Lords day or
first day of the week (called commonly our Sunday, though with a note of
dislike by the Beza annot. ad 1. Cor. 16. 1. Fulke: in Rhem. Test. ad Apoc. 1.
10. Willet Synops. controu. 9 quaest. 8. part. 2. error. 72. f. 435.
godly learned) be established iure diuino, by the will and ordinance of
Christ, in the stead of the Jewish Sabbath, and do tie the conscience?

52 This quaestion is affirmed by Beza, Iunius, Piscator, Rollock, Hooper,
Fulke, Perkins, and the book of Homilyes and Locis supra citatis.
others: But is denied by some others.

53 The Papists also are at odds about this very point. For Tolet. Instruct.

Scotus, Perkins. problem: Tit. dies Festi. fol. 231.

Felisius, Bellarm. Tom. 1. de cultu sanctorum. li. 3. ca. 19
Soto, Lyranus, Abolensis: and generally all the Chemnitius Loc. com. part
secunda ad praecept. 3. fol. 61. a. b.
Schoolmen do affirm it: But the Rhemists do utterly deny it. And Tolet and
Bellarmine, do pitifully fall upon the Schoolemens bones, and utterly defy
that sentence.

54 But the affirmative, which I have vndertake^ here to defend, is confirmed
by the following Reasons. The 1. Reason. Because Mat. 12. 8. Christ is called
the Lord of the Sabboath: the word is called (...). In the word is to be noted.
1. Command, and 2. Propriety: and therefore Revel. 1. 10. it is called (...).
the Lords day: as being Lord (that is the Owner and Commander) of that day.
Now, in that Christ is the Lord, that is the Commander; I conclude, Christ
therefore commanded and ordained it: or at least in that Christ is the Lord,
that is the owner of it, thus I argue: Therefore it must be consecrated to
Christ his service. Wherefore, as when God the Father was Lord of the Sabbath,
there was a Sabbath necessarily kept unto that Lord of the Sabbath: and so
the Commandments, Exodus 20. 8. Esa. 58. 13. did tie the conscience: So also
when the Son of God is Lord of the Sabbath: there must of necessity be a
Sabbath day sanctified, and those moral commandments do no less belong to
Christ, and tie the conscience of the Christian in the new Testament; then
they belonged to God the Father, and tied the conscience of the Jew in the
old Testament.

55 The second Reason. From the Image of God which is in Christ, Io. 5. 1^.
Whatsoever things the Father does, the same things does the Son also: But the
Father sanctifies a day unto the glory of his work of the Worlds creation.
Therefore the Son does also sanctify a day unto the glory of his work of
the Worlds renouation. Again, Heb. 4. 10. Christ ceased from his works, as
well as God the Father did from his. Therefore Christ is to have his Sabbath
or rest sanctified, as well as God the Father. Again, Io. 5. 23. All men
should honor the Son of God, as they honor the Father: But all men honor
the Father with a day of holy rest and worship (in the old Testament) and it
was a special part of his honor. Therefore all men must honor the Son of
God, with a day of holy rest and worship (in the new Testament). Christ
therefore being honored by having ascribed to him the Word, Coloss. 3. 16.
Sacraments, Acts. 8. 16. and 10. 48. and 19. 5. 1. Cor. 11. 24. 25. 26. Prayer,
Io. 16. 23. Ministry, 1. Cor. 4. 1. Why not also with the Sabbath or day of
holy rest? seeing he ascribes it to himself. Matthew. 12. 8. And, as Christ is
called the Lord. Io. 20. 18. 25. 28. and 21 7. 15. 16. 1. Cor. 11. 23. and the
phrases are proper that run after this tenor: the Lords Table. 1. Cor. 10.
21. The Lords Supper. 1. Cor. 11. 20. The Lords Cup. 1. Cor. 10. The Lords
body. 1. Cor. 11. 27. 29. The Lords death. 1. Cor. 11. 26: So it is not vainly
but most properly said. The Lords day. Reu. 1. 10. as properly ascribing it to
Christ the Lord of Lords.

56 The third Reason: A Matori. If the rest of God the Father were the cause of
sanctifying of a day: It follows that where a greater and more excellent rest
is, there must of necessity follow a more ample sanctification. But the rest
of the Son of God is a greater and more excellent, by how much the work of
Redemption is greater and more excellent then the work of creation: Therefore
the rest of Christ from his work is the cause of a more ample sanctification
of the day of his rest or Resurrection, which is our Lords day, Apoc. 1. 10.
Again, If there be the same cause and reason of sanctifying that day, on which
our Savior Christ accomplished our Redemption and restitution of the World, as
there was of sanctifying the day in which the Lord rested from the creation
of the World: then a day in memorial of the later ought as necessarily to be
observed and sanctified, as the day was in memorial of the former. But the same
cause or reason remains (whether we respect the rest of Christ, as well as
the rest of the Father. Heb. 4. 10. Or whether we respect the glory of Christ,
as well as the glory of the Father: Io. 5. 23.). Therefore the day of Christ his
rest or resurrection (which is our Lords day) is no less necessarily by us to
be observed then the former Sabbath of the Jews. Briefly thus: If the very
rest of God the Father be alleged as sufficient * Io. 15. 15. and 16. 13 and
14. 26. Act. 20. 20. Vide supra.. ^0 Number. 4. Hooper on the 4. Com. fol. ^5.
Piscat^r in Genes. 2. 3. fol. 52.
cause to ty the Jews conscience to the sanctifying of the Jewish Sabbath:
Then the very rest of Christ may be alleged as a just cause, to tie the
Christians conscience to the sanctifying of the Christian Sabbath: but the
former is true, as Exodus 20. 11. Therefore the later is also true.

57 The fourth Reason. The Apostle^ ordinances, commandments and constitutions
are the commandments of Christ: Act. 15, 24. 28. 29. 1. Cor. 14. 37. and 7.
17. and 11. 16. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 6. 7. Luke 10. 16. For (besides) the Apostles in
matter of Gods service were led by the holy Ghost into all truth, and could
not err. But the Jewish Sabbath (in practice) was altered, and the first day
of the week established and ordained for the Christian Sabbath, by the
ordinance, constitution, and commandment of the inspired Apostles. 1. Cor. 16.
1. 2. As I have ordained, so do you: which words, say BB. Hooper and Piscator,
do plainly imply a commandment: as the words, I have ordained, do imply an
Apostolical ordinance. Therefore the Christian Sabbath or first day of the
week was (in practice) ordained and commanded by Jesus Christ himself.

58 The fifth Reason: Is drawn from the evidence of scriptures plainly
declaring that the Lords day was both ordained and practiced by the Apostles
and Apostolical Churches (to whose examples our Churches and Christians are
and ought in all godliness to be co^formed). The places are Chrysostom, ^ed^,

reason is; Therefore the observation of the Lords day is no Tradition or
unwritten verity, or doubtful ordinance, but has clear ground and warrant of
the word, and so does tie the conscience. So also do the duties and
circumstances that out of these places may clearly be concluded. As namely,
1. That it was named, by an inspired Apostle, the Lords day; which is as much
to say, as the Christian Sabbath. Reu. 1. 10. 2. It was ordained also and
established by an inspired Apostle, not lightly, vainly, or erroniously, but
co^mandingly with Apostolical authority. 1. Cor. 16. 1. 2. 3. It was the first
day of the week. Act. 20. 7. 1. Cor. 16. 1. 2. 4. This assembly was weekly. 1.
Cor. 16. 1. 2. 5. It was usual to other places and times: viz. the Churches of
Corinth and Galatia 1. Cor. 16. 1. 2. of Troas. Act. 20. 7. of Pathmos where
John was: (and that above 40. years after, Reu. 1. 10.) 6. That day the word
preached: the Sacraments administered and Prayer. Act. 20. 7. and 10. 16. 7.
That day the works of mercy and collections for the poor. Act. 20. 10. 12. 1.
Cor. 16. 1. 2. 8. That day they rested from the ordinary labors of their
calling. 1. Cor. 16. 1. 2.

59 The sixth Reason. Is drawn from the enumeration of circumstances notably
falling out, (yet not in vain, but to some necessary purpose; nor yet by
chance but by Gods singular providence and appointment, as may appear by the
greatness of the works) upon this day. 1. The resurrection and Rest of Christ
upon this day. Luke 24. 6. Heb. 4. 10. 2. Christ his first apparition to his
Disciples upon this day. Io. 20. 19. 3. Christ his second apparition to them
that same day seuen-night. Io. 20. 26. 4. The holy Ghosts apparition to them on
that day. Act. 2. 1. 2. 5. The Apostles teaching and ministering the Sacraments
on the same day. Act. 20. 7. 6. The Apostle John his inspiration and revelation
that same day. Reu. 1. 10. (I omit the collections of the Augustine de tempore,
ser. 251 Leo Epist. 81. ad Dioscor: Council. generale 6. sine Constantinop. 6.
can. 8. Vide Bellarm. Tom. 1. lib. 3. cap. 11. de cultu sanctor.
Fathers, as that this very day is the first day of the worlds, the Angels, and
elements, and lights creation: the first of Manna falling in the wilderness,
the day of Christ's nativity and baptism; of the stars appearing at Bethlehem
to the wisemen: of Christ's feeding 5000. persons, and the like. And from hence
we may observe the practice of the Sabbath by the Apostles which has
cohaerence with these circumstances: To show unto us partly the probability
that Christ did sanctify the 1. day of the week himself: and partly that it
was his ordinance and will, that that very day should be sanctified by
Christians. For, 1. when the Apostles, on this day, were gathered together for
fear of the Jews, Io. 20. 19. Christ then appeared unto them. Why so?
Doubtless at that time above all others, to train the^ up in the sanctifying
of the new Christian Sabbath day; and therefore also on this very day does he
inspire them and indue them with the holy Ghost. And note the word, (...)
coacti, Gathered together; which implies a Church assembly: for it is a word of
Ecclesiastical use and so applied, Act. 20. 8. and 4. 31. and 11. 26. and 13.
44. and 14. 27 and 15. 6. 30. 1. Cor. 5. 4. The Primitive is (...) From thence
(...) and (...) 2. The Apostles second gathering together is performed on this
day, the day seauen-night after, Io. 20. 26. And then also Christ appears to
them; and then is Thomas confirmed in the faith. Why the Apostles gathered? Why
Christ appearing unto them? Why upon that day? but that they had learned of
Christ to meet upon that day to sanctify it unto Christ: and that Christ might
begin to verefie his promise. Matthew. 18. 20 3. The Apostles third gathering
together, and they all in one place with one accord, which was that day seven
weeks, Act. 2. 1. 2. after Christ's ascension, and then the promise of the holy
Ghost came upon them. Acts, 1. 4. Then Peter preaches, and the Jews are
assembled and converted. Why assembled? Why on that day? Why the holy Ghost?
Why Preaching? why Conversion? why the promise of Christ accomplished, all on
that day? but still to declare the will and ordinance of Christ in sanctifying
and blessing this day unto his Church. 4. The Apostle Paul's fourth gathering
of the Christian Gentiles Church at Troas. And there he preached and
administered the Sacrament, and cured Eutichus (a work of mercy) Act. 20. 7.
10. Here note, Paul tarried there seven days in all, verse. 6. That is, he
tarryed five days, and on the sixth day of his abiding there he preached, and
ministered the Sacrament, and on the next day departed. ver. 11. Now why is not
the public meeting with preaching and Sacraments administering which are
Sabbath days works performed till the first day of the week? Why not on any
of the former? Why on the last of his abiding there? And then lastly, why is
the first day of the week so precisely mentioned by the holy Ghost? Doubtless
it was the Christian Sabbath: else all this circumstance had been in vain
expressed and set down. 5. The Apostle Paul. 1. Corin. 16. 1. 2. ordayneth
weekly gatherings: but why in diverse Churches? why weekly? why the first day of
the week, named again? why then a work of mercy? Doubtless all this was
not in vain: it was the Christian Sabbath. 6. Lastly, the holy Ghost
appears once again: to whom? to an inspired Apostle. Reu. 1. 10. But why? to
enable him unto a sanctified work, most profitable to the Church, most fit for
an Apostle, and most glorious to God: but why upon this day? and why does he so
definitely and significantly term this day even the Lords day? Forsooth, all
these things are directly fitted to the Christian Sabbath: established by the
will and ordinance of Christ, commanded and practiced by the Apostles, and
continued to the days of John the Penner of the Revelation.

60 The seventh Reason: Drawn from the bare example of the Apostles,
admitting there were no Commandment for it at all; who being men. 1.
peculiarly inspired with the spirit of God. 2. and set apart by Christ to plant
and establish the Church in the new Testament: as Moses was by God the Father
in the old Testament. 3. and therefore were in forty days space instructed by
Christ. Act. 1. 3. in matter belonging to the Church or kingdom of God; like
as Moses was forty days with God upon the mount, Deuteronomy. 9. 11. As the Apostles
therefore must needs be praesumed to be as faithful as Moses in all the house
of God: so could they no more err in religious matter appertayning or tending
to Gods worship then Moses did. And therefore as the Apostles constitutions
which are called Commandments of the Lord, Act. 15. 28. must needs tie the
conscience. So their very practice and example in matters religious moral,
ministerial, directly tending to Gods public worship and solemn service,
whose reason also implies a contynuance of practice (wherein they could nor
err no more then in their constitutions and commandments) does tie the
conscience no less: and so we see the Apostle gives such direction and
command, as if his example were as current and authenticke as his own personal
command. 1. Cor. 11. 1. 23. Phil. 3. 17. and 4. 9. Even as his commandments
were of equal force with the commandments of Christ. So likewise we see the
argument drawn from example of inspired and godly persons is forcible: as Io.
26. 19. Ma. 12. 3. 4. 5. Wherefore if the place. 1. Cor. 16. 1. 2 were no
commandment tying or concerning us, or if the 4th Commandment of the moral
decalogue did not perpetually command the keeping holy of a 7. day: Yet the
bare example of the Apostles and their practice of keeping holy the first day
of the week, being a moral duty tending to Gods worship, and the reason
thereof, implying continuance, does tie our conscience, and is as a necessary
and sufficient rule for us to walk by, to the end of the world.

61 The eight Reason: Is drawn from the circumstance of time: namely the
continuance of it from the Apostles times to our time: Beginning 1. At Christ
his twofold apparition on that day: and so proceeding. 2. to the holy Ghosts
desce^sion on the Apostles on that day. 3. Then to the Apostles practice at
Troas on that day: 4. From thence to the Corinthian and Galathian constitution
and command. 5. From thence forty years after and above, as the Codoman.

learned judge) to John the inspired Penner of the Revelation his Testimony and
mention of that day. 6. Then down into the Ocean of the Fathers and Councels,
witnessing thereof in their several succeeding ages Greeks and Latins.
Ignatius, Justinius Martyr, Irenaeus, Origin, Tertullian, Basil, Athanasius,
Chrysostom, Hierome, Ambrose, Augustine: and the rest before cyted. Thesis,
15. Together with the Papists testimonies for their times, unto the practice of
the times wherein we live. From whence I argue thus: That custom tending to
Gods public worship, having ground and warrant of Scripture, which was begun,
ordained and practiced at the first by Christ's inspired Apostles, and was never
interrupted or intentionally profaned to this hour, by any orthodoxal Church
or person: but always confirmed and established by Christian Magistrates, and
practiced by all true Churches and Christians, in all ages from the Apostles
times to ours; the observation thereof must needs tie the conscience (for with
what conscience may any Church or person break it?) and the questioning or
breaking of it now, must needs prove a strange unheard nouelty, and headstrong
singularity, proceeding from a private spirit. But the former is true of the
Christian Sabbath. Thereforce the later also must needs be true.

62 The ninth argument is drawn from the circumstance and universality of
place: and custom of the true Churches of Christ in all places. It being
practiced; at first at Jerusalem and Troas. 2. Then at Corinth and Galathia. 3.
Then in Pathmos (and al Asia the less as is most probable.) 4. Then in the
Grecian Churches, as appears by the Greek Fathers. 5. Then in the Latin
Churches, as appears by the Latin Fathers. 6. And last of all in all
reformed later Churches, both of Lutherane and Orthodoxall judgment. And no
true Christian Church can be named that ever brake off the custom of this day,
received at the first from the Apostles. The force of this argument stands in
this: The Unity of custom, grounded on Gods word, observed by Apostolical
primitive orthodoxall and reformed later Churches, in matter tending to Gods
public service, does tie the conscience. The sanctifying of the first day of
the week is confirmed by such unity of custom. Therefore the sanctifying of
the 1. day of the week does ty the conscience. The Mayor or former proposition
is proved. 1. Cor. 1^. 16. and 14. 33. The Minor or assumption is already
proved. Neither let any man object these reasons to be Popish which are drawn
from custom, continuance of time and universality of place. For such reasons
are most forcible, that have ground of Scripture (which the Papists have not)
as neither have they continuance of time, or universality of place, if ye take
away their cracking and facing out the matter. And the Fathers rightly thus
fight against the sundry Haeritiques of their times, with these very
arguments.

63 The tenth Argument, is grounded on 2. Tim. 4. 2. Where Timothy is commanded
to preach the word in season and out of season: the which praecept is
perpetual and appliable to all ministers of the new Testament to the end of
the world; as that is Matt. 28. 19. 20. And that Minister, that so teaches not
in and out of season, directly sins, as breaking that commandment of Christ
and this of the Apostle: and incurreth that woe which the same Apostle
denounces on himself, if he neglects this duty. 1. Cor. 9. 16. Now what is
meant in this, for the Minister or public person to teach in season, but only
to teach in the season appointed by Christ and his Apostles, namely on the
public day of the Churches and Apostles practice, and customable meeting:
which being proved to have been usual on that day, (as also the ancient
Syriacke translation does plainly confirm, by adding these words unto the
narration of their common public meeting for receiung of the Lords Supper, 1.
Cor. 11. 20. When ye therefore are gathered together in die Domini nostri. On
our Lords day.) It follows of necessity the Minister by teaching must keep
the Lords day holy, and so by consequence, the people also by public and
solemn hearing. For there is no public teaching can be presupposed without
public hearing: no more then obedience is presupposed without command.

64 The eleventh Reason is concluded from the words of Matthew. 24. 20. The which
I can by no means ouerslip; For that I cannot be persuaded that Jesus Christ
our blessed Savior, and the wisdom of the Father, did speak in jest when as
he expressly and seriously commanded his hearers and disciples the Jews, and
those the ^lect and sanctified (for they only have the gift of invocation) to
pray: That their flight might not be on the Sabbath day; Speaking of the time
of sacking and euersion of Jerusalem: Now, if it had bin Ceremonial, and
abolished, they needed not have prayed, but have taken flight on that day,
as well as any other: without any scruple of conscience at all. Yea, it had been
a sin for godly Christian Jews to have made a needlesle conscience of a
ceremony, forty years after the abolishing: especially the Apostles doctrine
of avoiding the observation of Jewish days coming between. Gal. 4. 10. 11.
Coloss. 2. 16. 17. And last of al, it might seem vain in Jesus Christ, and a
mockery of his elect: (which were a blasphemy to say) to command them to pray
against the breaking of a Sabbath day, if it were abrogated long before, both
quo ad genus and speciem; that is both in respect of the special day (the
which the Jews observed) and also in respect of the moral of the fourth
Commandment (that is an holy observation of a seventh day unto God). Now the
special day which the Jew observed was ceremonial, and doubtless abrogated.
Col. 2. 16. 17. But the genus or moral of the fourth Commandment,
undoubtedly was not abolished. For John the writer of the Revelation (even
after the sacking and overthrow of Jerusalem) brings in the solemn mention of
the Christian Sabbath, under the title of the Lords day, as a common name
received generally and so termed by the Church by a note of excellence, as
peculiarly dedicated to the honor and service of God in Christ.

65 The twelfth Reason: Is drawn from the effects of the wisdom of the
flesh, and spirit; and thus is framed. 1. That ordinance tending to Gods
public worship and glory, and man's instruction and building up in godliness
and knowledge: The which is grounded on Gods holy word, and practice of the
holy and inspired Apostles: The which is liked of, approved of, and gladly
practiced with great spiritual comfort and profit, by the most godly,
virtuous, zealous and sincere godly learned writers, Teachers and Professors of
Gods truth: must needs be according to the will and ordinance of God. Such
is the ordinance of the Christian Sabbath. Therefore it is according to the
will and ordinance of God. The proposition is grounded on 1. Cor. 10. 11. 15.
and 14. 32. Mat. 13. 11. Dan. 12. 3. Psalm. 107. 43. Io. 5. 20. Io. 7. 17. The
assumption is confirmed on the evidence and truth of such effects in all the
godly of all places, and times, since the Apostles to our times. And the
serious and judicial Considerer shall observe them, both Ministers and people
among us in this Land, (to go no further) to be the most religious, zealous,
conscionable, and faithful Christians, and most of all profiting and growing
in all grace and knowledge, that with conscience, delight, and diligence do
effectually sanctify the Lords day. 2. Again, That ordinance tending to Gods
public service and glory, and man's instruction and building up in godliness,
and is grounded on Gods word: the which is disliked, disputed against, cauilled
at, withstood, broken and profaned by the most carnal, ungodly, irreligious,
corrupt and vain persons: must needs be most agreeing to the wisdom and will
of God. Such is the ordinance of the holy observation of the Lords day.
Therefore it is most agreeing to the wisdom and will of God. The Mayor or
first proposition is grounded on 1. Cor. 1. 18. and 2. 14. and 3. 19. Mat. 13.
11. Io. 3. 3. Romans 8. 5. 7. The assumption or Minor is grounded on Psa. 92. 1.
2. 6. and confirmed by experience. For he that shall impartially observe this
truth, shall find that the Sabbath every where is only disliked, withstood,
disgraced, disputed against, rayled at, scorned and profaned, by the most
profane, carnal, covetous, Atheists, libertines, men of no conscience,
holiness^, or truth in them: and such as either live in unlawful callings, or
unlawfully in their honest callings: such as fiddlers, stage players, bear and
bull-baiters, gamesters, drunkards, usurers, papists, families of love,
thieves, vagrantrogues, (wearers, oppressors, coseners, Epicures, and
voluptuous livers. 3. Again: That doctrine practice and persuasion the which
is grounded in the Scripture, and is most agreeable to godliness, peace of a
good conscience, and fits a Christian best to appear with security of heart and
joy before the judgment seat of Christ: that doctrine and persuasion must
needs be more agreeable to Gods will then contrary: such is the doctrine
practice and persuasion of keeping holy the Christian Sabbath or Lords day:
therefore the keeping holy of the lords day, together with the doctrine and
persuasion of the same is most agreeable to the will of God. 4. And last of
all, that doctrine practice and persuasion differing from the practice of the
Apostles and all Apostolical Churches and teachers, yea from the doctrine and
practice of the Church wherein they live, the which is most agreeable to the
will of man, the wisdom of the flesh, the manners of the wicked, the state of
ignorance and sin, and of an evil conscience, the hindrance of the Gospel,
the the breach of all good Discipline, and order in the Church, and the very
high way to Atheism, carnal liberty, and all impious licentiousness and
confusion; and so by consequence procuring and increasing the wrath and
judgment of God: or even but tending thereunto, or any part thereof, is impious
and ungodly. Such is the judgment and practice of the deniers or disgracers,
or opposite disputers, or omitters or profaneners of the Lords day: and of
those also that teach a liberty of breaking or omitting of the Lords day.
Therefore such judgment, practice or persuasion is impious and wicked, And so
much of the second Quaestion.

66 The third Quaestion and the last, concerning this Controversy of the
Christian Sabbath, is this: Whether the Church of GOD might have chosen at
the first another day, or has yet authority or Christian liberty to abrogate
or alter the Lords day into any other certain or uncertain day; or whether it
be not of necessity to be observed to the end of the World.

67 This Quaestion because it depends on the former: therefore the affirmation
and proof of the former proves also the negation of the former part hereof,
and the affirmation of the later: the which I therefore will the more briefly
handle as a point sufficiently confirmed.

68 The first Reason: The Church has no Christian liberty to alter any day the
which has absolute Commandment in the Word. The Christian Sabbath or Lords
day has absolute Commandment in the Word: as already has been proved.
Therefore the Church has no Christian liberty to alter the Lords day into any
other.

69 The second Reason: The Church could never alter any part of the Moral law,
or of the law of Nature: nor cannot alter the moral ordinances and
constitutions of the inspired Apostles. The observation or keeping holy of one
day of every seven, is of the Moral law and law of Nature; and besides, the
keeping holy of the first day of the week is a constitution and commandment
of the inspired Apostles. Therefore the Church could not nor cannot alter the
keeping holy of one day of seven unto God: nor the keeping holy of the first
day of the week to Christ.

70 The third Reason: whatsoever Christ ascribes as his own and proper to
himself, no Church or Christian ought or may ascribe unto themselves: But
Christ ascribes as proper to himself, that he is the Lord of the Sabbath:
Therefore, no church or person may ascribe the Sabbath of Christ to himself:
and so by consequence may not profane nor alter the Lords day into any other.

71 The fourth Reason. By whatsoever only power the Jewish Sabbath was
abrogated, and the Christian Sabbath instituted; by the same power and none
other can it be abrogated again. But by the only power of Christ his
Consummatum est or sacrifice, was the Jewish Sabbath abrogated, and by virtue
of his resurrection the Lords day originally instituted, and by Apostolical
power and authority the one relinquished, and the other practiced. Therefore by
the only power of Christ and his Apostles and by none other can the Lords day
be abolished again.

72 The fifth Reason. If there cannot come so long as the world lasts so great
a cause of changing the Lords day as the Apostles had of ordaining it; Then the
Church cannot abolish the Lords day to the end of the world. But so great cause
of abolishing the Lords day, the Church can never have, as the Apostles had of
ordayning: namely the resurrection and rest of Christ. Therefore the Church
cannot abolish the Lords day to the end of the world.

73 The sixth and last Reason. If the Church have no farther aucthority then by
the word of God either in general or special to appoint or alter any thing
established, then the Church can never alter the Lords day, nor appoint any
other in the stead thereof. But the former is true; and therefore also the
later. For there is no shadow of authority or ground either general or
special in the word, touching the alteration of the Lords day or appointing of
any other in the stead thereof. And finally, unless the Church has the same
infallible warrant to be led into all truth as the inspired Apostles had
(which the Papists falsely affirm; but we constantly deny) the Church can
never have equal power in abolishing the observation of the first day of the
week as the Apostles had in ordayning: and so by consequence can it never be
lawfully accomplished, for want of due power to perform the same. So that it
follows by inevitable consequence, that the keeping holy of the Lords day, or
first day of the week, must vnremoouedly stand unto the end of the World. And
so an end of this third and last question.

74 Now touching the objections that are alleged against the keeping holy of
the Lords day; they are of sundry sorts, as are the various apprehensions and
opinions of men erring on the right and left hand of the truth. The which their
differing cauillations albeit it were not quite amiss to have confuted on
either side: yet I have thought it fitter at this time to let them pass, least
the Reader might be rather tired then instructed: the rather because the most
of them in very deed are but of froathy and feeble nature, and are not able to
stand or to maintain themselves; the day revealing them to be but false, and
the fire but stubble, being grounded on an evil conscience, maintained by more
subtilty then truth or art, answered by sundry others, and are abundantly
confuted by the former reasons. Only I purpose to take notice and give answer
unto the cauillations of our present times, which bear the greatest show
both against the things alleged for the truth, as also for establishment of
their own error.

75 Against the places of Scripture alleged for the Christian Sabbath; They
say that the reasons drawn from Act. 20. 7. and 1. Cor. 16. 2. make nothing for
the confirmation of the Lords day. For that the Greek word sounds in both
places one of the Sabbaoths: which being literally understood must needs have
reference to the Jews Sabbath, not to the first day of the week which is our
Lords day. To which objection first I oppose the maine stream of all
Interpreters that ever were both old and new, that understand them for the
first day of the week, and do so translate them. Secondly, I say it is an
Hebraisme or Hebrewe kind of speech usual in the Scriptures to set down One
insteade of the first: as Genesis 1. 5. Mat. 28. 1. Mark 16 9. Luke, 24. 1. Io,
20. 1. And the word Sabbath for a Week. As Leuiticus, 25. 8. Luke, 18. 12.
((...).) And thus do Calvin, Martyr, Beza. B B. Hooper: and even the learned
Papists: Erasmus, Iansenius, Bellarmine, Emanuel Sa: and sundry others, observe
upon these places. And further for the place of the 1. Corinthians. 16. 2. It is
very evident out of the Fathers, Justinius, Tertullian, and others, that from
the ordinance of the Apostles grounded on this place, the primitive times did
make collections for the poor on this very day which was the first day of
the week celebrated by them to the honor of Christ his resurrection and
public worship of God; as Zanchius that most learned and judicial Divine
does soundly conclude. Besides, there want not ancient manuscripts to make this
place more manifest by adding (...) to the Text: as Beza notes, and Cryspine
in his greek Testament together with Wechelus in his edition of the
Septuaginta do express. Touching the place of Apoc. 1. 10. which makes
clear mention of the Lords day; the observation whereof is seconded by the
Primitive Fathers and Churches immediately succeeding the writer of that book:
they have nothing to allege, but that they hold it doubtful whether that
book be Canonical or not. Which cavil albeit it be unanswerably confuted by
Beza and sundry others: yet I judge it sitter to be decided by a cudgel of the
Magistrates own faggot, (or the hatchet rather) then to be notized or
vouchsafed the peaceable or quiet answer of sober men; for that it must needs
be an opinion of insolent and palpable lewdness, that cannot stand but by
calling the undoubted Scriptures of canonical authority, and principles of the
Christian faith in quaestion.

76 For the confirmation of their most weak and bad opinion, they brokenly
allege certain Scriptures, from which they draw even by the ears against
their wills three several conclusions. The first conclusion is this: The fourth
Commandment is merely Ceremonial, and therefore utterly abolished and is
Jewish to observe. To this I say in general it crosses all men's iudgemens
that ever were of any note as in part appears These. 20. and therefore is
actually absurd and a very Nouel, and is besides the door to Atheism,
carnal liberty and all profaneness, a manifest disabling of the other 9.
Commandments and occasion of neglect given to them especially that care for
none. For further answer to this bare Assertion, Look These. 45. 46. 47. 48.
49. 50. But for the Scriptures they allege for the ground of this their
Conclusion as Exodus, 31. 13. 16. and 35. 2. Ezechiel, 20. 12: They are too
short for their position; for these places prove the Jewish Sabbath to have
in it something ceremonial, transitory, and as the shadow abolished by Christ
the substance, Coloss. 2. 16. 17. in that part wherein it was ceremonial,
which was merely proper to the Jew: but by this they disprove not the Sabbath
days political respect of rest of the bodies of ourselves, our servants and
our Cattle, Exodus, 20. 17. with Deu. 5. 14. and moral part thereof; which is
the public worship of God. Exo. 20. 9. 10. which are perpetually to remain as
the other laws of like equity and nature, being especially by Christ confirmed
and by his Apostles and Primitive Churches continued, and by us therefore to
be practiced to the Worlds end. Wherefore the stricte observation also of a
holy rest or Sabbath unto God in the new Testament is not a Jewish thing. For
seeing the Jew did rest by a mixed reason Iunius de polit: Mosis: cap. 8.
partly moral, partly political, and partly ceremonial; We rest in no sense
for the later but the former two. Namely first for the Moral and then for the
political respect: which seeing they are commanded us as strictly; and
concern us at nearly as they did the Jews; we ought with no less
conscience to observe them then the Jews. And seeing the actions of men are
really distinguished by their ends for which they are done; and we proposing
not the Ceremonial or end proper to the Jew, but only the Moral common to
us with them: our stricte observing of the Lords day cannot be counted
Jewish, though hereby also we forbid the very gathering of any stick or
kindling of any fire that shall hinder the service of GOD in our selves or
others.

77 The second Conclusion that they frame is this: All days are alike, no
difference in the Gospel by the word of God, and are distinguished only by the
Magistrates, not by Gods command. Nay farther (except the Magistrate enjoin)
it were a sin to observe religiously any days for the solemn service of God
above others. The proofs hereof are Romans 14. 6. Gal. 4. 10. Col. 2. 16. 17.
The former of the which, namely, Romans 14. 6. argues our Christian liberty, in
respecting all days alike which are not discerned (say these men) by the
commandment of a Magistrate: of the Church say the Rhemistes: but of neither
says Master Fulke, but of the commandment of God only: and so is this place
sufficiently answered. Master Greenham (a man of reverend memory) answers
this objection, by affirming him the weaker Christian that counts all days
alike. V. 5. for that he must needs be weak in Christianity that esteems
all days alike notwithstanding the plain constitution and practice of the
inspired Apostles going before. The ancient Fathers, Origin, Ambrose,
Oecumenius Primasius, Anselmus, do understand the Apostle to speak of fasting
from meats on certain days, and (as Chrysostom, Theodoret and Theophilact
define it) from swines flesh: which days and abstinence say Calvin,
Bullinger, Beza, Oleuian, Piscator, Erasmus, Lyra, and the very Rhemists, are
to be construed of the ceremonies merely Jewish and ceremonial: with the
which sense this Scripture being limited, it includes not the days
established and practiced in the new Testament by Apostolical authority. The
other places of Gal. 4. 10. and Col. 2. 16. 17. are by all Interpreters also
understood of the Jewish festiuities, so far forth only as they were
Ceremonials, figures and shadows of things to come, and being abolished by
Christ his coming ought not to be observed any longer. And this, the very
scope of the Apostle, circumstances of the places, and manner of speaking and
noting the names of the days and times and that in the plural number,
abundantly confirm. And thus does Calvin, Beza, Marlorat, Zanchius, Piscator,
Lyra, Erasmus, the Papist Bellarmine and Rhemists, and (before them) all the
stream of Grecian Fathers with Hierome and Augustine, interpret both these
Scriptures; so that (as Zanchius speaks) The Apostle in these places does not
forbid that there should be any certain days publicly solemnized in the
Church, wherein the faithful might assemble to pray and to receive the
Sacraments together. For the Apostles and other the godly did usually come
together on the Lords day, and would that al things should be done by order in
the Church. Wherefore (says he) unless we would affirm that the Apostle did
contradict himself, it must needs be confessed that the Apostle in these
places to the Gal. and Col. did nothing less then teach that no days should
be solemnly observed in the Church of Christ.

78 The third Conclusion sounds thus: Every day is a continual Sabbath in
Christ his Kingdom: and that is a rest from sin and a continual serving of
God. So far should we be, of observing one day above another. The places of
their proof are Esaias, 66. 23. and 56. 1. 2. and 58. 13. 14. Hebr. 4. 6. 7. 8
9. 10. But here hence they conclude just nothing to the point. For the first
place; Calvin, Bucholcher, and others interpret it of the eternal rest in
heaven; or if we take it for the Christian Sabbath (as Chemnitius and others
do) why may we not understand it, as also Esaias, 56. 2. 4. 6. 7. both for a
prophecy and prescription of the Gentiles sanctifying of the Christian Sabbath
in the new Testament, seeing the Prophet (specially in the later place) speaks
evidently of the Church of God among the Gentiles which must needs be in the
new Testament? The second and third places do affirm thus much, that we ought
not to commit any sin upon the Sabbath. What then? will they therefore
conclude we ought not to observe any certain Sabbath day? it were too absurd.
Now the last place teaches that Christians ought to rest from the^ own works,
that is from sin and disobedience, continually: but what hinders this the
Christian Sabbath or settled proportion of time of the public worship of
God, by the he^ring of the word, by prayer and receiving of the Sacraments. Nay
by these collections either we must have no certain solemn days at all: And
then (says Calvin) Praesentissima impendet Ecclesiae perturbatio and ruina. A
most praesent Instit. lib. 2. ca. 8.. 32.
ruin and confusion will come unto the Church: Or else in the other extremity
we must do nothing else every day, then meet together publicly, and without
intermission continually to hear, to pray, to take the Sacraments. And then
what shall become of the Commonwealth and householde, the Magistrate and
Master, the subject and the servant? how shall the one rule, or the other obey
and serve? what use of our daily callings? who shall provide for our families
whiles we (worse then Insidels) cast off the care thereof? how shall we cloth
and feed our bodies? or what use shall there be of those Commandments of
GOD, which were given before the Law; In the sweat of thy brows thou shall
eat thy bread? Or in the Law. Six days thou shall labor. Or in the
Gospel. We command them to work with quietness, and to eat their own
bread? So that this fancy d^^^es men either into one extremity of Atheism,
to observe and sanctify no public days at all; or of Iudaisme, to Sabbatize
all days in the superlatiue degree. Other conclusions there are hammered out
of other Scriptures: as namely, Mark, 2. 7. The Sabbath was made for man:
therefore man may use it or not use it at his pleasure; as though Baptism or
the Lords Supper, the ministry and preaching of the Word, and other ordinances
of God, were not made for m^n, ^^ (if they were) as if man might use them at
his pleasure. A^^ine, Matthew, 12. 8. Christ is the Lord of the Sabbath; and
therefore as Lord might abrogate the Sabbath, and admit this to be true, yet
neither does it prove that he abolished other the^ the Ceremonial; neither
disprove ^ut that he established the Moral part of the Sabbath for ever. But I
am ashamed of the seelinesse of these objections: enough to make a man
persuaded that some enemy of theirs should father them upon them to abuse them;
save that the maintayners of such opinion may justly seem to be but men
insensible. Wherefore until I see reasons more forcible then these, confirming
a more probable opinion then this, I will leave both reasons and opinion as I
find them, and in the mean time will be bold to say; Such as the weak
foundation is, such is the building.

And thus (O Reader) according to the model of my praesent strength, thou have
the truth of the Christian Sabbath proposed and confirmed to thy conscience: A
doctrine harmless, true, and holy, making thee holy and praeparing thee to
heaven, agreeing to the Scripture, to right reason, to common ciuility, and
even to civil policies. A doctrine conforming us to the Commandment of God,
yea even to his blessed and holy Image. A doctrine bringing much glory unto
God, and benefit to man, knowledge to the ignorant, sense unto the hardened,
direction to the willing, discipline to the irregular, conscience to the
obstinate, comfort to the conscienced, and bringing none inconvenience in the
world. A doctrine that adds face, fashion, growth and firmitude unto a
Church, strength and comely order to a Commonwealth; giving propagation unto
the Gospel, help and vigor to the laws: ease, honor, and obedience unto the
Governors: unity and quiet to the people: and lastly, certain happiness and
blessing to them all. For the which doctrine whosoever argues, pleads for
GOD, for his glory, for his worship, for his Commandment and will, for his
Word, his Sacraments, and invocation: for the Law, for the Gospel, for Moses,
and the Prophets, for CHRIST and his Apostles, for the upholding and
flourishing estate of the Church and Commonwealth, of Schools and
Universities, and of the faithful Ministry of Christ. In a word they plead
for the wearied bodies rest, for the evil conscience quiet; for the sound
practice of godliness and mercy, in a certain, settled, and constant order.
And so by consequence for heaven it self.

The contrary judgment works contrary effects. For it depriueth GOD of his
honor, the Church of Religion, the Common wealth of order, the body of rest,
the soul of instruction, the life of direction, the word of attendance, the
ministry of reverence, and draws along a world of inconveniences and
mischiefs besides. For it plainly breeds sloth and scandal in the
Ministry: neglect and mere contempt of Ministry in the people; confirming
blindness and superstition in the ignorant, quenching the zeal of the more
forward: strengthening the hands of the more wicked, and giving liberty to them
that are too apt to take it of profaning of the Sabbath day of God. It hinders
the course of the Gospel, depriueth of the means of godliness, it defaceth
the beauty, and cuts in two the very sinews of the Church, enlarging Satan's
horrid kingdom and power of darkness, by giving strength to Athisme, Papisme,
and carnal gospelling; Abolishing the Universities by inevitable consequence,
and shaking the frame and fabric, yea poisoning up the vital powers of the
very Commonwealth: And in a word drawing on confusion, irreligion, Barbarism,
Gods curse and utter desolation on them all.

Wherefore the truth of this doctrine of the Christian Sabbath being clear:
it follows that all adversary judgments to it are condemned: whether they
be Swinckefeldians, that will have no ministry: or Familists and their fellow
Anabaptists that will have no Sabbath, or Jews that insist upon the Legal
Sabbath, or Papists that hold the Sabbath sanctified by their impious Mass
and other Antichristian Idolatries and will-worships; or Libertines that give
themselves and others liberty to labor on the Sabbath, or to profane it by
vain sports, games, recreations, feastinges, dauncings, Maypoles, Church-ales,
stage plays, and the like, more then heathenish vanities, or whatsoever may be
called the will or ways of man, or whatsoever tends to profane or hinder the
effectual sanctifying of the Christian Sabbath: whose several obliquities,
(being opposite to al sound judgments and Christian practice) sufficiently
manifest the falsehood of themselves, and mutually confute each other, being
compared with the truth of God.

It remains that thou be exhorted (O Christian peruset of this truth of God)
unto the conscionable and careful practice of the Christian Sabbath. Consider
with thy self the reasons that have been alleged; and let the evidence of
them cause thee to captiuate thy thoughts unto them. And know, that if among
them all but one be true, it is enough; one is too much for a Christian man to
deprave or cauell at, who believes a Judgment day to come: I doubt not but a
man might more easily persuade the multitude to any extremity then to the
right, and so to break the Sabbath then to keep it holy: corrupted doctrines
are familiar to corrupted nature. And it is not hard to persuade unto that
liberty, which all men plead for and pursue. Nay more, it is not possible for
any man to teach that liberty which the most part will not far exceed in
practice. So unseasonable are the doctrines of letting slack the reins of
godliness unto this head strong and unruly age of ours: and so unsound;
against the which all sound and learned judgments, and godly Churches and
persons practice, are oppositely set. And therefore if the Apostles and all
faithful teachers and servants of God have walked in this path before, wherein
they passed through and from this world, without either outward inconvenience,
or inward wound of conscience; but with much spiritual profit and sensible
increase of knowledge and of grace, and with continual, final, and
unspeakable peace and comfort: who will not hazard the imitation of their
practice for the gayning of like benefit? Or who, that has not set his
conscience and common sense to sale, will leave the certain way of all the
Saints and seek a new found way, which no man ever went to gain the
blessings they enjoyed? For, did they enjoy so great benefits by sanctifying
this day, and do thou think to get them by profaning it? My judgment is, he
that will have a way of his own finding, it were fit he enjoyed a heaven of
his own making. But (O Christian Reader) if ever thou will sanctify thine
everlasting Sabbath in heaven, Learn then effectually to sanctify it upon
earth, according to the Commandment and will of God: which if the more wilful
will not do, who walk in the wide way of the greater part of men, yet Christ
shall not want to sanctify a day unto himself; It shall be done in despite
of them, without them: and they shall melt away in leaving of the truth they
saw, and winked at. And albeit the Pharisees do still despise the counsel of
God against themselves, and some perverse ones will be ever carping and
corroding of this truth, yet Wisdom will be justified of all her children.

GAL. 6. 16. As many as walk according to this rule; peace shall be upon them
and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.


The Practice of the Christian Sabbath, according to the WORD.
THe Practice of the Christian Sabbath stands either in 1. Praeparation to
it: 2. Sanctification of it.

I. Praeparation, is a fitting of our selves before hand, to perform the duties
of the Sabbath according to Gods will: which duty the Church of God among the
Jews did most carefully use and practice, the day before the Sabbath. Mark.
15. 42. Luke 23. 54. A duty needful in respect of 1. The glorious praesence
of God in whose sight we are, and before whom we are more specially to praesent
our selves the next day. Esa. 1. 12. Habac. 1. 13. 2. In respect of the
holiness and purity that is required of us in using the sacred ordinances of
God, Psalm. 93. 5. 2. Tim. 2. 19. Psalm. 50. 16. 17. Mich. 6. 6. 8. 3. And lastly
in respect of the vanity and profaneness of our nature, and thereby our
unfitness to use Gods ordinances. Romans 7. 15. 18. 19. 23. Eccles. 4. 17. The
duties of praeparation are either 1. Special and proper to that day: 1. In
observing the due time of the Christian Sabbath, which doubtless is one whole
natural day: as appears, Exodus 20. 10. Leuit. 23. 32. which time begins at
the evening before the day (which is the time of praeparation) and ends also
on the Sabbath even (the time appointed by God of natural rest.) Nehem. 13.
19. with Leuit. 23. 32. 2. In remoouing all things that may hinder the
sanctifying of it the next day, both in our selves and in our servants: and
this we are to prevent with special care and providence: both to keep the
peace and quiet of our conscience in preventing of a sin, causing us to profane
the Sabbath: as also thereby to redeem our spiritual profit, and to cut away
occasion of offense and evil example unto others, Exodus 16. 23.
2. Common to other days, and therefore now especially required: and they are,
1. Examining our consciences: and repentance. 1. Cor. 11. 28. Psalm. 119. 59. 2.
Reading, and Meditation of Gods word. Psalm. 1. 2. and 119. 97. Iosu. 1. 8.
Deuteronomy. 6. 6. 8. 9. and 11. 19. Io. 5. 35. Col. 3. 16. 3. Instruction, examining
and praeparing of our Families, Deuteronomy. 6. 7. and 11. 18. 20. Genes. 18. 19.
Iosu. 24. 15. 4. Prayer, invocation, confession, petition, intercession and
praise, Col. 3. 17. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 17. 18. 5. Singing of Psalms. Iam. 5. 13.
Col. 3. 16. Ephesians. 5. 19. 6. Sobriety of diet and going to bed in due time: that
our bodies be not disquieted, or distempered, and made unfit and vnpraepared to
the duties of the Sabbath. Psalm. 4. 8. Luke 21. 34.


II. Sanctification, of the Sabbath day it self: the performance whereof God
bids us, Remember, because we easily forget the best and most needful
duties. Wherein every person is to observe his duty required. The forgetting or
neglecting whereof is to be accounted unto God. And the persons are
I. The Magistrate, or Person having authority; either the 1. Greater: of the
Commonwealth: whosoever has public lawful power to command or overrule,
more or less. The greater Magistrate is called to be a nursing Father of the
Church of God, Esa. 49. 23. And therefore herein must he look and remember that
the Church be fed, and not delivered over to dry Nurses that statue their
children. They are Gods ordinance and Ministers, and their power is of God.
Romans 13. 1. 2. 6. For else they could do nothing. Io. 19. 11. This they must
acknowledge and therefore honor God, and uphold his ordinances above all
things, under the penalty of a heavy woe. 1. Sam. 2. 30. their due is limited.
Matt. 22. 21. They must therefore give to God his due: else they must know that
God can abase them that walk in pride, in whose eyes they are as nothing. Dan.
4. 32. 34. They are also called gods in respect of that Image to which they
ought to be conformed, and must fear God. Exodus, 18. 2. Else they shall dye
like men: Psalm. 82. 6. 7. Lastly, they are to know that by Christ kings
reign. Prou. 8. 15. Therefore they must employ their power and authority to
the service and glory of Christ; and so to kiss the Son of God: and that
also under pain, least Christ be angry, and he break them in pieces like a
Potters vessel. Psalm. 2. 11. 12. 9. Wherefore seeing Christ is now Lord of the
Sabbath, Mat. 12. 8. they must take especial care not to usurp the right of
Christ, but serve the Lord in fear, and remember to keep holy the Christian
Sabbath; whereof they have clear and express Commandment, Exodus 28. 9. 10.
Ezech. 46. 2. 4. 10. Because the kingdom is our Lords and his Christ's. Who is
the King of kings, and Lord of lords. Reu. 11. 15. and 17. 14. and 19. 6. 16.
The duty of the Magistrate of the Commonwealth, is 1. To repress the
profaning of the Sabbath: for, Qui non prohibet cum potest, iubet. Leu. 19.
17. This duty stands in using all means whereby the profaning of the Sabbath
is repressed: Namely, to forbid, Neh. 13. 15. reprove, Neh. 13. 17. 18.
threaten, Neh. 13. 21. hinder: Neh. 13. 19. 22. and punish the profaning of it.
Neh. 13. 20. 2. To command and compel it to be sanctified. 2. Chron. 34. 33.
Exodus 20. 10. Ios. 24. 15. 3. To sanctify it himself, his children, Nobles,
attendants and whole Court, both privately. Psalm, 5. 7. Acts. 10. 1. 2. As also
publicly. Ezech. 46. 2. 4. 10. 2. King. 11. 5. 7. 9. The duties of private and
public sanctifying, Look further in the duties of the people: to which the
Prince and other Magistrate is no less strictly tied, then the meanest of his
subjects or inferiors.
2. The Lesser: as every householder over his family: who also may be called a
less Magistrate, as man is called a lesser world; In respect of the authority
he has to command. Mat. 8. 9. Ephesians. 6. 1. 5. also of the duty required of
him. Genesis 18. 19. Ephesians. 6. 4. Psalm. 101. 6. 7. and lastly of the account that
he must make to God; Col. 3 25. Exodus 20. 8. 9. 10. The special duties of the
Householder are: 1. To sanctify it and keep it holy himself, with all care
and conscience. Ex. 20. 10. Thou -- Remember. 2. To command and compel his
family hereunto, that they may effectually practice it as well as himself. Gen,
18. 19. Ios. 24. 15. Esth. 4. 16. Act. 10. 1. 2. Psalm. 101. 6. 7. Exodus 20. 10.
Thy Son, thy Daughter, thy man and maide-seruant. Remember. 3 To cause the
very Stranger and beast to rest: Exodus 20. 10. Prou. 12. 10.

II. The Minister of God, or Teacher of Gods word; who is Gods steward: and
therefore is required to be 1. wise and. 2. faithful, to rule and give them
their portion of meat in season (in the season appointed of God: Remember thou
keep holy the Sabbath day.) Luke 12. 42. He is given of God unto his Church
for the gathering of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, and building up
of Gods Church (to which purpose, the Sabbath was ordained.) Ephesians. 4. 11. 12.
13. He is commanded to preach. 1. in season (of Gods Sabbath) 2. and out of
season (at all sit times and just occasions)* 1. Tim. 4. 2. Therefore he is
effectually also and principally to sanctify the Christian Sabbath above al
others; seeing it is a good thing on the Sabbath to declare the works and word
of God. Psalm. 92. 1. 2. 4. 5. And he the public person appointed to be the
public declarer of Gods word and works, Ezech. 3. 17. He must therefore
sanctify the Sabbath day, seeing he is the Agent and Minister of Christ, and
the disposer of the secrets of God: and therefore he is especially appointed to
be faithful, and that under a fearful woe and penalty. 1. Cor. 9. 16. Matt.
24. 51. Luke, 12. 47. 48. He must I say sanctify the Sabbath; and that by the
word of God and prayer, which are the means of sanctifying every creature of
God. 1. Tim. 4. 5. Of the which sanctifying he has a special charge. Ezechi.
44. 23. 24. and the contrary whereof is a most grievous and expressed sin.
Ezech. 22. 26. The duties of the Minister, upon the Christian Sabbath, are
these: 1. To assemble the Congregation, to admonish and cause the people to
come together. Acts. 20. 17. 18. and 14. 27. Joel. 1. 13. 14. and 2. 15. 16. 2.
Invocation, and worship of God for and with the Congregation: in a language
understood. Under this duty are contained 1. Confession of sins. Leu. 16. 29.
30. 31. 1. Cor. 11. 28. Esth. 9. 6. 2 Petition. Act. 16. 13. Nehem. 9. 3. 1.
Tim. 2. 1. 3 Deprecation. Joel. 2, 17. 4 Intercession. Act. 12. 5. 1. Tim. 2.
1. 5 Praise and thanksgiving. Psalm. 92. 1. 2. 2. Chron. 30. 21. Neh. 9. 5. Tim.
2. 1. 6 Blessing of the people. Leu. 9. 22. 23. Numb. 6. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 2.
Chron. 30. 27. Psalm. 118. 26.
3 To read the Scriptures and that every Sabbath; and and that also in a
language understood by the people. Act. 13. 15. and 15. 21. Col. 4. 16. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 27. 2. Chron 34. 30. Neh. 8. 3. 9. 4 To preach the word of God; Act.
20. 7. and 16. 13. Mark. 1. 21. and 6. 1. This he must perform, by preaching 1
All the counsel of God: not keeping any thing back that is profitable. Act.
20. 20. 27. Mat. 28. 20. 2 Only the word of God: the doctrine according unto
godliness, the true pattern of wholesome words, the things that become
wholesome doctrine. 1. Pet. 4. 11. 1. Timot. 6. 3. 2. Tim. 1. 13. Tit. 2. 1. Not
fables, Philosophy, profane and vain babbling, and oppositions of science. 1.

sincerely. 1. Cor. 4. 2. 2. Cor. 2. 17. and 4. 2. Ier. 23. 28. Neither
pleasing, or false, or strange doctrine: nor for vaineglory, contention or

the Lord. Hebr. 5. 12. and 6. 1. Luke 1. 4. 1. Corinthians. 3. 1. Galath. 6. 6.
Mark 10. 14. 2. Tim. 3. 15.
III. The people: or whole Congregation; who are called the people of God. 1.
Pet. 2. 10. and of Gods pasture. Psalm. 95. 7. his sheep, Ibide^. his servants.
1. Pet. 2. 16. his Church. 1. Tim. 3. 5. 15. his inheritance. Isay 19. 25.
Kingdom of Christ. Ioh. 3. 5. Mat. 3. 2. The body of Christ, which is the head
thereof. Coloss. 1. 18. 24. A chosen generation, a royal Priesthood, an holy
nation, a peculiar people, that they should show forth the virtues of him, that
has called them out of darkness into his marvelous light. 1. Pet. 2. 9.
They therefore must also keep holy the Sabbath. 1. Both to the honor of Christ
the Lord of the Sabbath. Matt. 12. 8. after whose excellent name they are
called: and into whose name they were baptized. Mat. 28. 19. Acts. 2. 38. and
19. 5. 2. As also in respect of their own spiritual profit, instruction, and
comfort. The sanctification of the Christian Sabbath; by the people is either
1 Public: the which is sanctified by the Christian people with public
means, and after a public and free manner; as it ought always so long as
the visible Church remains, or a case of necessity enforce not the contrary.
2 Private: is such as is performed by private persons, and after a private
manner: namely, when Christians cannot sanctify the Sabbath publicly, in
regard of 1 The absence of Gods public ordinances: as public preaching,
prayer etc. 2 The times of common war or persecution. 3 A case of inevitable
and most necessary travel, which cannot be deferred or avoided: or in case of
sickness, imprisonment, hard service, slavery, oppression, or captivity of any
particular person and the like case: wherein God accepts our holy desire and
honest endeavor according to that we have, and not according to that we have not.
The public sanctifying of the Christian Sabbath, stands in duties either
affirmative. negative.
The duties affirmative are such as Christians are commanded and tied in
conscience to perform: and are either works of 1 Piety. 2 Mercy.
The works of Pyety are performed either 1 In the duties themselves, being
main and direct worships of God. 2 In the circumstances tending to the better
permance of them.


*1. The duties themselves of Pyety to be performed by the Christian people are
these: 1 To hearken to Gods word preached publicly by a lawful and
authorized Teacher. This they are required to do, with 1 Fear, reverence, and
humility. Esa. 66. 2. Psalm. 5. 7. Number. 16. 22. 2 Joy, gladness, and
cheerfulness. Act. 13. 48. 1 Thessalonians. 1. 6. 3 Attention, diligence, heed, and
watchfulness. Act. 16. 14. Eccles. 4. 17. Luke, 4. 20. 2. Pet. 1. 19. 4 Faith,
consent, and application of the doctrine and uses. Romans 10. 17. Hebr. 4. 2.
Luke 4. 22, and 7, 35. Act. 17. 34. Io. 10. 26. 27. Act. 13. 48. and 28. 24.
Ephesians. 1. 13.
2. To receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; as often as thou may. Act.
16. 13. 15. and 20. 7. This must be performed, with 1 Repentance; examining and
judging ourselves: and with a good conscience. 1. Pet. 3. 21. 1. Cor. 11. 28
Mark. 1. 4. 2. Chro. 30. 19. 2 Faith and application. Mark. 16. 16. Act. 8. 37.
Mat. 26. 28. 1. Cor. 10. 3. 4. Io. 6. 63. 64. 2. Cor. 13. 5. Gal. 3. 26. 27. 3
Love, 1. Cor. 10. 17. and 11. 18. Act. 2. 41. 42 46. Io. 13. 2. 35. 1. Cor. 12.
13. 4 Thankfulness. Matthew. 26. 26, 30. 1. Cor. 11. 25. 26. 2. Chro. 30. 15,
21. 1. Cor. 10. 16.
Also remember always to be praesent at the baptism of infants. 1. That thou
may est omit no part of the public worship of God, but pray with the Church
and Congregation. 2. That thou may est outwardly grace Gods ordinance and
countenance it (as it were) with thy praesence, and not disgrace, or seem to
scorn it by turning thy back unto it. 3. That Gods public ordinance may be
publickely not privately performed, 4. That thou also may est hereby call to
mind thy Covenant with God in Baptism, and Gods covenant made with thee: and
examine what fruit thereof appears within thee, that thou may est bless God,
if thou find the same effectual; and be humbled to labor unto it if thou
find it to be small. 3. To pray to God and praise him. Matthew. 18. 19. 1. Tim.
2. 1. 2. This duty must also be done, with 1 Humility: and sense of Gods purity
and our own unworthiness. Psalm. 2. 11. and 145. 19. Luke 18. 13. Esa. 56.
15. and 66. 2. Psalm. 51. 17. Hebr. 5. 7. 2 Sense and feeling of our wants, with
hunger and desire of obtaining them. Col. 1. 9. Psalm. 16. 17. and 38. 9. Neh.
1. 11. Mat. 5. 6. Luke 11. 13. 3 Feruency and heartinesse: James 5. 16. Romans
12. 11. Psalm. 25. 1. and 119. 5. 4 Faith and persuasion of obtaining, upon Gods
merciful nature and promises. 1. Io. 5. 14. and 3. 22. Mat. 21. 22. Iam. 1. 6.

11. 25. 26. 1. Pet. 3. 7. 1. Tim. 2. 8. 6 Holiness of life, and a good
conscience: 2. Tim. 2. 19. 22. 1. Tim. 2. 8. 1. Io. 3. 22. Ioh. 15. 7. Esa. 1.
15. Job. 22 23. 27. Psalm. 66. 18.
4 To sing the Psalms and spiritual songs indicted by the Holy Ghost. The
which duty because it is a special part of Gods worship (those duties and
affections being performed and required in singing of psalms, which are
performed and required in prayer) we are therefore to attend unto it with all
care and conscience, by how much the more it is neglected commonly. Herein
these duties are commanded: that namely it be performed 1 With understanding.
1. Cor. 14. 15. Psalm. 47. 7. 2 With heart and spirit. 1. Corinthians. 14. 15. Col.
3. 16. Ephesians 5. 19. 3 With a grace and decency. Col. 3. 16. 4 With melody,
mirth, instruction, and comfort to ourselves. Ephesians. 5. 19. Col. 3. 16. Iam. 5.
13. 5 Unto the Lord in a direct intention, being so affected as the matter of
the Psalm, and our own praesent estate does occasion: this being also (as
before is said) a part of Gods worship. Ephesians. 5. 19. Col. 3. 16. Judges. 5. 3.
Psalm. 7. 17. and 30. 4. and 47. 6. and 92. 1. and 111. 1. and 137. 4.

2. The circumstances tending to the better performance of these worships of
God: and they are to be considered according to the times; which are,
1 Before the exercise of the Word and Prayer; 1 Rising early, both fitly to
prepare our selves: as also to consecrate as much of the Lords day unto the
Lords service and worship as we can. Ier. 7. 25. and 32. 3. Mark. 1. 35. with
ver. 38. 39. Luke 24. 1. 2 Examining of our consciences, and confessing of our
sins to God: that we may bring into the presence of God, and assembly of the
Saints, the peace of a quiet heart. 1. Cor. 11. 28. 1. Pet. 3. 31. To the which
is required a taking heed unto our ways, and a careful study of holiness
the whole week before. 2. Tim. 2. 19. Psalm. 50. 15. Esa. 1. 15. 3 To join
with our families in private prayer: or if our estate and condition be not
such, yet by our selves to pray fervently unto God. 1. Both for our selves that
we may be profitable hearers for understanding, memory, grace and a blessing
of the word. Psalm. 119. 18. Prou. 2. 3. 5. Mat. 7. 7. Luke, 11. 13. Iam. 1. 5.
2. As also for our Teachers and Instructors that God would give them utterance,
that they may speak as they ought. Ephesians. 6. 19. 20 Col. 4. 3. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 1.
Heb. 13. 18. 4 To dispatch, with all effectual care and providence, all
necessary business, and put-by vnnecessaries, that we or ours be not hindered
from coming or timely coming: but that we with our housholdes may serve God.
Ios. 24. 15. To this end the Householder must get fit servants. Psalm 101. 6. and
command them. Genesis 18. 19.
2 In the exercise; both before and after noone: that thou may give to Christ
all his own day. Psalm. 92. 1. 2. Esa. 58. 13. 1 To come at the beginning to
join to the present exercises: and there continewe to the end, thou and thine.

16. 19. Luke 1. 21. 1. King 8, 54. 55. 2 Such behavior as becomes Saints:
tends to edification: and is guided by the rule of decency. 1. Cor. 11. 13.
and 14. 26. 40. Ephesians. 5. 3. 4. Namely: 1 Head uncovered, and knee and body
bowed: 1. Corin. 11. 7. 25. Neh. 8. 6. Leuit. 9. 24. Acts. 9. 40. and 20. 36. 2
Lifting up the heart at the public prayers; to say Amen unto them: Neh. 8. 6.
1. Cor. 14. 16. 3 To note with pen the doctrines, or with the Bible to
observe the division, coherence, doctrine, uses and proofs. Act. 17. 11. To
the end thou may eschew sleep: and wandering thoughts; and so to hear with
understanding, delight, and profit. 1. Cor. 14. 15. 16. 19. and 6. 20. and 10.
15. Esa. 58. 13. Luke 8. 18.

3 After the exercise of the fore and after noon, we must be careful of these:
viz. 1 Sobriety of meat and drink, and careful temperance above all other
times: that the body may be strengthened and better disposed to the duties of
godliness; not over burdened and made unapt to remember, meditate, confer,
or hearken and give heed. 1. Cor. 11. 21. 29. 30. Mat. 10. 1. 2. Romans 14. 17.
Luke 21. 34. 2 Holy conference with other: either 1 By occasion at the table:
whether of the things delivered that day by the Preacher: or else of some other
good matter ministered: avoiding the common rock (vvhereupon men stumble) of
profane and worldly talk: remembering the rule. Esa. 58. 13. Luke 14. 1. 7. 8.
9. 10. 11. 12. 15. 16. 2 By purpose and intention: calling our family together
and examining them: or joining to other like minded Christians, and mutually

So much of the duties of Piety.

*2. The works of Mercy and necessity concerning either: 1 God and his
worship: so it is lawful on the Sabbath* 1 For Kings and Magistrates, to
cleanse the Church of Idolatry. 2. King. 11. 15. 16. 18. 2 For the Priests of
the old Testament, and Ministers of the Gospel, to do such necessary
business as tends to the worship of God. Mat. 12. 5. 3 For a Minister in
teaching, or Christians in hearing, to ouer-watch themselves and to break

which may be prevented by our help. Matthew 12. 11. Luke 13. 15. and 14. 5. 6
Generally any good deed or moral duty, to do well on a Sabbath is a
Sabbath days duty. Matthew 12. 2. Mark. 3. 4.

Negative: Things not to be done, but carefully avoided, as profaning the
Sabbath: in causing to break Gods Commandments. Namely, all sin either in
nature or circumstances, Esa. 56. 2: Either committed against

1 The first Table: as 1 To seek, or to do our own will or ways. Esa. 58.
13. 2 Idolatry. Ezech: 20. 24. and 23. 37. 38. 3 Hypocrisy. Luke 13. 15. 4
Disobedience to God even in a light matter. Ex. 20. 10. Numb. 15. 32. 35. 5 An

16.
8 All things that hinder the worship of God, or any part thereof: as prayer,
the preaching or hearing of Gods word, the receiving of the Sacraments: (except
it be in a case of a necessary work of mercy, with out the which our selves or
others cannot be, or not well be by any longer delay of time.) Ex. 16. 23. 24.
26 29. and 35. 3. and 15. 32. 35. Of these kind of unlawful hindrances are; 1
The ordinary labors of our week days calling: Exodus 20. 9. Ier. 17. 22. 24.
Leuit. 23. 3. 8. 2 Harvest work, or bearing of burdens. Neh. 13. 15. Ier. 7.

buying victuals.) Neh. 13. 16. In which cases providence would be required
before, and repentance, with amendment of our negligence after. 4 Traveling
on the Sabbath for gain or pleasure. Exodus 16. 29. 30.

contention. Esa. 58. 3. 4. 5 Vain words. Esa. 58. 13.

So much of the public sanctifying of the Sabbath.

The private sanctifying of the Christian Sabbath, is performed privately and
by private persons; namely, when Christians can by no means enjoy the benefit
of the public means: which case because it is a judgment and heavy plague of
God, both by withdrawing light, and leaving us in darkness: Christians in this
estate are to observe these rules:

1 To be greatly humbled and to mourn, for absence from the Church assemblies,
Communion of Saints, and means of spiritual nourishment, direction and
comfort: as also in respect of the profanations of Gods Sabbaoths by the
wicked. Psalm. 42. 4. and 120. 5. and 137. 4. 5. Lam. 1. 7. and 2. 6. Psalm. 119.
136. 2 To long for earnestly and hunger with zealous and continual desire of
mind, after the fruition and enjoying of so great a benefit. Psalm. 42. 2. and
84. 1. 2. 3. 4. 10. 3 To use all possible good means to come by the public
ordinances of God upon the Sabbath: and esteem it as a rich benefit, worthy
of all endeavor to obtain it 1 By earnest entreaty and careful suit unto the
Magistrates and governors, by whose authority they are permitted and
encouraged; as also to the Teachers themselves. Act. 13. 42. Io. 4. 40. Ier. 38
9. 10. and 26. 17. 18. 19. 1. King. 22. 8. Exodus 5. 1. Neh. 1. 11. and 2. 3. 4.
5. 6. 7. 8. 2 By fervent and continual prayer unto God, the Lord of the
harvest, both to thrust out faithful laborers into his harvest; as also to
make us especially partakers of the same. Mat. 9. 38. and 24. 20. Psalm. 27. 4.
3 By kind entreating, encouraging, defending and maintaining of the godly
learned Preacher: and so to purchase to our selves this pearl or treasure and
that gift of God unto his Church for the gathering of the Saints, and
edification of the body of Christ: Ephesians. 4. 12. Heb. 13. 17. Gal. 6. 6. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12. 13. 1. Cor. 9. 7. 8. 11. 13. 14. Matthew. 10. 10. 11. 14. 40. 41.
and 13. 44. 45. 46. Proverb. 23. 23. Else, where the duty is omitted, a just
and heavy judgment follows. Hebr. 3. 17. Mark. 3. 5. Matthew. 16. 4. and 8.
34. Act. 13. 46. and 19. 19. 4 By seeking with great hunger and fervent desire,
and travailing abroad (how-euer painful or costly it may prove) to redeem
and enjoy this benefit: Remembering that is a Sabbaoths day journey to worship
God and to hear a Sermon. 1. King. 4. 23. Amos 8. 11. Dan. 12. 4. Prou. 8. 33.
and 2. 4. 5. Act. 1. 12. and to suffer much affliction to enjoy this blessing
1. These. 1. 6. Matthew. 12. 42.
4 To use and put in practice all the means within our power, that are
commanded of God, or practiced by the godly: wherein we are carefully 1 To
double our private diligence in the absence of the public means. 2 To
observe as carefully the whole day, both fore and afternoon, as if the
public means were present: considering the perpetual equity of these
Commandments. Ex. 20. 8. 9. 10. Esa. 58. 30. 1. Cor. 16. 1. 2. Psalm 92. 1.
2. The private practice of the Lords day is either performed, 1 With others: as
in a family: or consent of practice by willing and united Christians: in which
cases are required a spending of the day, in 1 Examination, instruction, and
Catechism. Deuteronomy. 6. 7. 20. 21. and 11. 19. Genesis 18. 19. Ephesians. 6. 4. 2
Conference and godly questioning and answering. Luke 24. 14. 17. 18. Col. 4. 6.
3 Prayer, with thanksgiving and praise. Mat. 18. 20. yea with fasting, on fit
occasions. 1. Sam. 31. 13. Hest. 4. 16. 4 Singing of Psalms. Act. 16. 25. Ephesians.
5. 19. 5 Reading of Scriptures. Act. 17. 11. Malac. 3. 16. 6 Deeds and duties
of mercy, collections, visitings, comfortings. Matt. 25. 34. 35. 36. 37. 38.
39. 40.
2 With our selves alone: as in a case of traveling, imprisonment, hard
service, or slavery: in which later cases we are by humble entreaty to seek


Liberty of sanctifying the Lords day. Herin are required these things, or so
much as is within our power, all or the most:

1 Meditation of our sins: Gods word and works of wisdom, power, Justice,
mercy, state of the Church to rejoice or grieve at it, according as it is.
Psalm. 119. 58. Psalm. 92. 5. 6. 9. 12. 13. and 1. 2. 2 Prayer, and
thanksgiving unto GOD. Matt. 6. 6. James 5. 13. Genes. 24. 63. 1. These. 5. 17.
18. Col. 3. 17. 3 Singing Psalms: Iam. 5. 13. Psalm. 57. 7. and 77. 6. Luke 2.
46. 4 Reading of the Scriptures. Joshua 1. 8. Colossians, 3. 16. 5 Works of
mercy, according to our power, and fit occasion. 2. Cor. 8. 12. Mark. 12. 41.
42. 43. 44. 6 To join prayer with fasting (if need be) to be humbled for
sins or judgment: or to farther prayer for our necessities. Neh. 1. 4. Dan.
9. 3.
So much of the private sanctifying of the Christian Sabbath.

Motives, reasons, and encouragements to the cheerful and faithful
observation of the Lords day or Christian Sabbath: and deterring us from the
profanation of the same; both in respect of

1 Blessings obtained. 2 Escaping judgments.
1 Blessings and promises obtained. 1 Concerning the life to come. 1 Private:
urged to persons in private: 1 It is a good work. Psalm. 92. 1. 2 Sabbath
exercises, commanded of God, are blessed and sanctified unto us of God. Exodus
20. 10. Genesis 2. 2. and a means of our sanctification. Exodus 31. 13. Ezech. 20.
12. 3 Gods acceptance of our Prayer and obedience in sanctifying it. Esa. 56.
8. 4 Planting us in his Church, as flourishing plants. Esa. 56. 7. Psalm. 92.
13. 5 An heart to delight in God. Esa. 58. 14. 6 Joy of the holy Ghost. Esa.
56. 7. 7 Assurance and security of Gods election. Esa. 56. 3. 4. 8 Salvation
and blessedness. Esa. 56. 2. and 58. 14.
2 Public: The flourishing of the Church of God. Ierem. 17. 26. Leuit. 26. 2.
11. 12.
2 Concerning this life. 1 Public. A flourishing Commonwealth with other
temporal and earthly blessings; To the Kings, Nobles, subjects and whole
estate. Ier. 1 Leui. 26* 6. 7.
2 Private: It gains us, and ours, lawful rest of mind and body from the
pains and labors of our calling. Exodus 20. 10. and 23. 12. Deuteronomy. 5. 14.

2 Curses, plagues and judgments following the profaning of the Sabbath,
which (by observing it) we do escape. Herein we are to consider, touching
the profaning of the Lords Sabbath by negligence or wilfulness, 1 What it
brings: 1 The guilt of a great and grievous sin: to violate the
constitution and practice of the inspired Apostles. 1. Corin. 16. 1. 2. Act.
20. 7. To forget that which God bids remember: to profane that which he bids
keep holy; to labor in that day which he bids rest: to unhallow that which he
blessed. Exodus 20. 8. 9. 10. 11. Ezech. 22. 26. 2 It is an heavy punishment of
God, and a punishment of Idolatry and false Prophets; for God to give us over
to profane his Sabbaoths. Hos. 2. 5. 11. Lamentations 2. 6. 14. 3 It brings
Gods great plague, and increases wrath and guilt upon the Magistrate, people,
and whole estate of the Commonwealth. Neh. 13. 18. Ier. 17. 27. Ezec. 20. 13.
Namely: 1 Sickness. Leuit. 26. 2. 16. 2 Famine. Leuit. 26. 2. 16. 19. 20. 26.

5 The bodily death, for the breach of the Ceremonial, did figure unto us the
death of the soul for the breach of the Moral part of the Sabbath. For the

2 What it makes and marketh men to be in the eyes of God: 1 Generally in all
sorts. 2 Particularly in the Clergy.


1 In the people and all persons whatsoever: 1 They are not of God which keep
not his Sabbath. Io. 9. 16. 2 They are fools and unwise that do profane and
not sanctify the Sabbath. Psalm. 92. 1. 6. 3 Unbelievers, vagabond and wicked
fellows are enemies and hinderers of the sanctifying of the Sabbath. Acts 17.
5. 17. 4 They are Hypocrites that are offended at the keeping holy of the
Sabbath. Luke 13. 14. 15. 5 They are enemies of God and of his Church, that
mock at the Sabbath of the Lord. Lam. 1. 7. 6 They are such as judge
themselves unworthy of everlasting life, that do hinder or persecute the
sanctifying of the Sabbath day. Acts 13. 45. 46. 50.
2 In the Clergy and spiritual sort. 1 It arises of gross and wilful
ignorance in the Clergy, if they do not rightly sanctify the Sabbath of God;
and deserves just reproof. Matt. 12. 3. 5. 7. 2 They are a wicked Clergy and
utterly disliked and reproved by God, that hide their faces from keeping the
Lords Sabbath holy, and so profane it. Ezec. 22. 26. and 46. 2. Hos. 4. 6.

MATTHEW 12. 8. The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
