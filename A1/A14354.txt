is added. A Sermon made of the confessing of Christ and his gospel / and of
the denyinge of the same.

sins / that ye receive not of her plagues. In this furst treatise theys
things ar contained.
1 The question of Cohabitacion. 2 Christians may not be present at popish
masses and supersticions. 3 The mass is a prophanacio^ of the lords supper 4
The duty of princes is to mayntain pure Religion among there subjects / and
what inferior Rulars must do when they be commanded contra rye by their
superiors. 5 A confutacion of the reasons which are made to prove the
Cohabitacion lawful. 6 How the Iues ar to be handeled of christians. 7 The
papists ar heretics.
Whether the dwellinge toge there and familiar conversation of the godly with
the godles / the faithful with the faythles / the professor of Christ's
gospel with the papiste be lawful or no.
THe reasons by which many do persuade them selves / and others also / that yt
is lawful / Reasons proving that it is lavvfull.
for the faithful to have famylier conversation / and to dwell together with
the unfaithful, are these.

1 Christ Jesus did go unto the feasts and dyners of publicans and sinners /
and was there ac companyed and famyliarlie conuersaunte with them. In like
manner being bydden of the phariseis to dyners / he went.

2 Also S. Paul does bid / that the faithful whi 1. Cor. 7.
^he is joined in marriage with the unbeliever shol ^e not be separated / if the
unbeliever will dwell wi ^he the faithful.

3 Again he teaches / if any of them which bele^e 1: Cor. 10.
not bid you to a feast / and if ye will go / what ^oeuer is set before you /
that eat / rc. In an other ^lace he likewise sayethe: I wrote unto you in an
epi 1. Cor. 5.
^le / that ye should not company with fornicatours. And I meant not at all
of the fornicatours of this world / or of the covetous / or of extorsioners /
or of the Idolatrors / for then must ye neades have gone out of the world.
But now I have written unto you / that ye company not together. If any that
is called a brother / be a fornicatour / or covetous / or a worshipper of
Images / or a rayler / or a drunkard / or an extorsioner / with him that is
such / see that ye eat not.

altogether ungodly and wicked Idolatrours / that is / in the land of Canaan /
and in Egypt.

familiar company of Abraham / and did chose to dwell among the Sodomytes.

6 Naaman the Sirian 4. Reg. 5.
/ after that he was healed of his leprosy / did return to his Idolatrous
nation.

7 Christ our Savior did not reteyne with him all Marc. 5.
those whom he did heal / but commanded some of the^ to return unto their
own famyliars / countryme^ / and kinsfolks (which yet were wicked / and
infidels) among whom they should publishe and declare / what the lord hade
done for them.

8 The Iues both by the civil and canon laws are not only permitted to live
among the christians / but also to have their synagoges: and tribute is taken
of them.

9 Some heretics have liberty given them by civil laws / to dwell among
the faithful: for the laws do not apoynte them all to be punished by death.
We read that the Nouatians hade their Churches and congregations / permitted
in Constantinople / in the time of Constantine the great / and Theodosius /
which were most godly Emperors.


These are the reasons by which many do persuade them selves and others /
thatyt is lawful for the godly and faithful / to dwell together and to have
familiar conversation with the wicked and unfaithful /

To prove that their persuasions are false and The disposition of the Tretise.
untruly gathered of these places / I must propounde certain divisions: which
being done / I shall put forth certain propositions or sentences In the
prouinge of which to be true / ye shall plain lie perceive how these places
alleged / are abused of them to maynteyne their falfe opinion.

First / I must divide between the estates and The furst Diui^ion
sorts ofmen: Some sorts ofmen / are Magistra tes and rulers: some other be
subjects and of the comen sort of people. The second Division


The second division shall be of cohabitation or dwelling together / of which one
kind is free / that is / where men be not compelled to co^munica te with
wicked superstitions / ungodly rites and Idolatries.

An other kind of cohabitation / or dwellinge together there is which is not
free / and that is when remen are compelled to communicate with wicked
supersticions / to be present at Idolatries / and so to defyle them selves.

The third division shall be of the godly and faith The thread division.
full men them selves / which are thus familiarlie conuersaunte with the
unbelievers. Either they are learned strong and able to confess the doctrine
of truithe in religion / and to reprove and co^umce the false: orels they are
unlearned / weak / and unable to stand in the confession of the truithe / and
reprouinge of untruth.

These three divisions shall suffice. Now will I put forth certain sentencis
and propositions. The first sentence and proposition / shall be of those which
in estate and condicyon are private me^ and subjects: Of that cohabitatio^ and
dwellinge whi che is free. And of those men which are learned and strong: of
all which I make this proposition.

Private men and subjects / which are learned and strong / dwellinge in that
place where they be The fvrst proposition.
free and not compelled to communicate with wic ked supersticions / they may
be famyliarlie conuer saunte / dwell and live together with the unbelievers This
may they do / but yet under certain co^ditio^s / and obseruinge certain rules.

Of which the first is this / that they do teach those unbelievers with whom
they do live and are 1 Rules to bekept.
familiarlie conuersaunte / and do instruct them in the truithe / truly
teachinge them and earnestly calling them / unto the knowledge of the truithe
/ and faith in Christ. And this they must not leave of to do so long as
they be dwellinge and fami liar with them. To the end also that they may do
this the better / yt is not unlawful / but most convenient for them to show
them selves friendly / ge^ till / and louinge unto the vnbeleauers with who^
they are familiarlie conuersaunte / and dwellinge / So that these may
perceive that the faithful do love the^: else is yt to be feared that they
shall do no good with them. for that doctrine is most redylie received of the
hearer / which comes from him / of whom the hearer is persuaded / that he is
his friend / and that he louithe him indeed.

The second thing that the faithful must take heed of / and Rule which they
must observe is this: 2
That they do live an holy life / and that among the vnbeleauers their
conversation be so godly / grave / comely / and agreing with their profession /
that in no wise they do give any offense through the wickedness of their lyfel:
for if by their life the unfaithful should be offendid / then should their my
nistery be unprofitable to the unbelievers / for that by their evil doings they
should overthrow what soever they labored to build up in words.

The thread thing that these men must take heed 3
of / and Rule which they must observe is. That they do not communicate / with
the unfaithful in their supersticio^s and jdolatries / nor iet do so mutch as
outwardly to seame to allow them. This is not to be done in any wise / no not
in hope thereby to win the vnbeleauer from his supersticion / and Idolatry:
For this Rule of the holy ghost To. 3
does ever remain certain / Evil things are not to be done / that good may
comme thereof. This unchangeable rule must not be broken.

The fourth and last thing that these men must 4
take heed of / and Rule which they must obseru^e is this. That they have not
there familiar conuersacio^ with the unbelievers for their own cause / as for
their pleasure and recreacion / or for their gayn and profit / but only in
respect of winning them to the gospel of christ. Neither is this
conversation and company / contynually to be hadd and kept with the ungodly
and unbelievers / but so long as there is good hoope of wynninge / and
converting the^ to the^ gospel of christ. For if the vnbeleauers shall show
themselves so obstinate in their evil / that they give just cause to despair
of there amen dement / then ar they utterly to be forsaken / and no conversation
or company is to be hadd with them / farther the^ the necessity of life
enforcith either par tie. As yff the vnbeleauers should be in such extreme
necessity / that they could not be releaued but at the hand of the faithful:
or if these should be in that necessity / that they could not otherwise obtain
things necessary but of the unfaithful. Also in byinge and selling things
necessary for the life / as garments / victuals / and such like: Again in
such things as cyuile estates / and conditions do require / as of princes and
Rulars to demand lawful defense / and to obey them in things lawful: to
fathers / married folk / masters / and such like / to do those duties which are
appointed in godds word. In these things to use the vnbeleauers / or to
minister unto them / is not unlawful.

Thus and in this manier / yt is lawful for a pri uate man / which is learned /
and constant in godds trui the / being in that place where no man is compelled
to be partaker of wicked supersticions / to dwell together / and use familiar
conversation with the un beleuers and unfaithful / as these named Rules and
conditions / do appoint and suffer. And so have ye this proposicio^ declared
and opened / The same is confirmed / by the example of Christ our Sa uiour. He
did resort to the dyners / and feasts / where scribes and pharisees /
publicanes and sinners were / to this end only / even to teach them and to
win them unto the Gospel. So says hierom. The lord did go unto the
feasts of sinners Hiero in Matt. cap. 9.
that he might have occasion to teach them and that he might give spiritual
meats to them which did bydde him: and after speaking how christ went often to
feasts / Theare is (says he) no other thing reported / but what he did /
and what he taught there. That both the humblenes of the ^orde in goinge to
sinners / and the power of his doctrine in conuertinge the penitents / might
be declared.

After the same manner / the prophets in the old ^yme were conuersaunte with
the Idolatrous peo ple. So were the Apostles famyliarlie conuersaun te with the
unbelieving Iues / and went also emo^ gest other unbelieving nations and men. S.
Paul Act. 17.
when he came to Athens / did not think skorne so famyliarlie to behave him
self that he went in to the temples of their Idols / and very curiously
searched the corners of the same / he did view their altars / the titles and
inscriptions of there altars / so that he found owte that title / Ignoto Deo
which was an altar dedicated unto the unknown God / whereof he did take
occacion to make that same his sermon in which he preached Christ unto them
even as yt were out of their own books.

And thus / I think / that this our proposition / (which of yt own self is
plain and evident ynou ghe) is sufficiently proved. Namely this / that a
private man / learned / and constaunte in the truithe / being in that place
where no man is compel led to communicate with wicked supersticions / may be
familiarlie conuersante with the unbelievers / so long as in his conversation
he does observe and keep / the conditions before mentioned. Conversation vuith
men excommunicate.
Here I think good to add / as yt were by the way of admonicion / that
kepinge these rules and conditions / yt is lawful for the godly to be
conuersaunte with them which be excommunicate / even to call them in to the
way of godlynes / and not to communicate with them in any evil or sin. The
secu^d proposition.
Now will I put forth an other proposition or sentence / which shall be of
those persons which be of a private estate and are subjects / of that
cohabitacion which is fre where no man is compelled to communicate with wicked
supersticions / and of such men as be unlearned in the knowledge of gods
truithe / weak in faith / and therefore unable to make a christian confession
of truithe. This collection agrees with that which I gathered before / of
which I made my former proposition / sauinge that whereas there / with the
private estate and free dwellinge / I coupled men that were lear Ignorance in
men is intolerable.
ned and strong to confess the truithe / hear I do add in the place of them
/ men unlearned / unable / and to weak to confess the truithe. But herin thin
cke not that I do allow such ignorance and una blenes in men. Such
ignorance in men is sharply to be reproved / for there is none so ueri an
idiote / so simple and unlearned among Christianes / but he is bound in
conscience to be able to render an account of his faith / and also to be
somewhat able to teach and instruct others / yea and to say somewhat for the
truth / in all the principal points of the christian faith / which he may
do if he be but meanly instructed in the Catechism. But because / partly
through the perverseness of the ministers which do not their office to instruct
men / partly through the negligence of men which do not their duty in
seekinge to be instructed / such ig noraunce there is / I admytt therefore into
this my collection those ignoraunte / unable / and weak men. And so I make
this proposition. Those men which are of a private estate and condition /
dwellinge or being in a place where they be not compelled to communicate with
wicked supersticions. And are themselves unlearned and unable to con fesse and
defend the truithe / may not use famyliar conversation with the unbelievers.

These men are not in that condition that the lear ned be / of whom I did speak
before / for they cannot teach the unbelievers / yea they be not able to
defend the gospel of christ from the blasphemy of the unbelievers / neither
can they deliver them sell ues from such false snares as the vnbeleauers shall
lay for the^: Wherefore they must not have familiar conuersacio^ with them /
through which they shall thus throw themselves into peril / and ieoperdie:
Except that they can assure themselves of such stre^ghth / that they shall not
yealde unto the wickedness of the unbelievers. Otherwise / if they shall happen
to dwell together in one place with the un faithful: Let the^ take good
heed that they do ly ue an holy life among the^: And for the rest / let the^
so far as the necessity of life / and civil businesses and affairs shall
suffer them / utterly abstayn from the company of the vnbeleauers.

But here risith a question: Whether that such a A ques^tion.
weak and unlearned man / may learn any of the liberal arts / or
philosophy / of such a master as is an vnbeleauer.

Unto which I answer: that forbicause to lern such arts of an unfaithful
master is not of such necessity as can not be avoided / therefore the man that
is weak in faith must not lern them of him. Yt is a very daungerus thing /
to use them which are vnbeleauers as Masters and teachers: for often times in
the minds of the hearers there arisith a great admiracion and estimacio^ of the
teacher / and it may easilye com to pas at the le^ghthe / that they shall
think and Judge that these teachers are not deceived in Religion / because
they be of an exact and perfect knowledge in these liberal sciences / and
philosophy. This (I say) may happen of it that men ar wont to attribute mutch
unto their teachers. Yea that it may be so / I will prove by the co^ trarie.
Origin by teaching the Mathematicalls / and such sciences / did bring many me^
to the know ledge of christ. For furst he did begin to read among them such
sciences with which they were de lighted / In which he being expert / did show
unto his hearers such conning / that he did forthewith get among them great
estimacion / and so the more easili draw them unto the doctrine of christ.
Augustine likewise came to Millaine / to here Ambrose / because he was counted
an ex cellent Rhetorician. And so whilst he desiru sly herd him / at the
lenghth by hearing he was turned form the sect of the Manichees / unto the
true catholics. As therefore by lerning of these sciences of godly teachers /
the vnbeleauers have been con uerted unto the faith of christ / even so /
yea mutch more easily it may come to pas / that they which are wea^e and
unlearned / may under vnbeleauinge masters / be drawn from christ to
ungodliness. Wherefore seeing that this can not be done without great peril and
danger / that such a weakling should use an unfaithful Master / I think that
he should abstayn altogether from such.

Sum do here object and say / that S. Paul to the Corinthians does appoint no
such Rule condi cion nor exception / as I have spoken of / unto the weak and
unlearned: but he plainly says. If any of them which beleaue not / do bidd you
to a feast / (...) Cor. 10.
and if ye will go / whatsoever is set before you that eat / ^c. In which
words he teachith / that it is left unto our own will as a fre thing to go /
or not to go. I answer / that'ye must marcke well those words of Paul / (and
if ye will go.) He does not How they se words, and if ye will go, ar to be
vnderstonded.
grant unto every man's will this liberty / and fredom / but unto a good and a
right will he gyuith liberty to go. For if a man would go thither to drin cke
droncken / glotonusly to fill the belly / or to give the tongue to filthy and
uncomely talk / without doubt that man should syn / even for the wickedness of
his will / and for his corrupt intent* and purpose. Even so / if a man dowbted
his own strenghth / and did certainly perceive that he could not profi te them
that should be there / and yet would go thither / vndowbtedly with a safe
conscience and with a good will he could not take that thing in hand / for he
can not direct his doing to the glory of godd / as he is commanded to do.
Wherefore though ^aul expressly does not add that rule / yt folowith not
therefore / that yt is not to be added: yea that ^t is to be added I will prove
by other places of the scripture. And to thend that we do not herin de ^art
from Paul / the same thing / and doctrine of will / he teachith in the. 7.
chapter of the same epistle: where he entreating of gyuyng or not gyuing^ 1.
Cor. 7.
(...) virgin to marriage says / That he does well which ^eapith his virgin /
and that purposith it sure ^y in his heart / (addinge this condition) having no
^eade / but has pour over his own will: For if he ^huld do it otherwise then
his daughter either wol ^e / or then her necessity required / then should he
nei ^her will / nor do well. Thus to do a good work / ^r to make an act
prefect / yt sufficithe not to take ^eede that it be not evil of nature / or
repugnant unto gods word / but unto this is also required / that we do go
about the same with an upright and ^erfect mind and will. S. Paul / therefore /
does not ^mply permit this going / but with certain circumstances. Which are /
to go with a good will to ^nstruct the unfaithful: Again to go with an
assured purpose / not to be, and taste of such stre^ghthe / that he shall not
be ouerthrown. And thus this proposicion remaynith true / that the man which
^s weak and unlearned / must separate himself from the company and famyliar
conversation of the vnbeleauers / so mutch as cyuile and natural businesses
and affairs will suffer / and as the necessi^e of life shall require (as I
said before). Likewise all household duties and offices appointed in gods word
must be observed / else shall he offend / for as Paul says: He that prouidith
not for his / and 1. Timo. 5.
especially for them of his own how should / the same has denied the faith /
and is wors then an Infidel. And to prove farther / that this unlearned and
weak man must abstayn from the familiar company of the vnbeleauers / yea
though they be most dear unto him / that Rule does serve / which Matt. 5. 18.
Christ our Savior gyuithe saying. If thy hand or foot offend the / and
hinder the / cut yt of / and cast yt from the / ^c. If thyn eye offend the /
pluck yt out / and cast yt from the. We are not commanded in this place / to
cut of the outward members of our body / as Origin (if it be true that sum do
re port of hyme) did untruly think / but as the sownd interpretours do write
/ those friends and things / which are most nighe and dear unto us / These ar
they which must be cut of plucked out / and cast away from our familiarity
and company / when they do pluck / and separate us / from the true way of
salvation / or be such a hinderaunce unto us as puttinge impedimentes and
lettes in our way / do hinder us from walking in gods law. Chrisostom
entreating this matier / writithe. If the membre which is misioined unto the
body In Joan. hom. 15.
must be cut of / are not then evil friends mutch more to be cut of* And again /
he says / If we do cut of that membre which is rotten / and incurable from the
body / for fear les yt should corrupt the other parts thereof / (which we do
not because we do neglect it / for who yet did ever hate his own flesh, but to
save the rest) how mutch more is this to be done to them which are evil joined
unto us* Which yet we must not do as though we did despise the^ / but to
provide that our health and salvation be not brought in danger by the^* after
that we do see that we can not profit them at all. To this also belo^gith the
law which christ did give: Matthew. 1^.
That he which will not here the brethern admonishing him / And does contemn
the voice of the church when it reprouith / and correctith him: he is then to
be esteemed and taken as an ethnicke / and a publicane. Which thing Paul
puttith in practice when he biddith / that the Corinthians should ex communicate
the fornicator / les that a litill leaue^ 1. Cor. 5.
should sour the whole lump of dowe. To the same purpose he usith the vearse
of the poet Menander. Evil words do corrupt good maniers. There 1. Cor. 15.
Paul teachith / that the true doctrine of the Resurrection was greatly
hindered among the ^orinthians / which were but newly turned unto christ /
because they did to lightly give ear to the ungod ly arguments and reasons of
philosophers / or ra there of heretics / which did contend and strive against
that doctrine. No man can sufficiently consider / how the bewitching of wicked
tales / and ^alkes / do shake and hurt the tender conscience and weak faith /
of the foeble and weak brother. Where ^or it is most necessari and profitable
to admonis he them which are weak / that they do abstayn / and withdraw them
selves / from the felowshipp and familiar company / of the vnbeleauers. The
phi sicions / do cowncell (...) when a contagius disease has enfected any nigh
place / that they which as yet ar sownd and not enfected / should not come unto
them that be enfected already and sick / because that in the bodies of men /
and the temperatures / and disposicions of the same / there is such a common
passion and suffering / that the infection does easily go from the^ that be
infected / unto the other. And though they which do not take heed and keape
the^ selves from that infection / do not presently feale the poison and force
thereof / yeat inasmutch as by lytill and litill the infection / and poison
received does grow / not long after they are sure to feale the force and
strenghthe of it. Seeing this is so / and cich man may worthily and godly take
heed to avoid the diseases of the body / mutch more dilligent heed is to be
taken of all men / that they do not from any man or place get unto themselves
infecting vices of the mind. Our Nature / and disposicio^ through our natural
and birthe syn is now so cor rupt / (as both the holy scripture does warn us /
and infinite examples of daily experience do teach us) that we neade not to
dowt at all / but that we shall easily receive the poison / and infectio^ of
other men's sins / if we do not fle far from them: And as with no great
labor they will cleave unto us / so after they be ons crept and roted into us
/ the^ hard ly and not without great pain and labor / will they be thrust out
again. Wherefore Chrisostom in the before in Ioe^m. hom. ^6.
named place semith to say well. If (says he speaking of the vnbeleauers and
wicked) we could make them better / and not hurt our selves / all things were
to be done: But when we can not pro fite them / because they be incurable /
and such as will not be amended / and yet we hurt our selves / they are utterly
to be cut of. And to the end that he might the more strongly confirm his
saying / he alledgith that saying of Paul: Put away the evil 1. Cor. 5.
from among you. Which words of Paul are not to be vnderstonded of the sin
/ for the greek word is in the masculyne gendre / (...) / and therefore he
meanith by it / the wicked man. The same words I will now sumwhat bend / use /
and turn / unto the profit of you that be weak / and thus say unto you. Put
away your own selves from the evil men that are emongst you: for seeing ye ar
but private men / and unlearned / and therefore can not put away the evil from
among you / yet your selves ye may ridd / and convey away from being emongst
the wicked / and the evil men.

Morouer it happens that whilst the weak and unlearned do thus familiarly
accompany the vnbealeuers / They ca^ not chose but they must hear many
subtle reasons and see many other things which do mutch make against the true
religion that they do profes: Which things when they se and be not able to
disprove and confute / They do it not: And so they ro^ne into two mischeifs.
The furst is / That they are as it were witnesses of the blasphemy / and of the
reproach that the vnbeleauers do to the truithe: The second / that they may
happ to have sum stinge left sticking in their concience / with which they
shall be longer / more greuusly and daungerusly tormented / the^ either they
think of or do fear. Let us here therefore the wise man which does say. Who
so touchithe pitche shall be fie Eccles. 13.
led there with all / and he that is familiar with the proud / shall become
like unto him: Take not a burden upon the / above thy pour / neither join
thou thy felf to him that is more honorable / and ritche then thiself. These
words of the wiseman / do for two causes belong to our purpos. Furst / because
that they do teach / that other men's sins ar like unto pitche / which does
stycke unto the fingars and garments of them that do touch it. Again / that
eich man should well try and consider his own pour and strenghth. Upon which
cowncell / I do gather two things. Furst / that the infirm and weak must not
ioyn themselves in familia ritie with the wicked / for wickedness will then clea
ue unto them: Secondly that eich man must so well consider / and justly try
his own pour and strenghth / that he does not ouermatch himself.

The church of godd in all ages has felt by expe rience that mutch evil
has happened through this familiar company / and felowshipp keapt between
the weak in faith and knowledge / and the vnbeleauers. In the Primitive
church forthwith after christ's ascension / because the Iues which were
converted unto christ did live a great while with those gentiles which hadd
received the gospel / there begone a very Iuishnes. For the Iues did enforce the
ceremonies of Moses law / myng ling the^ with the doctrine of the gospel /
through which they did infect many congregacions of the christians so sore /
that scarsely and hardely at le^ghth could that evil be roted out: Yea that
evil has so prevailed / that even until our times / in Spayn namely / and in
sum other places also / there be many which do not only hold still the
ceremonies of Moses law with the profession of christ / but they do think
them to be necessary unto Salvation. They emongst the Spaniards which be of
this mind / ar called Marrani. And unto this day the church of India is
enfected with the same vice. But let the examples of the holy scripture / I
pray you / teach us even the same. The Israelites which were captyues in
Babylon / by the space of 70. years / when they hadd liberty given them furst
of Cyrus / then of Darius / those two most noble Kings to return / they did not
all forthewith return / but a great number of the^ / such namely as were weaker
in the lord the^ other / being delighted with the commodities and pleasures of
their houses / feildes / and traffic of merchandise / did abide still amon ge
the chaldees: ^ich men how sharply they were reproved of Esdras / Nehemias /
Zacharias / and other prophets / it does plainly appear in the scripture to
them that list to seake and know it. How the Israelites were infected through
that conversation which they hadd with the Egiptia^s / it appearith plainly by
this / that whilst they were in the desert / when as yet the wonderful
benefits of godd were even before there eyes / they did fall from the lord their
dilyuerer unto Idolatry / and unto that kind of Idolatry / which they were
acquaynted with all in Egipte. There they hadd seen how the Egiptians
worshipped an Ox / they therefore violently travailed with Aaron when Moses was
Exodus 23.
absent / that he should make the^ a calf to worshipp: which when he hadd done
/ the^ began they ioyously to cry: These ar thy godds / O. Israel / which
brought the out of the land of Egypt. Again / when by the desert wild and
barren places / they were comme to the coasts of the Moabites / and be Numer.
15.
began to wax more familiar with them then became the poeple of godd / through
that familiarity they were brought to this / that not only they did co^ mitt
most vile whordom with those beastly women / but also that they sacrificed unto
their most shameful Idol / Baal peor / and suffered themselves to be coupled
unto his sacrifices. for which they suffered many miseries and calamities. Peter
likewise / Math. 26.
when he ca^me into that wicked court of the chief pressed and was there
conversant emongst those dam sels and ungodly servants / most miserably did he
deny and forswear his master christ our Savior: which his fault / after he
departed from thence / he did bewail with abundaunce of tears. By the se
histories ye may plainly see / what happenith un to the weak through that
familiar conversation which they have with the unfaithful. Esaye the pro Esaiae
6.
phet / when he did se the lord sitting upon his sea te of glory / with his
Angels about him most pure ly publishing his praise / though he semith not to
think himself greatly gyltie of any notable crime or fault / yet cries he
out / O woe is me / (...). I dwell among a poeple that has unclean lyppes.
This man of godd truly did think / that he hadd gotton no small corruption
and infection / by cause he hadd lived long with an unclean poeple.

The histories of the heathen do teach us the same thing. Alexander that great
and mighty king of Macedonia / who by the force of arms / and most notable
victories / hadd subdued the greatest part of the whole world / Even he
himself was ouercomme with the maniers of the Persians. And upon whom of right
/ as upon a conquered poeple / he should have laid laws / to have brought
them to that severe kind of life which the Macedo nians used / even he as a
man co^querred and ouerco^me of there maniers / suffered himself to be so shame
fully misused / that he did take unto him their kind of array / their lewse
delicacie / their pomp and pri de / and set^furthe himself to be worshipped of
the^ as godd. And so being corrupted he did altogether fall from the maniers of
the grecians / through which he did sustayn great reproach among the wise /
and mutche hatred among his soldiers / and that not unworthily. Besides this
/ we must kno we / that if these men do without any Rule or godly end keape
such company / and be familiarly con uersant with the vnbeleauers / except
that in these the fruit of their conuercion do quickly appear / and of the
other also it be by all means ernestly sought / both in the reproving of their
unbelief / and in alluring them to the truithe / It does happen that there
conuercion is hindered by such company and familiarity. For whilst the
unbelievers do se that the faithful do live so friendly / and familiar ly with
them / they do judge forthewith that their supersticion / and unbelief / is not
so wicked a thing / nor yet a thing so to be abhorred and condemned / as it
is reported / yea thus may they be brought to imagine / that they may be saved
though they do persevere / and continue in their unbelief. For if it were
otherwise (shall they think) these good and godly men / would not be thus
familiar and friendly with us.

I do omit to speak of this / that many other of the brethern there ar / which
by the example of this conversation / do persuade themselves that they may do
even the self same thing / and so do bear with the wicked / and do wincke at
their evil / because that they have seen other men do so before them And thus
it commith to pas / that by the example of sum men / this evil spreadith
itself abroa de so that in the end / our faith and Religion / is eue^ laid
forth for the wicked and ungodly / to mock / and contempn.

Often times also that thing happenith / which we read to have happened in
Paul's time / amon ge the Corinthians / that the brethern by this conuersacio^ /
ar brought to be partakers of the wickednesses / 1. Cor. 10.
vile custumes / and Idolatries of the unfaithful: Which familiar conversation
/ does not only couple them with the unfaithful / but it is a mean to make
them Idolatrours: for th avoiding of which / Paul cries out in the same
place: fle Idolatry. I do likewise passover with silence / 1. Cor. 10.
that where our weak and unlearned brethern / do thus join themselves in
familiar conversation with the unfaithful / it can not be but between them and
the unfaithful / sumtyme there will happen communicacion of Religion: And the^
though it happ so that through want of learning / our weaklinges do not slyppe
and foil them selves / Yeat because they can not dissolve / and answer unto
the arguments / and subtle reasons of the adversaries aptly / there arisith
then contentius stryfes between them / and not only this / but euel speakinges /
reproaches / and hatreds / which things ar so far from edifying / that they do
altogether hinder and let it: furthermor in these conflictes it hap penith /
that our weaklinges at lenghth ar putt to silence / so that they neither speak
to confess thtruithe / nor to reprove that which is false: Now consider here
what a liberty these men do lose: which christian liberty is in free boldenes
in speakinge / to reprove that which is false / and to confess godd / and his
truithe. This liberty of free speaking and confessing / no christen man ought
so to give over / but that he in all his talk should and might use it.

But in this company of vnbeleauers / these weaklinges do not / yea darre not
use it / les they in there sayings / should be snatched up / and put to shame.
Yet truly no men / nor any company of men should cause a christian to cast
away this fredom and liberty.

For our purpose also makith that saying of (...) Cor. 6.
S. Paul. Set your selves at large / for what fellow shipp has righteousness
with unrighteousness? Or what company has light with darcknes? Or what
concord has christ with Beliall? Either what part has he that beleauith /
with an Infidel? Or how agreith the temple of godd / with Ima ges? These
words ar so plain that they need not to be expownded: In which / this
conversation of which we now do entreat / is most simplye / and plainly
forbidden. The figures and ceremonies of Moses law ar taken away / but yet
the thing figured / which is as I might say / the strenghth / the pythe / and
foundation of them / does remayn. Which thing being true / I may the^ as^e
this qu^ ^er. 15.
stion. The lord commanded that the Iues should make gardes in the quartiers
of their garments / and to put upon the guard / a ribande of yelow silcke /
^c. My question now is. Whithe lord did comma unde / that the Iues should
differ from the gentiles / not in circumcision only / but even in their garments
also? Even for this cause verily / that they should be taught even by their
gardes also / that they were gods peculiar people / and that they should
separate themselves from the gentiles / that they should not be conuersaunt with
them / neither should they join themselves in familiarity with them / farther
then the necessity of either of their lives did re quire. The Iuishe gardes we
do reject / but this which is meant by the gardes we both do and must retain.
In many places the lord commanded the Iues also that they should not return
into Egypt / and that they should not ask healpe of the Egi ptians / nor of
the Assirians: Which he did partly to this end / that through such familiarity
as then must have been between them and their healpers / the Israelites should
not be infected with their uices. The book of the Judges / does plainly
enough teach us this will and pleasure of godd. For the Israelites did sin
greunsly in this / that Iudic. 1.
they did put to tribute those Idolatrus nations / over whom the lord hadd
given theun uictorie / and did covenant with the^ / that they should dwell
among them in peace / which thing godd hadd diverse times expressly forbidden
them to do / commanding that they should utterly destroy the inhabita^tes of
that land: This he did partli by cause / that through this they should not be
brought by the Cananites / into the danger of Idolatry. Now the cause being
such with these weak / and unlearned men / of whom I now do speak / they
must likewise take good head to observe that rule / which the lord appointed
unto the Israelites. It appearith plainly / that this commandment of god was
kept long time among the Iues: For they did not use any familiarity / nor
keape company with the Samaritans which did not truly worshipe the living
godd / no not in christ's time / as it appearith by the talk that he hadd with
Joan. 4.
the woman at the well. Morouer as the good fathers in old time / did esteem
it as their singular joy / when they might be familiarly conversant with the
godly / so how mutch they sorowed When they could not be so conuersaunt with
the people of godd / and in godds house / David is witness: Who when he fledd
from the face of Saul his persequtour / did mourn / and in the psalms with
most heavy complaints / does lament / that he was compelled to be conversant
among strangers / such as did not know the living godd / and to be as it were
an exile from godd / and his people. So should the company hadd with the
unfaithful / be heavy and bitter to the faithful.

Daniell and his three felows / might have lived / Daniel 1.
upon the Kings table / and have eaten most fine and delicate meats / but
they did rather chose to ly ue together with potage / and water / and utterly
to forsake those pleasures / and delicacies / then they would defile them selves
with the meats of the vnbeleauers. Moses also / as it is writon in the epistle
to the hebrews / might if he would have been ta Hebr. (...).
ken for the Son of Pharaos daughter / and so to have been in great hoope
of obtaynynge the kingdom of Egipte: but all this set a part / he did chose
rather / forsaking all these things / to go unto his brethern / which were in
miserable bondage / seruinge and laboring in claye / and brick: Which thing to
do / as it was a great trial of his faith / so the doing of it does commend
/ and set forth his faith / and show what love he hadd to be conversant with
the poeple of godd. They which do not follow these examples / do show how
litell they do regard the glory of godd / and the commu nio^ and fellowship of
saints / which they will not gain nor redeame with loss / no though it be
of never so litill: And in this preferring of their own gain welthe and
commodity / above the glory of godd / and the felowlie communion of the
godly / they do most wickedly. Do we (says Paul to 1. Cor. 1^.
the corinthians) provoke the lord? Ar we stronger then he? These weak
brethern / which do not try their own strenghth to feel their weakness so /
that they might seek the encreace of strenghth in them selves / but being
weak indeed / both dare and do thus desperately committ themselves unto this
familiar conversation with the unfaithful / they do tempt godd / and do after
a sort provoke him / as though they would beco^me stronger then he. Many more
reasons might I bring to prove this proposicion true. That a private man /
being in a place where he is not compelled to communicate with the supersticio^s
of the unfaithful / and is unlearned unable / and to weak to confess the
truithe / must not join in familiarity / nor be familiarly dwelling and
conversant together with the unfaithful. But because I do suppose that it is
sufficiently proved by the reasons which I have alleged / I will now prepare
myself to an other proposicion.

The thread proposicion shall be / of Private men and subjects / which are learned
and strong / and of them also which are weak and unlearned / of that dwelling
which is not fre / where as men ar compel led by laws / and Tyranny to
communicate and to be partakers with the wicked in their supersticions and
Idolatries: And of these I make this proposicion / and sentence. Private men
and sub The thread proposition.
iectes be they learned or unlearned / strong or wea ke / which are dwelling
and abiding in that place where men ar compelled to communicate / and be
partakers with Idolatrors / and to be present at unlawful supersticions and
Idolatries / defiling themselves with unclean Religion / may not dwell
together nor be familiarly conuersaunt / they may not join in society with
such Idolatrors: I say / that this cohabitacion / and familiar dwelling
together is unlawful / ungodly / and not to be kept in any wise: But in this
case a faithful man must either fly / or dye for the truithe / that he be not
com pelled to defile himself with Idolatry. There is true ly but one truithe /
and that same must be holden with a pure conscience / neither must it be
forsaken for the pleasure of any man. S. Paul says to the Corin thians: fly
ye Idolatry. Then do men fly Idolatry 1. Cor. 10.
when either they do depart from the place where Idolatry is committed / or
when abiding still in the same place / they do give their lives and suffer dea
the because they will not co^mitt Idolatry nor allow it with there presence.
Paul therefore teachith by this saying / that in no wise the faithful should
come at the Idolatries of the unfaithful / but fly from them: which sentence
is so plain to the understanding of the most simple / that it neadith no
exposicion at all. The law and the prophets / the old Te stament and the
new / ar full of such sentences / and commandments / which do forbidd
strange worshippinge of godd and Idolatry. Call to your mine de the history
of the Machabees / which I do not 2. Match. 7.
^ecite as though I would give to that book any ^yke authority with the
Canonical scriptures, but by cause the history is rehearsed not only there /
but also ^n Josephus / and the examples of them ar profita^le for us / therefore
I do allege them. That godly Mother hadd rather have the whole fruit of her
^odie to be miserably destroyed / the^ ons to taste of ^wynes flesh.

Swynes flesh / and Adams apple / of their very Genesis 2.
nature are not so to be abhorred / for eiche of them is a good creature of
godd. But forsomutche as unto them godd has joined his word to forbid the
tasting of them / therefore even as Adam could not eat the forbidden apple / so
could not they eat swynes fleashe without committing of great sin: which
rather then they would do / the poor babes offer themselves to the death /
and the godly mother does most stronglye thereto encorage the^ and most
constauntly abide the same herself.

In the church of christ there have been innume rabble martirs / as Eusebius /
and others do write / which have most constantly abidden death / bicau se they
would not depart from the Religion of christ / nor file themselves with
Idolatry: They would not put one grain of franckinsence upon the altars of
the Idols / nor throw one flower / nor ons bow the knee before them / but
suffered rather dea the. They hadd this alwais before there eyes: Fear Matthew.
10. Luc. 12.
not him that killithe the body / etc. And that he spea kith of killing the
body / is likewise to be vnderston ded of taking away of goods and riches:
But he is to be feared / which after that he has taken away both life and
goods / can throw the soul into everlasting fire / fear him.

S. Paul to persuade the Corinthians that they should abstayn from meats
offered unto Idols / uses these reasons: Because they were the Temple of 7.
Cor. 8.
godd. They were the members of christ / and therefore they might not become the
me^bres of an Idol. Because they were partakers of the lords table of which
they could not be partakers and of the table of Deuels also. And the same thing
that Paul said unto the Corinthians / do I also say unto these our brethern
of whom I do entreat.

Daniel his three felows did give themselves / to Daniel. 3.
be thrown in to the burning furnace / rather then they would worshipp the
kings golden Image. But these things must now be applied unto they se our
most unhappy Days / in which / where popery rulith / the godly which do dwell
together with the ungodly / the professors of christ's gospel / I mean /
With the papists / ar compelled to be at there Masses / and most vile and
filthy Idolatries It is not lauufull to be present at the popy she Mas se and
superstitions
and supersticions: unto them does this pro posicion reatche / and of them
therefore I do plainly affirm / and say this / That it is not lawful for the^
to be present at the popish Masses / at popish superstitions and idolatries.
It is to well known / that many fondlye do flatter / and indeed de ceyue them
selves / imagining that it is lawful for them to be present at this popish
pelf. Against whom with all there clokes I use this saying of Paul / fly ye
Idolatry. But here they resist and say / that this saying and such other
as before I have alleged / are to be understood of the sacryfices done unto
Idols / and false gods / and not of such supersticions as are now grown
and used in papistrie / As of masses / and such like / for in the sacrifices of
the gentiles what so ever is done / yt is done unto Idolles / But here in the
mass that which is done is done as a worship unto god / for the name of
godd is caled on: It has the begy nynge of Christ's ordinance and
institution, although that some nowghtie men abuse it: wherefore / saying these
do thus differ from the other / (...) can not by these sentences / and like
reason be forbidden to them / as Idolatry was to the Corinthia^s: This they
say. But these me^ should considre and well understand / that theris no
owtwarde work wiche is to be esteemed as a worship and service of godd / but
only that which is appointed and ordained by godds word so to be / which ordi
naunce in the word if it want / it is utterly nothing else but man's
invention what so ever it be: for worshippings of god and gods service are
they not / but only when they have godds word to bear and warraunte them. God
can not be truly worshipped with out faith, for if faith, be not in the
worship that is done unto god / that worship the lord does abhor / as
the Prophet Esaie does witness. Ince^se is an abominable thin ge unto me / I
may not away with your new moons. rc. I hate your holy days / rc. Thus
does god reject the service appointed in his word / be cause it was done
without faith. If the service and worship of God taught in his word may
be done with out faith / and therefore displease god / mutch moore these
worshippinges which have not their ordinance in godds word ar done with out
faith / and therefore do displease godd: for faith has no place at all where
gods word is not: now these inventions of men be they never so glorious to
the eye / they be not ordained in godds word / they can not therefore be done
in fay the / they can not please god / yea god does abhor^ uuhat soever i^ not
of ^aith (...) sin ^o. 14.
them / and account them as an abomination / ^e cause they be not so done /
in faith Imeane In faith they be not done / because they are not tough^ in
godds word / for where there is no word of god there is no faith / and where
no faith is / there is no worship of godd / but a filthy hypocriste / and
stinking abomination. Now let the papists show that there mass is a
worship of god / taught in his word / which we say plainly that they can
not do / let them do it therefore if they can / and when they have done yt /
then will we say with the^: But until they have done it / their mass shall
remain a filthy and stinkinge abomination before the lord / and such a
thing as the lord does deteste and abhor. If so be that we will do honor
and worship unto men / we are accustomed principally to observe with what
thing they are most delighted / which thing after that we have per^eiued / we
do it / and then do we think to have be^towed our labor well when we have done
it: God is delighted only with that service which he ^athe set forth in his
word / wherefore he that will ^o godd acceptable service / must do that which
is word teachethe / and in such wi^e as it techethe / else as the lord by the
Prophet Esaie says / he does detest and abhor their sacrifices. And to
prove that the mass with all such popish Isay. 1.
baggadge is very Idolatry / I neade not to bring mani reasons / for this one
thing does easelie teach it. There is no true god that will be worshipped with
this popish service: for the true liuin ge god has in his word plainly
appointed the ma ner how he will be worshipped / in which word this mass / and
their popish pelfis not taught / but they are clean contrary and repugnaunte
unto it: wherefore when the wicked papists do their popish service unto a god
(they say) it is plain that they do not worship that true lyuinge godd /
who^ the holy scripture teachith us to know and worship / but sum such other
godd as they have feigned in their fantesie to be their god / such a one as is
deligh ted with these their services: But saying that in very deed there is no
such true god at all / as they do Imagine / the god then who m they serve is
but a new god / fantasied and invented in their own minds: wherefore by
right their god may and must be called / an horribe Idol / their mass
likewise with all popish service done unto him / abho minable Idolatry / And
they which do such popi / she service vile Idolatrors. But where as they say
that those things which be done and spoken in the mass had their beginning
of the ordinaun ce of Christ, and that by the wikednes of men they are
corrupted: This sainge helpethe not at all / for in these things / it is not
the begyn^ynge that is to be considered only / or that can make them good only
/ saying they are swarued from the truithe / but now their nature / and use is
to be tried / whether they do agree with the very word of god or no. what
thing hade a more pure begynynge numer. 21.
even by gods commandment, then the brazen serpent? It was erected god both
willinge and comma^dinge it. It was set forth with miracles / for whosoever
did behold it he was delivered from the bytinge of deathlie serpents / But
this not withstondinge when me^ did worship the same serpent and offered
ince^se unto it / the godly 4 Reg. 18.
did so abhor it / that Ezechias that most holy kyn ge not regardinge at all
the beginning of yt / did break it in pieces / and utterly destroyed the
worshippinge of yt / Therefore it is not sufficient to consider the beginning
of a thing / but how the order and use of yt does agree with the first
institution and ordinance. This act of Ezechias is praised in the scripture.
And would to god that we ^ade now an Ezechias which would so handle the mass.
ffurthermoore our men would have this thing to be considered in them / that
though they go to the mass / yet they have no mind to decline ^d depart
from god / but that they worshipp him ^her: unto this I answer / that the
Israelites when they did compel Aaron to make them a cal^e to worship / they
hade not indede that mind that they would fall from the true living god / so
that they would no more confess that he delivered them out of Egypt / but
this only was their mind they would not reteyne that worship of the invisible
god which was delivered them in word / but they would worship the true God
under some sign / and visible form and shape / which should represent unto
them the living God their deliverer: And that shape or form they most
desired to have / which they hade seen the Egyptians use to represente unto
them their god: They used the form or shape of an ox / the very same form
would the Israelytes now have: And as the very heathen men might have said
that they worshipped the one only true living god the Author and maker of all
things / whose majesty was showed / figured / and set forth unto them by
those diverse signs / and forms / which they did worship: As that the sign
of Minerua did set forth his wisdom: the sign of Mars his might and power:
the sign of Jupiter his Justice and goodness: So would the Israelites have
their god and deliverer set forth unto them in the shape of a Calfe / not that
they minded to turn away from him / or to deny him (as they thought) but
because they would worship him as it pleased their fantesie. But we must not
apoynte the manier and order of godds service after our mind and judgment / or
as they co^monlye say / after the good intent of men: for this doing in the
Israelites god did not like / but for yt he punyshed them grevouslye: Nether
did Moses allow it / for he knew that god would not so be worshipped. This
cloak therefore must have no place in this matier. but we must see whether god
will have such worshipe and service / whether gods word teachethe yt /
whether it be clothed with the word of truithe / which if it have not / then
do thou not worship the true god with that worship which pleasethe him.
Ieroboa^ thought mutch after this sort / for his mind was not to draw the
people away from the worship of the god Jehovah 3. Reg. 12.
but he feared les if they should customablie go to the temple at Jerusalem /
the people would fall from his kingdom and join themselves again to the house
and stock of David: wherefore he se^inge his own profit / said / that it was
not needful that they should go up unto the temple / and to the Arc of the
couenaunte when they would worship the true god: for the same god which was
represented unto the^ by the Arc of wodde and the temple / might even as well
be represented unto them by these new signs and golden calves: There is no
change but eve^ of the form and owtwarde shape: for as at Jerusalem by the
Arc / so here by the calves the living god should be represented: And what
make the yt matter what the sign be / so the worship be all oone: Therefore
the same worshipp that else they should do at Jerusalem / they might more
commodiusli do yt in bethel / and dan. So that he does nothing else / but
establishe this owtwarde work / in which he would have the^ worship the true
god: but he hade no warraunte in godds word for it / and that being ab sent /
there is nothing in his act remayninge but man's work / supersticion / and
Idolatry: so is it judged. And therefore none of his subjects should have
herckned to him. So now / when Tiraunts / Kings / Queens / Bisshopps / and
such other as ar the soudiours of Antichriste / the Pope I mean / do compel
and constrayn men unto such vile and ungodly supersticions as the popish bro
od have and do set upp, although they do pretend a good well willing mind
unto their poeple and countrith (as they say) and that all shall be for their
wealth: And though they do also say / that these things ar of an ancient
begyn^yn ge and co^tynuaunce: Yet indeed they are but popish Idolatrours / and
to Idolatry do they trayn men. Therefore their subjects must not harken unto
them neither obey them herin / But do rather as S. Paul teachith. Have no
felowshipp with their unfruitful works / but rather reprove the^. He call
Ephesians. 5.
lith them their worckes, for gods worckes they ca^ not be called / because
they do differ / and swerve from his word: with the^ (says he) have no
felowshipp What then is to be done in that case? We must (Paul says) reprove
them. And that so ost as need shall require / to reprove them with great
liberty and boldenes: So far must we be from dissemblinge with them / that we
must (he says) reprove them. If thou be a preacher / preach against them: If
thou be noone / yet speak against them / reprove them / and condemn them. But
our men do say / That it were very perillus to do thus: for then (say they)
shall we be burned / or hanged / we shall loose our goods / lands / and
promocions / I hear you well. And do you on the other part consider this as
well / that there is not one of us all which has received christendom under
such a conuenaunt and condition / that with it he should have and hold in
safety his life / his riches / and dignities without perseqution: But rather
it is said unto us / and in this case as a law laid upon us all / that
Except we do renownce Math. 16.
and utterly forsake all our things and take upp our crosses and follow christ
/ we can not be his di sciples / and except we do lose our lives we shall not
save them.

This verily / this must we determyn with our selves / this must we appoint our
selves unto / to do and abide this must we cast our acompt / To this every
christian must be so ready and bent / that he should not doubt / no not
deliberate or take advise of this matier.

That example of Cyprian is to be set before our eyes: When he was brought
unto the place where Ciprian.
he should suffer death / The magistrate being very desirus indede to deliver
him from death / said unto him. Now I do give the space to deliberate and
advise thy self well / whether thou wilt thus Wrechedly dye / or obey / and be
let go free. To who^ this godly man answered. In so holy a thing / there is no
deliberacion or advise to be taken. This readiness must every christian have in
this case to bear the cross and to follow Christ as Christ's dis^iple.
Truly they which be not this wise minded / but to save their lives and goods
do defile them selves with masses / and wicked supersticions / arr greuouslye
punished for it even present lie: first their own conscience does miserably
torment the^. Secondly the light of gods truithe which a greuus punishment.
was opened unto their mind is by little and little put out. Then the love of
the truithe and the hate of falshode waxes cold in them* fourthly their mind
becommith no more displeased or unquieted for the evil that they do / but they
begin to please them selves in this their evil and dissemblinge / yea and do
go about to persuade others unto the same. Last of all they begin to hate
the^ which do not harcken to their advise and counsel / which is to do as they
do / yea and they stir up against the^ sharp persequtio^ / for so much as
in the^ lyethe. This has been the most unhappy end of many. But this is
not the end of all their misery / as ye may well perceive / if ye do consider
what is appointed to be their perpetual portion / which shall be paid them full
truly in the last day. Let them therefore beware of this bottomless pytt which
fear to break their necks. But some there are which in this their
dissemblinge are wont to defend the^ selves after this sort: we do not these
things (say they) with our hearts / we do only thusbehaue our selves in body
/ and in outward behavior. To whom I do answer: god he is the lord of heart
and body / as he requires the worship of the heart / even as justly and
seuerlie does he command the owtwarde worship of the body: for these
owtwarde doings are a kind of confession / and therefore as men owght to be
sound and vprighte in the belief of heart / so owght they to be in owtwarde
co^fessinge and expressinge of their go dlynes and religion. The doings of men
be as it we re a tongue: The tongue does confess the thing that lies in the
heart by words: so doings do give a confession thereof indede: As he therefore
which denyethe with tongue is a denyer of Christ / so he thatin owtwarde
worckes and doings denies Christ / is justly called a deniar. Of whom
Christ does say. he that denies me before men / mat. 10.
him will I deny before my father which is in heaven: wherefore as the tongue
owghte not in the confession of godliness and religion to differ from the mind
/ so must not the owtwarde doings of the body disagree from the same. And
unto these men this also I say / with paul / that the belefe of the heart
does justify / but the mouth and owtwarde Romans 1^.
doings do make the confession unto salvation / And therefore Christ does
say / he that is ashamed mar. 8.
of me before men / of him will I also be ashamed before my father which is in
heaven. Morouer I would it were well known unto these men / that it is no true
faith which does not break forth in workinge that work which does agree
with faith. As it written of Christ / who verylie sought the glory of his
father / The zeal of thy house has eaten me / This zeal did not lie in Chri
stes breast only / but it brake forth into words / as it apeareth by his
sermons / and into deeds also / as yt apeareth there / where he with a whippe
did drive the byars and sellers out of the temple: This is a zeal / which only
deseruyth the name of a christian zeal. And even the same I say of faith.
What zeal the^ / what faith / what study or ca re for faith is it / that
these men do brag of / that they have shutt up so close in their breasts that
it breaks not forth into words and deeds? As This true christian zeal /
and their dissemblinge can not be together in oone man / even so true and
lively faith can not lurcke in such a dissemblinge breast. Furthermore / there
are two kinds of worship due unto god / an inward / and an owtwarde
worship / The inward worship is of the mind / that is when we believe
gods truithe / and do think of god true and worcester thye things / The owtwarde
worship is of the body / which is declared by those owtwarde signs that do
belong to the true worship of god / In like manner there are two kinds of
Idolatries / one is inward / which is the Idolatry of the mind / that is
when a man does not think well / nor believe truly ^nthe true living godd /
but does feign unto him self through false doctrine / either a strange god
in his own mind / or strange worshippinge of god: An other is outward which
is Idolatry of the body / and that is when we do be stowe the worship which
is only due unto god up pon creatures / And when we do owtwardlye worship god
other wise then he will be worshipped. Truly These dissemblers do not give to
god this worshipp of mind and body which is due unto him / but the Idolatry
of mind and body they do commytt / both because they owtwardlie do join with
papists in their Idolatry / and because in their mind they do persuade them
selves that it is lawful for them so to do. We think / (say they) as you
think / and in our hearts we do reteyne the truithe / and so our mind is
pure. But your bodies ye do give over to the devil and to Idols. Thy body /
says Paul / is a membre of Christ / why do thou make yt the membre of an
harlot? 1. Cor. 6.
here they will say against me / that Paul spoke this of whordome / I
grant that: But the prophettes do teach us that the most vile and horri ble
whordome is Idolatry. Hieremie / Ezechiel / and the other prophettes do speak
so against the Iues and their Church / that they name it to be even like an
harlot which has opened her legs vn^ everye tree that hade any bowghes to
Idols and ungodly Idolatries. Wherefore if thou may not make thy body the
membre of an harlot, thou mu ste not make yt the membre of an Idol. This
collation betuene whordome and Idolatry is plain and true / taught by the
prophettes and Paul. Morouer how vain this there excuse is / that saying
does sufficyentlie declare / in which the lord pronounces. I have left me
seven thousand in Israel / of which never man bowed his knees unto 3. Reg. 19.
baal / nor kissed him with his mouth. He says not / which think well in
their mind / which do believe well / but he shows the sign of owtwarde
worshippinge / that is to bow the knee / and kiss. which does teach that
there is required unto the true worshipp of godd / not a pure mind only / but
the owtwarde sign / toke^ / and doing of worship / and service. The lord
our god is not content with halfes / he will not part stakes with the dyuel.
All knees (says the lord) shall bow unto me. God will not part so / that he
shall have the mind / and Esaias. 45.
the dyuell the body. All is mine / says the lord / and I will have all or
none / I will have both the obedience of the heart and the bowinge of the
knee: Which worship by these thy dissemblinges thou take from god / and so
thou do rob him of his honor / and bestow it upon Idolles / even po pishe
masses. But thou saiste / I despise the Mass / and all Idolatrous popery in
my heart: why then do thou prostitute thy body unto yt? My mind is pure
thou say: ye / but god will have mind and body pure. If this thy reason
and excuse were of any force / then might the Corinthia^s have said to Paul
/ why do thou so reprove us? we also by the grace of god do know that there
is no Idol. A true opinion we keep in our mind of godd his truithe / let god
be content with that / and in the mean time our bodies shall serve for our
co^mo dyties. But paul tells them plainlye that they do 1. Cor. 10.
communicate with devils. The meats offered to Idols of their own nature
were pure / yet when the corinthians do eat them with the Idolatrors in there
Idolatry / then they become (says paul) partakers of the table of deuilles:
when ye then be present at a Mass / which is an Impure thing / and do there as
the papists do / mutch more justly is it said of you / that then ye ar
partakers of those deulishe dragges which are in the Mass. Again our men do
obiecte and say: It is not we that have corrupted these things / we would be
glad to have them pure and incorrupte: there impuritie must not be adscribed
unto us. I answer: An other man's sin shall not indeed be imputed unto the /
for each man shall bear his own sin: but yet this thing I do reprove in
the / that thou do communicate with wickedness: This is thy sin / here thou
art defiled. and for this shall thou be judged. Paul said unto the
corinthians: Are not they 1. Cor. 1^.
which do eat of the sacrifice / partakers of the temple? what say I then?
that the Image is any thing? or that it which is offered to Images is any
thing? ^aie. but this I say / that the things which the gentills do offer /
they offer to deuels and not to god. I would not that ye should have
fellowshippe with the devils: ye can not drink of the cup of the lord /
and of the cup of Deuels / ye can not be partakers of the table of the lord
and of the table of deuels. Though corrupcion of meats offered unto Idols is
not to be imputed to all them that be partakres of them / (which were not
indeed corrupt of the^ selves (as I said) but when they were offered unto
Idols that made them corrupt) yeat the veraye communicating and eating of them
with Idolatrors is a fault justly laid to their charge / from which they should
have keapte themselves as well for the honor that they do owe unto godd / as for
the conscience which they ought to have to edyfie other men. If it were not so /
whi did paul thus rebuke the Corinthians? Yea whi would not our holy martirs
of the primitive church communicate and be partakers in the Sacri fices of the
heathen? The martirs might have said / we know that an Idol is nothing / and
to offer up sense to them is but an owtward thing / we do it but in body / our
spret and heart is pure / and tha^ we do / against our will we do it etc. They
verily did know no such excuse / but they considered that godd required this /
that they should outwardly confess him / and reprove / and fle from Idolatry:
And therefore as well for their duties sake toward godd / as because they would
not offend the brethern by their example / they did give their life in the
quarel^ without making any such blind excuses.

These men do say further that the Mass is not to be lickened justly unto the
Idolatry of the heathen / for that was directly forbidden of godd / so is not
the Mass / say they: for though it has sumwhat swarued aside / yeat is it
the Institucio^ of christ. But to the contrary I do say / that the Mass is
so far swarued from the ordinance of christ / that it has nothing agreing
with christis Institucion / yea and that it is most directly repugnant unto it
/ A very Idol / wherein massemu^gers do commit very vile Idolatry. And this
will I prove by diverse reasons. ffurst of all. The Supper of the Lord / as it
was delivered of christ should be a public and a common work and action:
for Christ our Savior made it with his Apostles. But now in the Mass / there
commithe forth one sacrificing priest / disguised with strange array / and he
does all things alone / the rest stand still loking / heeringe / and holding
their peace. If paul did worthily and Justly say / when the Corinthians did
not tarry and look one for an other / that they did not then eat the Lords
supper / then there is not the Lords supper eaten / where one tarieth not for an
other so that they may eat all together: And how shall we then say / that
the Mass is the Lords supper / where one only sacryficing pressed does eat and
drink up all alone? surly it can not be so called: for to be, and not to be
the Lords supper / ar contrary / Paul says / it is not the Lords supper /
wherefore call your Mass by what name ye will / the Lords supper it is not / for
paul is to be beleaued be fore all massinge merchants.

They say morouer that in their Mass / they do offer up the son of godd
unto the eternal father for the sins of the quick and the dead: And this
they do call the principal point of their mass. But in the Last Supper of
the Lord that Sacrifice and oblacio^ was not made / but upon the cross / as
the scripture witnessith. And as for this their offer^ge / ffurst / paul does
deny it in most plain words in the epistle to the hebrews / where he says
that all Heb. 9. 10.
oblacions for sin were consummate and finished / and all things made perfect
by that one only oblacion / which christ Jesus our Savior in his own parson
made of himself upon the cross. The word of godd teachithe / that christ
was but ons only to be sacrificed and offered / And that Sacrifice no more to
be made: for if it were often to be made / then the furst was not perfect / But
the furst was perfect / Therefore there must be no repeating of it. The papists
do say / that they daily offer christ for to take away sin / and that this
Sacrifice must be daily repeted of them /

The scripture denies this plainly: And thus ye do se that here is a plain
contradiction.

Again The supper of the Lord was not instituted to the end that such a
sacrifice for sin (as they feign) should be made of it / but that in the use
of it the communicantes should be put in mind / and made partakers of that only
propiciatorie sacrifice which christ offered ons only for all ever upon the
cross. And therefore there Mass / in which they would work such marueyles / and
the Lords supper ar utterly unlike. But here they will reply and say.

The fathers do speak thus of this Sacrifice / We grant indeed / that the
fathers do often times speak so as though that the lord were offered in this
administracion of the Sacrament / or sacrificed: But they used this word /
Sacrifice, improperly / for by that kind of speaking they did understand /
the offringes of praise / and sacrifices of thanckes made and given for
christ's sacrifice done upon the cross / This they called to sacrifice. Our
sacrificing prests are not content with this / for they will have their own
work to be an unwonted work / belonging to them alone / which neither the
scriptures / nor the fathers do teach: ffor to offer this Sacrifice of which
the fathers do speak / partayneth not to the priest alone / but to the whole
poeple that sto^dith by / and does communicate / And so it is a common oblacion
and sacrifice of all / not of the preiste more then of the poeple / but this
only that the priest both in words and action / does go be fore thepoeple.

Augustine does say / that the church is offered in that offeringe which it
does offer. ffor all which do de Ciuitate dei. lib. 10. cap. 6.
communicate / they do offer them selves unto godd / and do testify that their
will is / to abide in christ.

The papists do hold also that the bread is turned into the substance of
christ's body / and that there remaynith nothing but the quality and accide^
ce of bread as whitenes / rc. for the substance / say they / is christ's
body. But the scripture says that christ in his last supper did give bread
unto his disciples / and paul callith it bread also / yeat in the Mass the
papists say that it is otherwise. 1. Cor. 11.


The use of the bread and wine by christis institucio^ is only / that the
congregation should eat and drin cke thereof in the remembrance of christ / But
the pa pistes in their Mass do most shamefully abuse them both. ffor wheare as
the word of godd says: Thou shall worshipp the Lord thy godd Deutron 6
math. 4.
and him only shall thou serve / They in there mass do lift upp the bread and
wine / and even in the rowme of godd they set them furthe to be adored and
worshipped of the poeple: now how far this differrith from the use of christ's
supper eich man may se. Yea what can be more vile and filthy Idola try / then
to adore and worshipp a peace of bread and cupp of wine / as godd? Be not
offended that I do use these bare names. I do confess / that whosoever acording
to the Lords Institucio^ does co^munica te with the co^gregacio^ and does
eat the bread and drink of the cupp of the Lord / beholding the death of
christ with Lively faith / the same man is in spre te and after his manier /
made partaker of the body and bludd of the lord. Contrari wise if thou do not
use the bread and wine acordinge to the ordinance of christ / but gase upon
them / then ar they nothin ge else to the / but bread and wine: But if in a
popish Mass / or in the popish ha^ging / heauing / carrying / or handelinge
of them / thou do worshipp them / the^ ar they unto the a false Idol / and
thou indeed a filthy Idolatror. If therefore thou wilt be partaker of the body
and bludd of christ in the holy supper / then eat the bread and drink the
cupp as the lord has instituted. Godd would have the poeple in the use of the
holy Supper to ascend vppwarde into heaven in mind and affection / that they
might there cleave fast unto christ. And therefore the true ministers of the
church do labor to ^he uttermost of their pour / thus to lift up the
poeples mind into heaven / that they should not seek christ in the world /
^at they should not thinck any fleshly or ear thely thing of him: These men
clean contrary in the order of their Sacrament and Mass do miserably detayn
the poeple in the earth / bynding and hol ding them to the visible signs.

The apostle commaundith that things should not 1. Cor. 14
not be done in the congregation in a strange tongue / except there were an
Interpretour / that the thing being vnderstonded of all / the hearers might
say / Amen / and that the edifyinge of them should be sought. Now these men in
their mass do all in the Laten tongue / which is to the common poeple unknown
/ and they do defend this their doing even against the word of godd. But it is
most certain that christ our savior in his administration / and after him all
his apostles and disciples which were hebrews / used their vulgar hebrew tongue
/ the Grecians also their greek tongue. And even unto this day the Sclauonians
in their churches use their vulgar and commen speech.

Those words of our great and singular consolation / in which the partakinge
of Christ's body and blood is promised / the papists in their Mass speak
secretly / they whisper them so that even they which know the Latin tongue
ca^ neither hear the^ nor understand them. And so do they rumble them up to
their own selves as though the people were unworthy to hear the^: But
christ in his super spoke the^ openly. And so the greek church and the Chur
che of India / do yet speak the^ with a^ audible voice And the ancient manier
was / as Ambrose and Augustie among other of the fathers do testify that the
people did answer unto those words. Ame^. But as I suppose the papists do thus
murmr and speak these words in secret / because they would not ha ue their
Lies known / for they do say / Take ye and eat / and this so often as ye do
/ do yt in the reme^brau^ ce of me. But who takes / or to who^ do they give?
The words be spoken to the people: And yet they the^ selves do eat and drink
up all alone / and do distribute unto no man else. Is not this to make a lie?
To lie always is taken to be an evil thing / but before god to lie / is a
most shamles and wiked thing: who does eat (o ye lyyng papists) or who
does drink with you? If ye do distribute at any time to any other ye do yt not
when ye your selves receive / but ye chose for them an other time / yea and
another kind also / for to the^ ye do minister but the bread only. Thus ye
se that all these things which these massers do in their mass / ar contrary
to the institution of Christ. There mass then and Christ's supper are not like

The papists say that by their Action (I mean there handeling of there bread
and wine) they do ap plie unto others the profitt of Christ's bloody sacrifice
and passion. Of a Sacrament they say that they make sacrifices to profit the
quick and the Dead, and this do they i^ there mass: But the scripture
teaches / that there is but one only propiciatorie sacrifice / able and
auaylable to take away sins / which Christ Jesus offered in his own
flesh upon the Cross. And that every man must apply unto him self by
lively faith the benefit of that same sacrifice of christ / as the
scripture teaches likewise / that each man is justified by his own faith,
and that each man in his own righteousness or vnrigh teousnes / does live / or
die. It teachithe also that christ did institute the sacrament only to this
end that the congregation should eat and drink it in the reme^beraunce of
that same his Sacrifice. And that eicheone in the drincking thereof should apply
un to himself by faith / the fruit of that Sacrifice. Now compare the
doctrine of the scriptures and of the papists in this point together / and
thou shall se that their Mass is contrary to christ's In stitucion. But as
they have / so still will they say:

That as well the living as the dead be helped by this their act applied at
their pleasure. If they would say that they profyt others by prayer / that
were tolerable. But they go further and say / that there very massinge work
it self / has so much virtue / power and strenghthe in it / that it shall
profit not only all kinds of me^ / but all such creatures and beasts for whom
they do say there mass / because in it they do apply the benefit of christ's
passion: but ye must understood when they be paid for there labor. This is an
horrible error in no wise to be suffered / for as I said / there is but one
only sacrifice propicia torie to take away sin / which one sacrifice eiche
one of us must apply unto our selves by lively faith / And this applyinge
faith is the only gift of god: But on this ground build they their
purgatory and mutch other such pelf / by which they do pyckemens purses. They
say there Masses also in the honor of this / or of that saint. And of what
saints? such verylie whose histories are not certaynlie known / and are of
none authority / yea many of the^ are no better then poets fables / of who^
not unworthily we doubt whether they be saints or no: But be it that they
were true saints / yet this their doing is most contrary to christ's
ordinance / for Christ did institute his supper to this end that it should be
used in the remembrance of his death and not of other men's / wear they never
so holy.

In their mass they have also diverse and sundry rytes and customs / clothes /
signs / gestures / tor nes / remouinges / and blissinges / of and with the bre
ade and wine / but christ used none of all these in his supper: And what they
do mean by these things the poeple does not know / neither can the priests
them selves for the most part tell what is meant by them: for if ye ask the
meaning of them / either ca^ they say nothing at all / or if they do say
owghte / they do not say all one thing / but things that be most contrary
/ whereby a man may judge that there is no truithe at all in their words. But
here they do say. Think thou that the foolish unlearned peo ple in the
old Law did understand all the legal ceremonies? no it was not requisite /
no more is yt now: To this I answer / Although that all the poeple did not
know what was mente by them in the old law / It sufficed yet that they hade
the worcester de of god for them / Now do ye show unto us the word of god for
these your signs and it shall suffice us.

Again the godly and learned preistes could show what was meant by the rites and
ceremonies o^ the law / and that by the word of godd: but y^ can do neither of
these: for ye have enuented these toys in your own brains: signs ye do call
them but ye do not know what things they do signify. And therefore as in rites
your Mass does differ from christ's supper / so when ye say your pleasure o^
your rites / ye are not to be beleaued: for faith has no place where gods
word does not show it self Isaide that massemungers in their mass do committ
Idolatry. Their bready god hanged up i^ a pix / and their Images / unto which
they turn^ them selves and do make their most unclean service and sacrifice
do prove this true: Neither do they account it sufficient to behold these
their Idol when they say their Masses / but also they do offer unto them /
they cense them / they bow the kne^ unto them: let them now deny whilst
they will that they do not worship the bread / nor the Images / yet this
worship they do them / This kind o^ worship (Isaye) which is given
customabilie vnt^ god alone / as the law of god teaches. But seing^ they give
this unto these Idols / are they not. Ido^ latrors? yes truly. And how the^
dare any christian be present there / to uncover the head to bow the kne to
offer and do such like things with them?

They say that there Mass is christ's Institution / And our men (of whom I now
have spoken) do say that the Mass has sum affinity with christ's
institucion of the holy supper.

But I say that the old heathens might with more color of truithe / excuse
and defend their sacrifices by that manner / then these men may do their
mass. For verylye the sacrifices of the heathen have less departed from the
manner which the fathers used in sacrificinge before the law given / which also
the lord approved in the law / the^ these massers do from the supper which
Christ / and the Apostle paul has prescribed. In both their sacrifices was
the invocation of god / a Temple / an Altar / slain sacrifices / sacrificinge
priests / sleynge of beasts / sheddinge of blood / salt / wine / oil /
mele / an holy feast / holy garments / washinge / censinge / fire / singinge
/ prophecies / and such other things / all which to repeat it were to long:
let our Massers (if they can) show so many things in their mass agreinge
with the things which Christ did in the holy supper: Which thing if they
can not do / then let them cease to boaste that their Mass is the institution
of Christ and the Apo stles / from which it differethe so far that if the
Apostles and fathers of the primatyue church were now here to behold this
mass / they should not know it to be the lords supper / but would surly
marueyle at such a monstruo us mahometrie.

Iomytte also that in and with their Mass they ha ue many Anniuersaries
yearemyndes / diriges done for the dead: But The Lord did not institute any of
them. If they say that Cyprian and others of the fathers do speak of such
Annyuersaries: I answer that those of which the fathers do make mencyon / were
nothing else but tha^ckfull reme^brau^ces of the Martirs departed / in which
they did give thancks to godd for the^. They also in their Masses do call up
pon the saints and holy men departed / which is a thing most contrary to true
godlynes / and utterly unknown and unpracticed in the administracion of the
Lords supper.

And to be short all their things which they do in their Masses / they do
choppe and change / they bye and sell and set them furthe to most vile and
filthy gain. Wherefore / my most Loving Brethern take ye diligent heed / les
whilst ye pretend to worshipp godd in your going to Masses / and to entreat
him to be merciful unto you / yedo not most migh tyly kindle his wrath
against you by hearing of these Masses: which as ye plainly do se / ar
nothing else but a shamfull devise set upp to deface the death of christ / a
pestilent practice fownde out to overthrow the true use of the Lords supper /
and an Idolatry invented to infect the poeple and to make them Idolatrors.
whearby eich man may easily indge / how great a sin it is / to be partaker of
a Mass.

But notwithstondinge all this which is spoken / yeat these men which think
that they may dissemble at the Mass / cease not to say / That though the
Mass be not the Lords supper / but an Ido latrie / yet is not the presence at
it so earnestly to before bidden / seeing that such things have been gran^ted
unto the Infirmities of me^: If a man do ask them wheare: They do bring forth
the Example of Naaman Naman.
the Syrian / and by it they will neades have it made Lawful unto them to
communicate with wi cked supersticio^s. for he prayed ^eliseus / say they / 4.
Reg. 5.
that he might be suffered to kneel in the temple of Rymmon that Idol / when
the king did worshipp / and lean upon his arm. whom the prophet answered /
goo in peace. And that / say they / which was permitted unto Naaman / whi do
ye forbid unto us? Furst these men should weye with them selves / whether that
we only have read this Example of Naaman / or not. ^o we think that the holy
Apostles and Martirs of the old church which were occupied night and day in
the holy scriptures / did not consider this act and Example? Truly they were
not ignorant of the history / yet did they never know this understanding of
it: for if they did / whi then would they not follow this example / especially
when they might thereby have saved their lives?

But these holy and godly learned men did see that thing in this history /
which our men do not consider / namely this / that Naama^ now newly converted
to the faith was a smoking flax which was not to be putt out / a weak and
shaken read which was not to be brosed in pieces / and that as yet he was very
weak / for he was not yet prepared and ready to deny and forsake himself and
all that was his for gods sake. He thought that it might come to pas that he
should together with the knowledge of the Living godd / easili hold and keape
still his old place / office / and dignity / if he could happen to have that
/ which he desired of the prophet: And when he did well perceive that this was
his infirmity and sin / it trobled himso that therefore he desired the prayers
and help of Heliseus: he desired him / that if he should happen to fall into
this evil / yeat that he might be favored / that he might find mercy / and
that Heliseus would pray that the Lord would forgive him. Who does at any time
ask forgyuenes for that which he acco^ptithe Lawful? forgyuenes is asked for
sins only / Naaman therefore acknowledged this his act to be a sins And if I
so fall (quod he) then pray the Lord to forgive me. This place therefore does
make most against our men / and even the same ways which they go about to
excuse their fact / by the same it is most plainly proved to be sin. Let
them aknowledge therefore in their doi^ge that thing / which Naaman the Sirian
did. And let them beg the mercy of godd / and the prayers of godly men / that
the same thing which they have evil done / and do / may be pardoned them.
Neither did Eliseus / as our men do think / grant Naaman license or
liberty to do so as he hadd said / but only he said unto him / goo in peace:
which manier of speaking was a kind of taking leave used in that age. And as
for any other thing there can none be gathered out of those words / onles it be
this that he promised to do that which Naaman required: goo thy wa yes (says
he) I will do as thou desire / I shall pray for the. The prophet does not
reject him / if he should fall into this evil. As we do not utterly reject nor
shutt these me^ from grace which thus do fall: Ye^t must we sharply reprove
their doings that they may acknowledge their fault and sin / and vnfay ^edly
lament and repent the same. And we ought also heartily to pray that they may be
raised up again. They do object also certain words out of the Epistle of
Jeremy / which is e^titled Baruch. The worcester des ar these. Now shall ye see in
Babylon godds of Bar. 6.
gold / of silver / of wodde / and of stone / borne upon men's shulders to
cast out a fearefulnes before the heathen / But look that ye do not as the
other: be not afraid let not the fear of the^ overcome you. There for when ye
do ^ee the multitude of poeple worshipping them behind and before / say ye
in your har^es / O Lord / it is thou that ought only to be worshipped / Of
these words our men do gather / that it is sufficient for them when they are
present at Idolatries / Masses / and popish supersticions / to say in there
heart / O Lord it is thou that ought only to be worshipped. In answer to
these men: furst I say / that this book entitled Baruch is none of the
Canonical scriptures: And therefore no man is bownd to the doctrine of it. But
admit the book were of sufficient authority / Then these men must
understand / that the prophet does not give the Iues leave to comme unto the
temples of Idols / that there they might be present at ungodly Idolatry / bow
there knee / and so make up the matier / with saying in their heart to the true
and living godd / O Lord / it is thou that ought only to be worshipped. But
he gyuith the Iues instruction against Images which were carried about / and Ido
latries which were used in those places where they were exiles: ffor the Maneir
of the Babilonians was / not only to have Images in there temples / but also to
have them set abroode and carried openly upon men's shulders. As it is not
unlike that the Image of Nabugodonosor, which being dedicated in the feilde of
dura, was carried about the who le Regio^ with Musical Instruments and so^ges
/ at the sownde of which whersoeuer the Image was seen / commandment was
given unto all me^ that they should worshipp it: which Daniels felows wol de not
do. Of these things I say / that epistle entreatithe / plainly to warn the
godly / that they should not adore / nor worshipp those Idols though that the
heathenishe poeple did so both before them / and behind them / but when they
did see this Idolatry / detesting it / they should then say / O lord / it is
thou to whom worshipp does only belo^ge: he said not / bow the knee with
the^ / and say in your hearts / o lord / it is thou rc. but when ye do see
these Idols and Idolatrye / say so. These seyngs and suddayn meetings in the
city streets and fields / could not be avoided / and therefore the godly were
to be enstructed and admonished / how they should behave them selves in that
case.

But our men / as they are veraye bold to abuse the scripture for their
purpose / go on further and ask / how it happened that Daniel was not thrown
into the fiery furnace with his fellows? seeing like Daniel. 3.
punishment was appointed unto all men which did not worship. They will of
necessity have it granted them therefore / that Daniel did dissemble / (as they
now do) and that therefore nothing was done unto him: And that thing which
Daniel did / they think that they may do. I answer our men thus / that they
do not reason well to say / He was not punished / therefore he was there and
worshipped / they do put more in the conseque^t / then is in the antecede^t /
and so to reason is to make a subtle cauillacion / taking that to be a cause
which is no cause. For there might be many other causes / wherefore Daniel was
not likewise punished: happily the Image and he did not meet together: or if
he did meet it / men did not mark what he did: or else though men marc^ed that
he did not worshipp / yet he was not accused: or if he were accused / yet
through the singula^ favor which the King did bear unto him he was delivered
from punishment. It must not then forth with follow / that Daniel for fear of
death did present himself before that Idol / and did dissemble his Religion /
doing there as other Idolatrors did: this we must not judge of Daniel / seeing
in the life quarrel / he was not afraid to be thrown unto the lyo^s. Daniel. 6.
Now seeing there may be many other causes why he was not cast into the fire
with his fellows / why do these men chose unto them selves this one cause? and
that such a one / as is sclau^derous unto that ho ly man / of which in the holy
scriptures / there is not so much as a suspicion contained. Yet they do think
that they do not unaptly say for themselves / and defend their cause / when
they do allege that out of the Acts of the Apostles: where mention is made
Actor. 21.
how that Paul / through the council of the Elders of the church of
Jerusalem / did take on him a vow with other four men / and did purifye him
self after the manner and custumme of the Iues. If (say they) such an Apostle
did take this lybertye to use in Jury the ceremonies which were now abrogated
/ eue^ we also may use / and comme unto the rites / and ceremonies now used in
our countrithe. For the better vndersto^ding of this matter we must first well
consider what the sum of Paul's preachinge was: We do suppose (faith he) that
a man is Romans 3.
justified by faith / without the works of the Law. And as many as are under
the deeds of the Law Gal. 3.
are subject to the curs. Again the Just man shall Abac. 2. Romans 1.
live by his faith. This is the sum of Paul's doctrine / whereby it does
appear / that Paul did not utterly condemn the observing of the ceremonies
of the Law / but only when it was done with this mind / as though that
Justification did come thereby. And the same his meaning he vtterith most
plainly to the Galathians / where he says. As many of Gal. 5.
ye as are circumcised / ye are fallen from the grace of Christ: for Christ
shall not profit you at all: ye are gone quite from Christ / as many as are
Justified by the Law / As if he would say / These things of their own nature
do not alienate and separate us from Christ / but only when they be done with
this mind and purpose / to be Justified by them: Take away this opinion / and
this evil hurtefull purpose being removed / then Paul commends these
worckes / and all other ciuyle ordinances commanded / and appointed to that
Nation: he conde^neth them not / but so far as they were justly and not
supersticiously used / he did leave the^ in their place / and did not hinder
the obseruacion of them. As he did Gal. 3.
^lso write / that in the Lord / there was neither Iue ^or gentill / neither
bond nor fre. And that in Chri^e Gal. 6.
Jesus / neither circumcision avails any thing ^t all / nor uncircumcision /
but the observing of the ^ommau^dementes of God / or a new creature. And 1.
Cor. 7.
^gaine if any be called being circumcised / let him not ^dde uncircumcision.
If any be called uncircumcised / ^et him not be circumcised. Let every man
abide in the same estate / in which he is called. All these indifferent things
/ might sometime be well observed / sometime be as well left undone / as most
served for edifying in godd. Of which use and obseruacion of the^ Paul does
speak / when of him self he says: I am 1. Cor. 9.
made all unto all me^ / that I might win many: Unto the Iues / I am made as
a Iue / to the^ which are without the law / as though I were without a law.
This sentence he has also confirmed by exam ples: For when he was required to
circu^cise Timothy Actor. 16.
because that the custumme which was yet in force might be kept / he did it:
But when they would enforce him to the ouerthrowig of the christian liberty /
that he should likewise circumcise Titus / In no Gal. 2.
wise would he give place unto them / no not for the space of one hour / and
that because (says he) false brethren came in / to epsy out / or to betray
our liberty. S. Paul did observe these things then / when it might be done
without an evil mind / when no hurt should ensue of it: The cause and end why
Paul did it / was to avoid the offendinge of the beleauing Iues / les if he
did it not / they should thereby be alienated and turned away from Christ's
gospel / which they had newly received. But we must not compare these
ceremonies of the old law with the Inuencions of men / they can not be justly
compared with Massing: They were plainly taught in Gods word / but these
masses and popish Idolatries are thrust unto us by the subtlety of the deuell
/ and craftye deceyuing of me^. They were thinindiffere^t / and as such things
might be well used. But these are things utterly evil and can not be well
used. They after Christ's ascenscion into heaven were not forbidden / and
therefore might be observed / so long as the Temple and commonwealth of Israel
did continue and the city was undestroyed / and until the full reuelinge and
preachinge of the gospel was had / until by it the church of Christ / which
was to be gathered of the Iues and gentiles / were well / and fully united and
knitt together. Neither were those ceremonies / as Augustine faith / suddenly
Aug. Epistol. 19. ad Hieron.
and without honor to be buried and thrown away. But these masses / and such
popish supersticions / which are farsed full with Idolatry / always have
been / are / and shall be forbidden. Those things might therefore be feapt and
observed for a time / so that men did not use them with that mind (as I said)
to be justified by them. Wherefore if thou wilt consider the matier it self /
that is / the nature of the act / Paul can neither be therein reprehended /
nor yet can these dissemblinge Massehaunters use his well doing as a defense
for their evil doing: but much les can this be done / if thou will search
out the mind / council / and intent of Paul's doing. Both these things
these mayntayners of massehaunting do want. For furst they are occupied in a
thing which is contrary / and repugnant to Godds word / as it is already
declared. Secondly / in this their dissimulacion they do only seek themselves /
for ^o thend that they may retain their riches / dignity / and estimacion by
falling to poperye they offend the weak and draw them by their example from
Christ to Antichrist / whereas Paul did herin obser ue things commanded in
Gods word / and the^ to this end only / les the beleauing Iues should fall
back from Christ / and that he might the more easily draw others / which yet
beleaued not / to the gospel of Christ. Furthermore these men do say / that
they by their dissimulacion will avoid offense. For (say they) if we should so
utterly forsake the Mass as ye would have us / we should be taken as wicked
me^ and evil doers / and so shall we give great offense in our countrithes. I
grant that these men do seek to avoid offense / but what offense? eue^ the
offense of the world. They will not offend / but whom? Tyrau^tes / and such as
ar the very limbs of antichrist. And why? les they should procure against
themselves their wrath / pour / and tyra^nie. But this is that offense / which
Christ says should not be avoided: Let them alone (says he of the Phariseis)
They are blind and Mat. 15.
the leaders of the blind. Here we must consider which be evil offenses /
and such as are to be avoided indeed. Eue^ those I say / which are an
Impediment to the setting forth of the gospel / which do offend and hinder me^
/ be they simple / or wicked / that they do not embrace pure doctrine / and
turn unto Christ. Now behold / I pray the / by coming to the Mass / what
offense thou do give? The Idolatrous and supersticious people / ar they not
offended by this thy doing? Yeas verily. For when they do se the hau^te their
masses / they say / these gospellers do come to our masses / which they would
not do if our masses were so evil as they call the^: wherefore we may persevere
and continue in our old purpose. And on the other part / the weaker brethren /
which are but newly turned / and not far entered into the knowledge of Christ
/ when they do se these better learned professors / enseyng bearers / and chief
men in the scole of Christ comme to the mass / they are taught to do the like:
and where before they were persuaded not to comme at masses / now they think
that they were then deceived / and that it is but a fond precise scrupulositie
so to abstayn from masses: and it comes to pas / that where they should go
forward in the way of truth / now they do go back. Thus both the wicked and
the godly / are offended by thy example: It is plain therefore that under the
cloked color of avoiding of offense / these men do fall into the very offense
gyuing. They say morouer: It is needful to co^discende unto the weak: for
there are many which are not persuaded that the mass is naught / and therefore
are neither ready to forsake their country / nor to dye in the quarrel /
which men if they should perceive that we did not come to mass / they would
not give then any ear or credit unto us in the other matiers and chief points
of religion: wherefore we must give and yealde somewhat unto their infirmity /
as Paul does teach the Romans. This they say. But what will Paul / I pray
you / that we Romans 14.
should yealde to the weak? This verily / first that we should not please our
selves: Again / that we should not so live after our own mind / that we should
contemn their salvation. We do grant therefore that some thing is to be given
unto the infirmity of the weak brother / but even with Paul / we will not
suffer that to be done / but in things indifferent. But those things which of
them selves ar evil and forbidden of Godd / must not be done in respect of any
man. For that same Rule does stand certain which Romans 3.
gives leave to no man to do evil that good may comme thereon. To abstayn /
or not to abstayn from meats / was then a thing indifferent. In such things
they which be stronger must bear with the Infirmity of the weaker: but meat
eating and Massehauntinge are not like / for this is no thing indifferent / but
manifestly evil / as it is sufficiently proved / and therefore it is not to be
done in respect of bearing with any man that is weak. But are the weak
always to be borne with all in things indifferent? no truly / we must not
always yealde to the weak but only whylest they be taught: And when they do
understand the thing that is taught them / and yet do waver and doubt of a
wilful scrupulositie / their infirmity is no longer to be norished nor born
with all: For we must not so bear with them / that our liberty shall be in
subjection to their frowardnes / nor that thereby we do hurt others by our
example.

Again they object and say: If we should do as ye would have us to do / then
must we either fly out of our cou^trithe / or else forthwith shall we suffer
death and so the congregatio^s shall be left utterly desolate / there shall be
none left to teach and norishe those af flicted me^bres which shall remain
in our church: Better it is / that by our bearing and dissemblinge / there do
remain yet sum leight / then that by doing as ye would have us all together
should be putt out. If su^ do remain there / it will brust forth at le^gthe / 1.
Cor. ^5.
and a litill leaue^ will sour the whole lu^pe of dowe^c Truly for all this
goodly clooke / it is easily perceived that through this disse^bling the
edifying of the church is hindered and not furthered. These men prete^de with
Athlas to bear up heaven with their shulders / but they do overthrow
altogether: Godd does se more the^ we / in the things which shall hap pen to
the church: We must obey him in seruyng him and his church with the
confession of truth. The issue / and succes / let us co^mitt unto him to whom
the church does belong: And let us do that whereunto we are called. The church
shall be destroyed the^ / thou say: Let God care for that / he will well
provide for that / let us not doubt. Well may these me^ be answered / as the
lord answered Peter / when he called him / saying: follow me: Peter made a
stay at it and asked him what John should do. If Joan. 21.
I will (says Christ) have him to tarry / what is that to the? do thou follow
me. So if thou ask in this case / what shall then be done with the church? I
answer / what is that to the? Do thou the thing where unto thou art called.
Besides this often times the doctrine of the gospel is more set forth / and
better received / when it is mayntayned by death / and fleinge / then when by
words only it is propownded and taught: for then men are taught by deeds / as
before they were by words: Haste thou confessed the gospel in words? This
then remains for the to do: die / or fly for the gospel so shall thou
confess the same indede. And Let us not fear the desolatio^ of the church /
for where one of our brethern dies / or flies fo: the doctrine / in his rowm
shall rise up a great sort. But if we stand and continue in dissemblinge /
the^ is the light of the truithe put out / nether is there any confession made
indede.

They bring in also the examples of Zachary / John the Baptist / the virgin
Marie / and Joseph / which in the corupted and infected times when they lived
did come unto the service of God in the Temple of the Iues / The samething
may be permitted to the^ (they think) and that yt is as lawful for the^ to
partake and use the ceremonies in the popish church be they never so corrupt.
True it is that there were many wicked doctrines and evil opinions at that time
emo^gest the scribes and pharisees. But yet the estate of the^ was far
otherwise / the^ it is in our time: They hade corrupted the docrrine of the law
and of justification. They were covetous / That thing which they did / Was done
with out faith / and therefore abominable before God / yet the rite and manner of
sacrificing appointed by Gods law was not changed / for the same beasts
were offered which the law did command / the same days were observed / and
ceremonies / and therefore it was lawful to use the^ inasmoche as they hade the
word of Godd for the^. And eiche man that so used the^ received according to
the measure of his faith. For the corrupt doctrines / sentences and manieres
of the priests / Bishops and scribes / did not hurt at all the prophettes
and godly men which were the^ selves clear from the^ / of a contrary mind to
the^ / in all things thinking according to Godds word / yea did also reprove
and sharply rebuke those things: which thing Augustine does witness as he
is allegded. 23. q. 4. ca. Recedite. and in many other places there. Let our sa
crificinge priests do the same unto us at this day. Let the^ celebrate the
lords supper and use other ceremonies / so as by Godds word they be appointed
/ the^ we will not draw back at all / but use the^ / though they the^ selves
think corruptly / and live more wickedlie / we shall bewail / we shall
admonish / we shall reprove / we shall accuse the^ / and they shall bear
their own sin. Their sin shall not hurt us / nether will we absteyne
from the sacraments for their nowghtines / but use the^. In which doi^ge we
shall not communicate with their wickedness / for we shall use the rite and
ceremony as the lord^e commanded / and instituted. And this thing me^t Christ
when he said. The scribes and pharisees do sit in Mo ses chair / what they
bid you do / that do / but as Matthew. 23.
they do / see that ye do not. So Christ commanded the leper whom he hade
cle^sed to go unto the priest. The blessed virgin likewise she might well after
the Luc. 2.
birthe of our savior Christ offer the pair of Turtles or too young pigeons /
because it was so commanded in the law. By this example our men can not hear
mass / because it is a thing contrary to godds word: But let these papists
give unto us the sacraments / as Christ did institute them / and we shall use
the^ / and yet nevertheless reprove their wickedness. Now our men being thus
at all points answered / and ouercommed / do fly to this atlenghth. Though
say they it be a sin to go to Mass and such popish pelf yet it is but a
light sin / and not so severely to be reproved. What (say they) we do many
things which we should not do. but God forgyuithe the^. 2c. To the last I
answer: The goodness of Godd which does forgive sins unto them that be truly
penitent / does not diminishe at all the gretnes of the sin. Wherefore I will
answer only / to that they say / that it is but a light sin. Which thing
whilst they do say / they do not think this with themselves / that all
sins have their proper weight and burden. For doings and the nature of
things done are not to be considered simply of themselves, but they are to be
weyed by godds word and law / by which they arforbidde^: By it / wicked acts
and the do^inge of them ar to be judged: And seeing that the pour of the law
and word of God is all one in all commandments / by it / the weighte /
burden and greatness of sin committed / is to be weyed considered and judged.
S. James therefore in this cause does say. He that Jacob. 2.
has observed the whole law / and does offend in one / is made giltye of
all. Which saying truly is hard and sharp / but most true / and teachith all
me^ that they should not extenuate sin. But this place of James / is not so to
be vndersto^ded / as though August. Epist. 29. ad Hiero.
that all sins were equal and like. That does Augustine truly and plainly
deny: He says that the Stoickes do go about to prove it / when they say /
that all virtues are co^ioyned and knitt together / so that he which has one
of them has all / and he that wa^tith one wa^tith all. For wisdom (say
they) is not fearful / not intemperate / not unjust / therefore it has
joined with it the virtues which be contrary unto these vices: And likewise
justice / stre^ghthe / te^peraunce and other virtues are not unwise / but are
joined with wisdom / wheruppon they do conclude / that all virtues are
conjoined and knitt together. These things / says Augustine / do not Iaco.
3. 1. Joan. 1.
agree with the holy scriptures / which do witness. That in many things we do
all offend / and If we say that we have no sin / we do deceive our selves
and there is no truithe in us. Wherefore seeing that we sin in many things / and
in synnynge we ca^ not have that virtue which is contrary to that sin which
we do committ / and yet it may be that he which fallith in one sin / may be
co^staunt in other virtues / the opinion of these philosophers is false. As for
example: Be it / that one be of an hastye nature / or do exceade measure in
eatinge / and yet he gyuith every man his own / and will give his life in Godds
cause: though this man be fearce / and intemperate / yet is he called a just
man / and a strong man. S. Augustine does also putt away the similitude of
the stoics / which is. That the man does die in the waters / if they be but
half a handful over / his head / as well as he over whose head they are / ten
/ or twenty cubits. This is no apt similitude / says he / therefore let us
take an other more fit for our purpose / of light namely and darcknes.
Certainly when one is in darcknes / the more he does depart and go out of it
and drawith nighe unto light / he begynnith the better to see sumwhat / and so
though that yet he be compassed with darcknes / yet is he sumwhat partaker of
the light. But he that will know more of this matier / let him read that
Epistle of Augustyne: Where he prouith plainly / that all sins are not like /
as the Stoics did think: Now to return to our place / which we did rehearce.
Be that offendith in one / is guilty of all. There is no obseruacion of Godds
Law to be receued with an exception / as though we might chose one part of
it to observe / and separate or set aside the other part at our will and
pleasure to neglecte it. The commandments of the law ar conjoined of the
lord and knitt together / and so given unto us: We must not now disseuer / and
separate the^ as we lust / but without exception we must observe the whole
law. We must consider and look upon the Authority of the law gyuer / which
is Godd / It is of force as well in one commandment / as in the rest. This does
James seame to mean / when he says: Jacob. 2.
He that has said / Thou shall not committ adultery / the same has said /
Thou shall not kill. As if he should say / he is no les contraried in any one
of these commandments / then in an other. And therefore (to add this by the
way) let them well consider what they do which do profes to receive the gospel
/ and yet they do refuse ecclesiastical disciplyne: Whereas the lord / which
has reuealede and opened the gospel unto us by Christ / does appoint
discipline to be a part thereof. These men do sin against the whole law.
The papists do also sin herin / which do preach their parted righteousness /
as meritorius of congruitie. But to return / this is also manifest / that he
that synnith in one / is therefore guilty in all / for that as now by lust and
tentacion he is carried into sum one transgression / and so does sin / even
in like manier should he offend in an other evil / if he were assaulted in the
same sort / and whith that same violence of tentacion. And Augustine in the
place before alleged. does say. That therefore he is made guilty of all /
because he synneth against charity / upon which the obseruacion of the whole
law is grownded. To be short therefore / when we do thus fall into sin / we
must not ligtly tryfle it of and excuse it / saying that it is but light / and
small: for sin is not to be considered of the matier / and manier of the
action only / but of the force pour / and dignity of Godds word which does
forbidd it. And yet les I should seem to be to rigorus and strayte in this
matier of massehauntinge / let there be hadd a consideracion / or difference of
the matier / and doing. And truly I can not see / how this find of sin and
doing ca^ be judged to be light / or small / seeing that it is a transgressio^
committed against the furst table of the law / in which the worship due vntto
Godd is commanded which worshipp being sownde and safe in a man other vices
and sins ar the more easily corrected: And again this being corrupted / all
other acts are most unacceptable unto Godd. Whordo^ by Godds law is to be
punyshed by death / yet is it a sin but against the. ij. table. And what
shall we think then of spiritual whordome? how severely does Godd judge it?
how sharply ought it to be punished? If therefore thou do consider the
commandment which thou breakest / it is of God: If the matier / it is aganist
the furst table and therefore this sin is the more heynus and weighty. Besides
this / our men do count this Mass hauntinge a fault to be either contemned /
or not so depely to be considered in them because they do not sin with mind
will and affection / but as it were compelled and of necessite. But I ask them
/ what manier a violence and compulsion this is through which that necessite
commithe of which they make their excuse? Truly they can not say that it is
any other / then because they would not run into the danger of the loss of
their Goods / their estimacion and life. This is then no absolute necessite
Aristote. Ethi. lib. 3.
but such a one as risith of there own corrupt affection and will, which prouith
that their action is volu^tarie. As Aristotle in his Ethics does say of the
loss which shippmen do suffer in a tempest / which do cast out of their ship
al their Goods when they be in danger of shipp wrack: They seame truly to be
compelled to do it / and yet willingly they do it / and therefore they are said.
To do. because that with deliberacion and advise / they do determine / both
with judgment and will / rather to abide the loss of their goods / the^ of
their life. Which thing as the mariners do wisely determyne / so our men do
folishly / which for the love that they bear to their life / body and goods
do not chose to abide the loss of the^ all / in refusing to come to these
detestable masses / to gayn thereby life / and salvation ever lasting. And so
do they co^mitt doble sin. Furst they sin willingly. The^ they do prefer
earthly things before heavenly / outward things before inward / the body
before the soul / their Goods before God: Which is not done but of such / as
ar the very ^ldre^ of the world. Of affection verily / though they do say nay
/ they do that which they do / but of that inordinate affection which they do
bear to their riches. Wherefore this is no just excuse which they make. For as
well might the Corinthians / even by the very same reason / have said to
Paul. If we do comme unto these feasts where the meats offered unto Idols are
eaten / we do it not with that mind as though we allowed such sacrifices /
but we are compelled thereunto / for if we should avoid these solemn feasts /
we should be taken as sedicius men / evil citizens / discourteous / we should
loose our friends / and most profitable healp and defense / Yea and paradue^ture
our goods and countrith, Paul hearith noone of all these things / but does
sharply reprove the^ / as in the furst epistle which he wrote unto the^ it does
appear. Aaron also by the same reason might have excused the making of the
golden calf / and said / I did it not with my mine Exodus 32.
de / I was compelled / and if I hadd not followed the mind of the poeple /
they would have stoned me. rc. But Moses / who did well perceive that this was
not of an absolute necessite / but did rise of such a corrupt grownd and matier
as neither righteousness does suffer to be received / neither Godd does admit /
he co^demnith the act / and does sharply reprove Aaron for it. These men ought
also to think this: That the mass is as it were the sign and sure mark /
the pleadg / and seal / by which the papists do know who be theirs / from
others. For whether a man gyuith almos / whether he prays / whether he lives
a cha ste life / and so forth / they pass not at all: This only they do
regard / whether he hearith Masses: which thing if they perceive that he does
/ for the whith they think that man to be there own / and on the other part /
to abhor the Mass and not to hear it / is even the beginning of fallinge
from there kingdom / and from Antichriste. Wherefore we may call Mass hearing /
The public profession of popery / the badge of the most vile and filthy
Idolatry which is used in our age. In this therefore / i^ which papists put so
mutch confidence / that they make thereof the very marcke whereby the godly are
known from their men / no Christian must dissemble. For if he do / then does he
publicly profess himself to be a papist / which is even to deny Christ's
gospel: And this to do / is so great a sin / as no man ca^ extenuate by any
blind cloak or reason. But thou wilt say: There be great dangers / of which I
am in present ieoperdie / and I shall also set mi self forth to other most
heavy dan^giers / except I be partaker and do communicate with papists in the
Mass / and such popish Idolatry. I grant that there are dangers / such is
their Tyranny. But remember thou / That Godd has forseene all these dangers
before / and also has showed that they should comme / of which though he were
not ignorante / yet did not his wisdom change his law to have them avoided:
He commanded / and does / that Idolatry shall not be committed but that me^
should fly from it / which commandment he will have kept what so ever peril
does come thereon. Wherefore let us cast our care upon him which has given us
this commandment / for he which does know right well / that these euels are
joined with the obseruinge of his commandments / he will care for them which
for rightuisnes shall be persequuted. Truly the violence / and nature of
persequution and daungiers is not such / that it can change Godds law:
neither that he will have his laws changed for them. Let persequutions be
howsoever they be / yet Godds law remaynith immovable. Let us not seek then
to divide and part ourselves / and our service / between Godd and the deuell /
as though we would give our mind and affection unto Godd: and in popery and
supersticious Idolatries to give our bodies doi^ges / and outward actions unto
the deuell. Our mind is Godds seat / our body is his Temple. Give therefore
to Godd / that which belongith unto him. Think 1. Cor. 6. Mat. 22.

and certain Canon of the holy ghost must now either rule the / or herafter in

Now seeing that we have sufficiently spoken of private men and subjects / in
and through all the parts and members of our distinctions and diuisio^s / it
remaynithe that we should entreat of Princes: for so at the beginning we
ordered our division.

The first is / that they do not enforce nor compel their faithful subjects

Godds ministers / as they are taught to be in the epistle to the Romans / but
Romans 13.
rather the ministers of the devil / of Antichriste / and of their fury. Then
should they be a fear unto them that do well / and not to them that do evil /
neither should they promote the work of God / but the tyranye of Antichriste.

The second is / they must not grant nor suffer / the unfaithful to use
their supersticions and wicked Idolatries which are contrary unto Godds word.
For it is not sufficient / that they do not compel the godly to wicked
supersticio^ and Idolatry / but also they must forbid the same to the
wicked Idolatrours: For not doing of this Salomo^ is greatly accused: Indeed
he did not compelle the Iues to 3. Reg. 1^.
worshipp Idolles / but yet did he permit and suffer his wives and concubines,
which were straungiers, to have their Chapells among the Iues / in which they
worshipped Astaroth / Chamos and such idols / for which cause the lord was so
angry with him / that as he suffered his true worship to be parted and
divided / as he suffered service to be done partly to God and partly to
Idolles. Eue^ so was his kingdo^diuided / part of it came unto his son / and
part to Ieroboa^ the son of Nabat. And again for doing of this / Achaz / and
other wicked kings were reproved of the prophets. Magistrates are apoi^ted to
be the defe^ders / and executours of the first table of the law as well as of
the second: with what observation the^ of justice ca^ a magistrate grant or
suffer Idolatry to be used? It is writo^ that he has the sword to punish
evil things and vices. If it be his part to punis he thieves / and not to
permit them / the same must he do to Idolatrours. Or else we must say that
Idolatry is no such sin and vice as theft is / or that with other vices it
is not to be punished. And that these princes may do this the better / they
must the^ selves take heed that they be clear from these Idolatries and
supersticio^s. Augustine writi^g against the donatistes does i^ many places
notably entreat and handle Psalm. 1.
this sentence of the psalm. And now ye kings be wise be warned ye that
judge the earth. Serve the lord with fear. rc. It is reason and semyng
says he that kings should serve the lord / neither is it spoken of kings
in respect that they are me^ / for so are they bound to observe common laws
eue^ as other me^ are / but as kings they be admonished to use their power
given the^ of God / and their sword to defend the catholic truithe / and to
repress the wicked which do oppugn the church and truithe of Christ: wherefore
it is not lawful for princes to grant unto the wicked and unbelievers their
evil and ungodly Godds service and Idolatries / but they must maynteyn to
their power / those holy rites and ordinances of godds service which do agree
with the word of God / and forbid those which are contrary to yt. I do not
say that they must be to curious in ceremonies / as many are / which would that
i^ any wise all rites and ceremonies should he throughli and in all places of
oone sort / and manier: But this these princes should provide / that the
ceremonies used in there churches should not be contrary to godds word / yea
and that they should most nearly agree therewith / and should make for godly
edyfyinge and dece^t and comelye order in the church: But of their liknes /
and that i^ all places the rites / and ceremonies should be of one form / I do
not think it a thing worthy the labor. For what matter makes it if some men
do receive the sacrament sto^ding / other sittinge / other kneling. And if in
some places whilst the brethere^ do co^municat / a place of the scri pture be
redd / or some psalms be so^g of the people / or other songs of thanks
giving. Nether is it any great matter / when a corpse is carried to the burial /
whether that me^ do follow the hearce holdi^g their peace / or singing of
psalms / or such other things as may edify them that do stand by. These
things are to be left so free that in the churches such may be used / as
shall seem most meet for the edy fyinge of the people. Yea I suppose that this
varietye and change in rytes / and ceremonies / does not a little profit and
help to bring in a true opinion of ceremonies / and to have it kept also:
that is / that me^ should believe that all those ceremonies which the holy scri
pure does not apoint / are not necessary unto salvation / but may be changed
according to the estate of time / and as shall serve for edifyi^g / as they
shall think Godd which have in their hand the orderinge the church. That most
worthy commen wealth of the venetians / which have under there dominions /
many Cities and places in Greece / they do in each of them permit and suffer
the rytes / and ceremonies / Both of the Greek church / and of the Latin
church / for rhose wise men do think / that the dyuersytie in outward
ceremonies which are not taught in Godds word is not hurtefull. I do not
alledg this to allow all such ceremonies as they do permit in those places /
but only to show that they think it not a matier of necessite to have all one
form of ceremonies: The very same thing before the^ did Augustine judge as
in his epistles to Ianuarius / and Cassulanus it does apeare.

The third thing is / that the princes and rulers which do suffer these
unfaithful me^ to dwell i^ their dominions should provide that they might be
taught the truithe: and in this behalf they must not neglect them: for as
the princes do declare their ge^tilnes in suffering the^ to dwell in their
dominions so this their patience must be directed to the glory of God: And
how can that be sought in these vnbeleauers / if they be suffered to abide in
their noughtie opinion without teachinge? Surely by this means in process of
time they be made no whit the better / but a great deal worse then they were
before.

The fourth is / that these princes take Godd head / that by this dwellinge and
conversation which they do grant unto the unfaithful / they do not infecte
the poeple committed to their cure and chardge with their sc^bbe of unbelief
and error. Charytie is to be showed vntostraungiers indede / but yet not so
that they must hurt the poeple among whom they live. And this shall the
princes remedy very well / if that they do not alwais bear with the corrupt
blindness of the vnbelaeuers / but after sufficient teachinge do compel them to
embrace true religion. I say that when they have provided that these
unfaithful have been taught a good while and truly instructed / they must
then enforce and compel them unto those holy and pure rytes and worshippinges
of Godd which are commanded in the scriptures: for princes and rulers must not
always / nor yet to long suffer their cytyzens and subjects / to live
without exercise of godlynes and virtue. The end of political gouernemente is
/ that the subject both should live in felycytie / and also in the practyse of
godlynes / because that godliness and the true worshipp of God is the chefest of
all virtues.

But some man will obiecte against me / and say / if so be that the unfaithful
be not yet persuaded / they shall then embrace truth against their conscience
/ which thing if the prince compel them to do / then he compels them to
sin. Here must we make a difference between the thing that of it self is
sin / and that which is so by chance / by some fortune / or some other
thing that happens / per accidens, as the Logicians do say: for when the Ma
gistrate / in the matter which now we have in hand / does propounde unto these
his subjects / the thing that is right / good / just / and commanded of God
/ prouidinge to have them taught therein / and they will not be taught / if
then he enforces them owtwardlye to use none other order in religion then is
commanded of Godd / and to forsake, all other / he does that which is just
and appertayninge to his office. But that sin is entermingled in this matter
/ truly it is not through the fault of the prince / but it is of the unbelief
of these men / of which the prince can not be justly accused / when he has
diligently done his part / that they should be well instructed. Morouer let them
which do obiecte this consider / that by the same reason that they accuse these
princes we may accuse God: for he does propounde his law / which is most
perfyte to be observed of all men. Should men say? we are weak / our nature is
corrupt and infected / neither can we do these things as thou do command
them / And why do thou then enforce this law upon us? If we do co^tarie to
that which thou do command / verily we sin / and if we go not about to
do it we sin / we shall sin also if we go about to do that which thou
commaundest / for we want of perfection / neither do we obey as we should do:
wherefore do what we will / we shall not avoid sin: unto this the Lord would
answer. The things that I do propounde to be observed of you are just and
perfect / no man can accuse them of wickedness / But in that ye are weak and do
fall / and fail in fulfilling of my law / the fault must not be laid unto
me / for it is of your own malice and corruption / and not through my fault /
for the which I may not withdraw my holy commau^dements / Yet thus I have
provided help for you / Believe in mi only dearly beloved son / and look what
so ever ye want / wherein soever ye do fail / and do not fulfill my
commandments / it shall not be imputed / nor laid to your chardge unto
everlasting death: yea your endeuoyrs and your doings / although they be not
fully perfect and absolute / yet will I accept the^ well / they shall please
me / and I will allow the^. Even so shall the good prince and Magistrate say:
The things which are contained in Gods word / such things as are comlye
and do edify / do I require of you / if your mind and conscience do go
against them / ye can not impute it unto me / I have labored and done my part
that ye should not be ignorant / and miserably perish in ignorance. I have
caused you to be sufficiently instructed / and now will I proceed exhorting /
admonishinge / and demaundinge of you obedience in these things: do you read
the holy scriptures / hear the teachers and pastors / and pray the Lord to
open the eyes of your heart and mind. Thus in aunswering to this objection I
show what a good prince in this case may and must do. That thing also is not
to be passed over of which Augustyne makes mention / that he himself was
sometime of this opinion / that nothing should be viole^tlye done against
heretics / but that they should only be taught / But his mind altered after
that he was admonished by some wise Bishops / how certain cities / which
sometime were altogether corrupted with the error of the Donatistes / were
compelled by the violence of the laws of good Emperors to receive the
catholic faith / and these at length were so syncerelie turned unto the
truth / that they did give to God most hartye tha^ckes for that violent
enforcement / saying that now though they might safelye / yet by no means
would they return any more to such pernicious and hurtful opinions. The
prince therefore / after that he has given them sufficient instruction / if he
shall enforce these men unto the embracing of such rites and ceremonies as are
good and godly indede / he shall do no hurt at all / but much good. I do
mean that this should be practysed only upon such as be cityzens / and
natural borne subjects / or such as being strangers borne / do as denizens
dwell in their dominions / and so by privilege have the benefit of their
cou^trithe: Otherwise if they be but strau^giers which do pass thorough their
countrithe / or such as do come either to bye or to sell marchaundize / there
is no such violence to be showed toward the^. And yet this thing they must
take head of even in the^ / that they do not seduce their people and subjects
which are of a good judgment / that they do not infect them with vice and
error. The Israelites / as I think / ar in this point to be followed. They
did admit no stranger to be as a Iue / or proselyte / neither did they give
unto any the liberty of their countrith / except he did first circu^cise
himself / admit Moses law / did communicate / and became partaker with them
in their Sacrifices / submitting himself to their discipline: Which thing /
seeing it was well and diligently observed of them / why should not our princes
do even the same? That they should suffer no Citezen / nor subject / either
natural / or stranger born / but that they should compel and enforce him / to
receive such religion / and observe such rites and ceremonies / agreing with
Godds word / as they by common authority have establyshed. Now will I speak
of those princes and Rulers / which are under these chief Rulers. Whom I do
divide into two sorts. Either they are such as have Jurisdiction / pour / and
authority / which comes to them by descent from their Auncetours / or else
committed unto them of Emperors / Kings / and common welthes: Either else they
have no Jurisdiction nor Rule over others / neither by descent from their
auncetours / nor by commission from other higher princes / but only are taken
and esteemed as men of worshipp / for the auncientnes of their house and blud /
or for their riches. This last sort do not differ at all in a manner from
private men / of whom I have spoken before / for these are mere subjects as
they are. Therefore (I do suppose) that the former Rules / appointed unto private
men and subjects are to be committed unto the^ / to be observed of the^ / in
such manner as I have before declared. But of this other sort of Princes and
Rulers / of which some by right of inheritance / some by virtue of office
committed unto them / are Rulars and governors of countrithes / cities and
places. Of these I do say and pronounce this / That in matters which do belong
to Godd and true Religion / they ought to do no other things / but those /
which I have already showed that they must do / which are mere / absolute /
and the higher princes and Rulars. For it is not lawful for them / no not at
the commandment of their higher Princes and Lords / to compel those
subjects over whom they have rule / to receive wicked Religion and
supersticion / neither to permit the unfaithful in the places where they do
bear Rule / to have their ungodly Idolatries and supersticions. This must they
not do / no though they were (I say) thereunto commanded by their higher
princes and Lords / of whom / and under whom / they have their authority.
But if thou will say / that they must obey their higher poures / I will grant
that / but (as the saying is) vsque ad Aras, that is until they do come to
matters of Religion / and until they do command in Religion things
contrary to Gods word and truth. For when they shall command that which
is against Godd / and is hurtefull to the conscience of man / these magistrates
must not obey the^. For these under Rulars are called into a part of the cure
and charge of the good gouernemente of the country / by the force of their
dignity and office: They must not therefore putt those things in execution /
which are against Godd / and are hurtefull to their country: Yea they ought
both to persuade by reason / and to defend by pour the contrary. The
Lacedaemonians / when they which hadd ouercomme them / did demand of them
such things as were against the civil laws and liberty of their city /
They answered / If ye do command us to do things which are more weighty and
grievous then death / we will rather dye then do them: Thus ought these under
Rulars answer their higher Lords / when they do command them to do things
which are to the defacing of Godds glory and truth / and to the wounding and
vnquieting of the consciences of their subjects / which things are more
weyghtie and grievous then death indeed. In Cyuile things they may give place
to the unjust commandments and decrees of their higher Lords / but that
ought they not to do in the cause of Godd / and pure Religion. The Machabees at
such time as the Iues were under the Rule of the Macedonians (Antiochus /
Demetrius / and Alexander / I mean) which princes did lead the people away
from the true worship of God / and from the service taught in his word / would
not obey them. But that house and tribe of the prestes' called Asmonei, which
in dignity were next unto the house and stock of the Kings / and bare the
chief Rule next unto it / les that the true worship of Godd commanded and
taught in the law / and which hadd been retained and used in their country /
shul^ be thus leafte and forsaken / they did Rebel against those kings as the
history does witness. But if this history for the insufficiency of the
authority of the bocke (which yet is a ^rue history / as Josephus also does
witness) will not suffice to prove this matier: Then let us consider what Ioiada
the bishopp did in the days of Athalia: She hadd by violence obtained the
kingdomme / and so was she the supreme 4. Reg. 11.
ordinary pour: But yet he sturred up a commotion against her / And he
brought the Son of Asa / King Ioas / I mean (who was saved by him from her
bluddy sword) into the kingdom: For he knew that by Gods word the kingdom
was given to the house of Judah / He perceived also that she went about to have
all good Religion / and true godlynes / utterly overthrown. Therefore as she had
unjustly shedd innocent bludd / eue^ so he most iustlye commanded that she
should be slain. King Ezechias also / was in subjection to the King of the
Assyria^s / 4. Reg. 18.
for Achaz his father hadd submitted him self unto him / and did not only pay
him tribute / but also for his plea^ure did change Godds Religion: for when he
went to Damasco to meet this King / he commanded that an altar should be
made at Jerusalem / after the patron and fashion of that which he hadd seen
at Damasco. This King Achaz his son / godly Ezechias / perceyuinge that
these things which his father hadd done / were repugnant and contrary unto
Godds word / hurtefull also to the consciences of his subjects / he (I say)
did fall away from the King of the Assyrians / which yet was now his superior
and higher pour. Indeed he sought first to pacify him with gifts / which
thing when he could not do / then to the uttermost of his pour he did defend
him self / and his people against him. Nevertheless in this matter sedicion
must be avoided so much as may be / and these princes must not under the
color and cloak of Religion / seek their own gain and honor: but here only
let the^ resist / that nothing be done contrary to Godds word / and not for
those things which are done to hinder their ambicion. Of this corrupt
affection if they be clear / and only for Religions sake do resist the
wicked proceadinges of their higher princes and Lords / let them not think
that they do herin any unrighteousness at all. But if one will obiecte and
say: This may not be / for all men are commanded to obey the higher poures.
I answer / It is true Romans 13.
indeed that the holy scriptures do commau^de / that every soul should obey
the higher poures / but so far as by Godds word it is lawful to obey / and no
further. For the holy scriptures do likewise say / that the Rular is not any
fear to them that does good / but to them that do evil. Wherefore seeing these
princes / in this case by their endeuoir and labor / do promote that which is
good / they do well and not evil: and so ought they for this doing to be
without fear of the higher pour / because that herin they do not resist
against them / with that Resistaunce which is forbidden. Will thou (says he)
be without fear of the pour? do well then / and so shall thou be praised of
the same: If these princes and rulars do defend godlynes and religion / they
do good / then by the judgment of Gods word they are without fear of the
pour / and do deserve praise of their higher poures and lords. But if thou do
evil (says Paul) then fear the pour / for he bears not the sword for
naught / but is the minister of Godd to take vengeance on them which do evil.
Thus does this place arm the minds and consciences of these inferior princes
of whom I speak / that they should not fear their higher poures / when for
the defense of Gods religion / they do resist and not obey their wicked
commandments. If any will now thus say against me. He that has the kinglye
and supreme authority / unto whom by oath I do owe obedience / commands
these things / and therefore I must obey. I answer that thou art not bound
herin to keape any such oath or promis. For when he commands those things
which are against God / he does not the office of Gods minister / to him
the^ therein thou do owe neither faith nor obedience. Again if thou will ask
/ By what right may these under rulars and inferior magistrates / thus set
them selves against the higher princes / which have the very supreme right
and pour to defend pure and godly Religion / and the true faith. I
answer. That the electours of the Empire / and the Princes of Germany / and
the fre cities / do it by the Imperial pour and right / which is committed
unto them: And that the Magistrates and Rulars which are in kingdoms / they do
and darre do it / by the Kinglye pour and right likewise committed unto them.
For Emperors and Kings / and such higher poures / have therefore chosen and
taken these under Rulars and officers / as it were into a part of their Rule /
to be their helpers / in administringe and ordering their businesses and charge
/ to the end that Justice might florishe so much the more. And even so from
the beginning pour and Rule was given unto these / that they should rule the
common wealth / for that part thereof / which was committed unto them /
iustlye / vprightlye / and godly. Whereof the Emprour in the Code does say /
that if he should command any thing against right / he would not that any
such decree of his should avail in judgments. The very same thing is to be
said / where a king or such which do retain the supreme authority / do
command or determyne any thing against right. Not unworthily is Traianus
the Emperor therefore commended / who when he delivered the sword to a Rular
in his Empire / said: If I do command Just things / use this for me / but
if I do require unjust things / use it against me. But on the contrary part /
Gregory the great / Bishop of Rome / can not in this behalf be praised / but
dispraysed / and accused: Who saying that the law which Mauritius the
Emperor had made was unjust / which was / That no man entangled with the
matters of the common wealth / or which was appointed to the wars / might be
made a priest or a mo^ck / he wrote to the Emperor / That after that he hadd
seen his law / he was wonderfullye afraid and astonished / And therefore he
desires him to diminishe somewhat of the rigor of the law / or else to change
it altogether: But yet he added / That as touching himself / after that he
has now done his office in admonishing him / now for the obedience which he
does owe unto him / he would publishe his law / as he hadd commanded. This
act surely can not, but be reproved in this Busshopp. Again here thou will
happily say. What if the higher Prince will not allow me to do mine office /
or does reuokethis part of mine office? Truly no man ca^ take that from thine
office / which God has commanded the to do in it. No man can discharge the of
that duty / wherewith God charge the in thine office / wherefore so long as
thou bear thine office / do thou the duty that longs to it. Many there
are which do think / that when this dealinge and doing of the inferior
magistrate against the higher Rulars is thus straightly required / That Godds
Religion is not to be promoted after this manier by the^ / but rather / that
they do sufficientlye the thing which belongs unto them / if they do forsake
their office / and give over their Rule and authority. So do not I think /
Thy dignity and office is not so lightly to be given over. Thou do give over
thine office / because thou w^t not strain thy self therein to promote the
glory of Godd: And this is to depart and fall from thy vocacion: which thou
ought not to do / especially when thou do plainly see / that thy room and
place / shall be bestowed upon those / which are wicked and both do / and will
oppress the kingdom of God. These men must abide therefore in their offices / so
long as they be not putt out of them by the higher poures / and strongly must
they defend the glory of God in them.

Now when I on this manner do entreat of these things / I do not make or show
an easy way to stir up sedicions. But this only I do seek / and care for
/ That those things which do belong unto Matt. 22.
Godd / should be given unto Godd: and those things which are belonging unto
Caesar / should be given unto Caesar. If the wordly substance and riches of men
were required and asked by the higher poures / I would council to give the^.
But in those things which do belong unto the worshipp of Godd / I say / that
they must not yealde to the wicked requests of their higher Rulars and lords:
here is no place to be given to the^ / but in our own civil matters we must
yealde / if to yealde in them be not against Gods law. In which case Naboth
is to 3. Reg. 21.
be excused / which would not grant his vy^eyard to the King: He did it not
of covetousness / or of to great a desire which he did bear to the things of
the world / but because he did know that in gyuing away of his vineyarde so /
Gods law should be broken / by which he hadd appointed / that the feeldes
and possessions among the people of Israel / should remayn in their tribes and
kindreds / as they Number. 33.
were justly distributed at the beginning. This law of God would King Achab
have broken / and thereto required he the consent of Naboth / which he with a
good and a safe conscience could not do / and therefore would not. But halas /
sorrow it is to behold / how that there are many Dukes / Earls / and such
princes / from whom if an Emperor or a King would take their dominions /
lands / lordshipps and inheritance / they would leave nothing undone / yea
they would do all that they could do / to defend their own / and to resist
their unrighteous doing: But when the kingdom of God is assaulted by
tyrauntes, and the gospel and bequest of the bludd of Christ taken violently
and wretchedly away from them / and from the children of Godd which are
committed to their tuition and defense / they will do nothing at all. Yea when
they are required of their higher poures / as ministers of their fury / to
destroy and overthrow the gospel / then they neither stir nor speak any
thing at all / but do as they are bidde^. In their own cause they can fight /
and rebel / but in Gods cause / they are as it were no princes nor Rulers.
Whereby we can not think any other thing of them / then this / That they do
not at the heart esteem the gospel of Christ.

Now this is remaining / that I should answer A confuta ^ion of the ^laces
alleged.
unto those reasons which were put forth at the beginning to prove that the
dwelling together of the faithful with the unfaithful is lawful / and
confute them. First / the example of Christ is set against us / which did eat
and drink familiarlye with scribes / pharisees / publicanes / and sinners. We
must remember that Christ was not only strong / but the chief head of all
them which be strong. He could so profit them which were evil / that their
evil should not hurt him / and therefore might use familiarity with the
wicked. Even so there is no cause to the contrary / but that they which be
learned and constante in the truth / such as can prof^t the unfaithful by
their conversation and familiar being with them / and not be hurt by it them
selves (as we have admonished before) may be conuersaunt with the vnbeleauers
and wicked.

The second place is / Paul would not that the faithful married unto an
unbeliever should depart / 1. Cor. 7.
if the unbeliever will dwell together with the other. This I do also
acknowledge / as before I have said: for unto the^ / al necessary businesses /
especially those which are ordained of God / are to be done. And yet in that
place which is here alleged / Paul is not so to be understood without
exception / as these me^ do judge: for if the vnbeleuig married parson / should
continually move the faithful to Idolatry / or should not cease to blaspheme
Christ / and provoke the other to commit like blasphemy / so long as they did
live toge there / this joint life in mariadge were not to be continued: for this
were not to dwell together / but to conspire together against Christ: Paul
therefore speaks of such cohabitacion as is laufull without such soliciting
or mouinge to evil and blasphemye.

An other sentence of Paul is brought which he writes to the Corinthians /
where he teaches that 2. Cor. 5.
all covetous parsons / evil speakers / dronckardes / whoremu^gars / and such
like / are not to be avoided / for then should they have gone out of the
world. But he would / that we should keep our selves from the^ / which being
called brethren / are infected with these vices. As concerning this place / we
must consider the mind and purpose of Paul. First he did perceive that for
the necessity of life it could not be that the faithful should avoid the
company of all which at that time were unbelievers / for the greater part of
men at that ceason was without Christ / and they being avoided of our men /
could not thereby have been made the better / But into the^ which before were
brethren / both sorrow and shame was driven / when they did see that they were
now shonned of the godly / to whom as they were before right dear / so with
them they were familiar. And by this means the church was not evil reported /
neither for clokinge of evil among themselves / nor for to severe separatinge
themselves from them which were not yet converted: seeing that they lived with
the unbelievers / partly for the necessity of life / partlye to turn them to
the gospel of Christ: wherefore this sentence does make nothing at all against
those things which we have already spoken.

Much less makes that for them which they do bring in / that Abraham did
becomme a straungier among the heathen and Idolatrours: first that which Gene.
12.
Abraham did / even by the calling and commandment of God he did it. Again
he was of such knowledge and consta^cie in the truithe that he coul de be
conuersau^te whith the vnbeleauers with out hurtinge of him self / and with
much profyting of the^. For he carried about with him the name of god and his
holy and true worship / whither so ever he went. And the very same thing / may
we answer of Lot.

For if Lot went to Sodom / with a Good mind Gene. 13.
to teach the^ true faith and godly life / he owght not to be accused
therefore / for it was well done / yea it was the providence of God toward the
Sodomyts / that they might be better taught / and ernestly called unto
repentance. So does God admonish before he destroieth. So Abraham was sent
among the Cananites. On this sort to go among the wicked / and unbelievers is
lawful and laudable. But if Lot went to Sodo^ only because the pleasant
commodytie of the place pleased him / he did not well. Neither indede did his
going thither happen luckelie / for he was led away captive / so that he was
in need to be rescued again by Abraham. Gene. 14.
And likewise when God burned the City / he was compelled even against his
will to forsake it.

Of Naaman I shall not need to speak now / for 6
of him I have spoken enough before. I suppose likewise 7
that the ca^se is open and plain inoughe / where fore many of them which were
healed of Christ were sent from him to their own country / and kindred / to
publishe and declare among the^ / what hade happened unto the^. This now
remains / that I should peculiarly speak of the Iues / and heretics. For
these too kinds of me^ do in all places this day live among / and do dwell
together with the Christians.

As concerning the Iues / there be certain reasons Of the Iues
why they are to be borne withal and suffered. Of which Augustine / among
others / does make mention in many places. First / they above all other sorts
and nations of men had the promise made unto them. Neither are they all yet
utterly to be despayred of / for the root remaynethe into the which they may
be ingrafted again / and now and the^ some of them / though not many in
Nombre / do come unto Christ. Paul says to the Romans / that partly
blindness is happened in Israel / as if he Romans 11.
would say / not upon all / nor for ever. And afterward he says / when the
fulness of the gentyles is comme / the^ all Israel shall be saved: unto that end
therefore the lord saves / and preseruith them unto this day. And that thou
sholdest not think that this place is to be understood allegorically of the
spiritual Israel / Paul teaches it as a mystery / and does recite the
prophecy of Esaie / in which it is Esa. 59.
said: That then all the iniquite of Jacob shall be taken away. Besides this

but yet beloved for the fathers. And Augustine expou^dinge the history of the
prodigal son / says / that he does represent the gentiles / for as he
went into a far country / so the gentyles did depart so far from God /
that they worshipped Idols as by a public order and custom co^menlye
received: But the elder son / by who^ the people of the Iues is signified /
went not far away / but was in the field / not in his fathers house verylie
/ which is the church / but in the field / for the Iues are occupied / and
co^uersaunte about the letter of the scriptures / they understand them whith
an earthly and fleshly mind. And therefore it is said / that he was in the
field: At the beginning he went not into the house / but at the last he shall
enter / and be called also: And always Augustine bringith this sentence to
persuade Lib. de fide reru^ inuisib. cap. 6 Psalm. ^59
men to suffer the Iues / which is written in the 58. psalm. as he no^bred the
Psalms. ^ley them not / lest my poeple do forget / but scater the^ abroad.
etc. The son of God prays the father / that the Iues might not be utterly
slain and destroyed but scatered abroad through the world. Other countries
and nacyo^s / being subdued of the Romans received their laws and rytes /
and so became Romans / but the Iues although that they also were ouercomme of
the Romans / yet were they never made Romai^s / neither i^ ordinances /
laws / nor religion. They do keep their own law (so far as they ca^) eue^
unto this day: They wander about dispersed and scattered abroad / neither do
they forget the law of Godd / they have it / not to observe it indeed / but
only they do read yt / and they do also reteyne certain signs / as
Circu^cisio^ and other ordinances / by which they are known from others. But
they offer no sacrifices / for to sacrifice was lawful only at Jerusalem. And
thus it seems that the lord has set upon them a sign / as he did upon
Cain / which slew his brother Abell.

Neither is this their dispersion among all the nations of the world
unprofitable for us. They are branches broken of / and we are grafted in their
place / which thing whilst we do behold / we must acknowledge the justice of
God toward them / and his grace toward us: And we must take heed / that we
be notlykwise cut of through unbelief / for the which they were broken away.
There is another commodity besides this that commith of this their dispersio^
which is / that they do keep our books / the holy bible I do mean. These they
do carye about with them / they read them / and though they believe not /
because they are blinded / yet do they confess that these wrytinges are true.
And so though they be our enemies in their mind / yet the books which they
have and do reverence / are our witnesses. wherefore I ca^ not maruayle enough
at those me^ which do persequute and hate the tongue of the Hebrews / and the
Hebrewe bibels / and do burn them / when as Augustine in his book / De
doctrina Christiana, does bid / that we should go to the truithe of the lib.
2. ca. 11.
Hebrew tongue / if we do doubt in any place of our translations. The self
same thing does Hierome teach in many places. But they say that these
books are corrupted of the Iues. Hear I think good to answer with Hierome.
Either says he they did this before the coming of Christ / and the
preachinge of the Apostles / or after: if before / it is marvel that when
Christ / the Apostles / and Paul / did reprove most sha^full faults in the
Iues / that they would have kept in silence so great and heinous a sacrilege
as this: surely if it hade been so / they would have reproved yt. But if it
was done after Christ's asce^sio^ / they would the^ chiefly have corrup ted
those places which do make me^cio^ of Christ / and those which Christ / and
his Apostles did allege. But those remain safe and incorrupt / the same
sense and meaning of the^ is in their bible in which they were recyted of
Christ / and his Apostles (for about the words they were not so curious)
wherefore it is not like / that they have corrupted any other places at all in
the holy books of the scripture. Yea if a man does justly behold the^ / he
shall see that they have many moo testimonies and sentences for us / more
plain / I say / then our common translation has / as in the. 2. Psalm. kiss
the son / where ours has / lay hold of knowledge. In like manner the whole.
53. of Esaie / which does most plainly prophecy of Christ / remaynith
vncorrupt. The books therefore are not corrupted. Yea they could not have
corrupted those books though they would / but it should be easyly espied: for
there be of them many most awn cient in written hand / which have been kept
most diligently of Christians. But let us return to the profyt that
Augustine speaks of. Many might^e think / that those things which are
spoken of the old people were vain and feigned / and likewise those things
which we do tell owte of the prophettes / except they did see the Iues
themselves yet living / and remayninge / with their books / which do bear
witness to the things that we do speak: wherefore though the Iues be blinded
in mind / and in heart are our enemies / yet even them and their books we have
most plain witnesses of our faith. Ask the^ of the prophettes whom Christ
does allege / they grant them to be true. Ask them of the understanding
of the^ / in yt they are ignoraunte / because they are blinded. And among all
other witnessinges / that witness which is given of a ma^s enemy is of
greatest weight / and makith most for him: Of such witnesses truly the lord
has provided good stoore for his church. For we have not only the books of
the Hebrews to make for us / but also the verses or rydles of the Sibylles /
which were of an heathen poeple. It is not to be thought / that our elders
feigned those verses: for Sibylles books were even commune / in all men's hands /
in the time of Eusebius the bishop of Cesarea / of Lactantius / and of
Augustine. All which do use / and alledg them. But if they hade alleged false
and counterfett verses / the heathen me^ which then excelled in knowledge / and
were very many also in number / they would ha ue reproved them as vayn men and
liars. If then men will give this unto the verses of the Sibylles that they be
incorrupt / much more is it to be given to the books of the Hebrews. Thus
has it pleased the lord to defend and arm his church / yea eue^ with the
testimonies of his aduersaires. Wherefore let the Iues be suffered among the
Christians / both for the promis which they have of the salvation to comme to
their stock / and also for the commodities which they do carry with them /
such as I have rehearsed. And for this cause / they be not only by laws
suffered / but also they have their Synagoges granted unto them: As in the
Nouellis Constitutionibus of Justinian / and in the Decrees / it does appear:
But this is permitted under such condition that they should not have moo
Synagoges then they hadd before / nor greater: Yet may they repair them that
fall into decay: This was granted to them / because that in their
co^gregacions / there is no impiete / nor wickedness committed: They do but read
only the books of the holy scripture / and do publicly pray. In which
thing yet the Magistrates and Bushopps / do evil / which do not diligently
search / take heed / and provide / that they do nothing else in their
congregations indeed / then that I have spoken of: for they should by all means
take heed / that in their public and common prayers / exhortations and
readinges they do not speak evil of Christ our lord and Godd. Which thing
seeing they do not / both the Magistrates and the Bushopps are in great fault.
Unto Turcks this ought not to be granted / that they should gather them selves
together in congregations to do their Godd service / because that in the same
they read neither the old Testament / nor the new / but only their own
blasphemus and filthy Alcorane. Morouer the Iues should be forbidden the
practice of their exchau^ges / and their vsuries. For not without mutch
dishonesti and shame / do they afflicte many poor Christians therewith. But
Christian Princes and Rulars do take tributes / and great taxes for these gaynes
of usury and shameful couetusnes of the Iues / so far ar they from
forbidding them these wicked practices. Again Christian princes do not provide
to have the Iues which do dwell under their dominions taught in Gods truithe:
which indeed is an evil negligence in them: for truly they ought to compel
the Iues to comme unto the godly sermons of the Christians / and that often
times. Else if they be left in this point neglected / they do wa^e daily wors
and wors / and lytill yea no hope at all is there to be hadd of their
conuercion. These princes are likewise bownd to take head that the Iues do
not corrupt the Christians / which are under their Rule / that they do not
seduce them and bring them into Iuishnes. Neither should the weaker sort of
Christians have any familiarity with them / but only such Christians as be
learned / and constant in the truithe. And that for such causes / as I have
alleged before. Last of all it is meet and convenient / that they should be
known from the Christians by their array / or some such outward sign / les
any man at unawares should be conuersaunt with them / as though they were
Christians. And thus mutch of the Iues shall suffice. Now will I entreat of
Heretics.

This word Haeresis, is derived of the Greek word / (...), which signifies
to chose / to pick / or to cull out. For heretics do chose out / unto
themselves sum doctrine which is contrary to the holy scriptures / and do
obstinatly defend the same. Unto this evil they are brought / either because
they do not know the holy scriptures / either because that though they do know
them yet they do contemn and despise them either else because they do apply
themselves to get sum honor or riches by this mean. Wherefore Augustine says.
He is an heretic which either enuentith / Lib. de vtilit. crede^.
or folowith falls and new opinions for any worldly commodity / and chiefly to
get himself glory and autorite. But of Heresy I will make this definicion.
Heresy / is a choice and obstinate defense / What he resie is.
of certain doctrynes which are contrary vntto Godds word / springinge /
either of the ignorance / or of the contempt of the holy scriptures / to get
thereby aduau^tag / or honors. There are four kinds of causes in this
definicion. The formal cause is / chosinge and defending of picked doctrynes.
The material part or cause is picked doctryns contrary to Godds word. For he
that beleauith no doctrine at all / is godles / and not an Heretic. The cause
efficient by which they are moved to Heresy is / ignorance and contempt of
the holy scripture / and lust or couetus desire. The end whi men fall to
Heresy is / to obtain honors / and riches: For they do abhor the Cross
which folowith the preachinge of the gospel / and as Paul says / Their belly
/ is their god. Phil. 3. Quest. in Matthew. quest. 11.
Augustine has also this division. Evil catholics are they / which do live
otherwise the^ they say that they do beleaue. Schismatiques are they / which
for diversity in opinion do divide and separat the church / for (...), is to
divide. Heretics are they / which persevere / and continue in that schism.
But in an other Lib. 2. contra Cresco. cap. 7.
place he says. That Heresy / does differ from schism. For a Schism / is a
strife which risith upon diversity of sentences. Neither can a dyuiding or a
schism be / onles they which do make it do think and hold contrary things.
But Heresy is / an inueterat schism. Saint Paul obseruith no such diversity
/ for he uses these too words for one thing. Now that 1. Cor. 11.
ye se what Heresy is / consider well wether that the papists be heretics /
or no? They themselves do stoutly say that they be none. Yea and sum other
there are / which dare affirm / that the papists do differ from us only in
certain abuses of ceremonies / and not in the doctrine of faith. But how far
these me^ do err from the truithe / it shall forthwithe appear. For I will
plainly prove / that the papists are Heretics / and do maintain Heresy
against certain principal doctrines of our faith.

Furst in the Article of Justification / the papists do pick out unto
themselves this doctrine: That a 1 The Papists are heretics
man is not justified by faith only / but by good worcks also. Which doctrine
is contrary to the holy scriptures. Paul teachith thus. We hold that a man is
Justified by faith / without the deeds of the Romans 3. Gal. 2.
Law. Again he says. We do know that a man is not Justified by the deeds of
the law / but by the faith of Jesus Christ. And Peter / whom Paul did the^
withsto^d / did not speak against this doctrine. Of the Iues / also he writith
thus. For being ignorant Romans 10.
of Gods righteousness / and goinge about to establishe their own righteousness /
they were not obedient to the righteousness of God. In which place he settith
these two righteousnesses / the one / against the other / the righteousness of
faith / against the righteousness of worckes / so that the one excludith the
other. The same thing he does where speaking Romans 11.
of Justification he says. If it be of grace / the^ is it not of worcks / if
it be of worcks / the^ is it no more Phil. 3.
grace. To the Philippians he plainly says / that the worcks which are wrought
before Regeneracion / can not justify / for he does count them to be but
loss and dunge / which truly he would not have done / if they hadd such pour
and virtue / that they could justify. This is most plain / that men before
regeneracio^ are evil / and then must this sentence of Christ's sto^de true.
An evil tree ca^ not bring forth good fruit. For how can it be / that they
which are Mat. 7.
dead as concerning righteousness / can of the^ selves go any thing forward
unto their new birthe: And we all were such / eue^ dead through sin / and
the children of wrath. The Epistle writon to the Hebrews Ephesians. 2.
does witness / That without faith it is impossible to please God: And to the
Romans Paul Hebre. 11.
says. That what soever is not of faith is Sin. This is the doctrine of the
scripture concerning this Romans 14.
matier. The papists (as I said) do teach clean contrary doctrine / a^nd
do obstinatly defend it / notwithsto^ding that they be admonished of their
error by the holy scriptures / by the aunciente fathers / as Hierom / Augustine
/ and others / by the godly Councils / as Africanum / Mileuitanum / Arausicanum
/ And now also being admonished thereof by us / yet will they not leave their
error: Wherefore by the former definition of Heresy / they are proved heretics.

An other doctrine also they do hold which is this. That the worcks which men
do after regeneracion / are meritorius of their own worthiness unto everlasting
life / And that they do fulfill the law of God. Yea they be not content to
say this only / but they add. That men can do more good worcks the^ the law
of Godd requirith. For (say they) to live a syngle life / to preach the
gospel freely / me^ are not commanded by any expres commandment of Godd.
This they do teach / and obstinatly defend. But we do lern out of the holy
scriptures / that The afflictions of this life / are not worthy of the glory
/ which Romans 8.
shall be showed upon us. He speakith hear of the best kind of worcks / even of
sufferinge martyrdom. Besides this eiche man does feel him self bound

mortal me^ / that did ever fulfill those commandments. For the prophet
says: that our rightuousnesses / are as the clothe stained with the flowers
of Esa. 64.
a woman. And Christ would have us all / yea even the blessed virgin / and the
Apostles themselves to pray / forgive us our trespasses. James adds / in
many things we all do sin. John says. And if Mat. 6. Jacob. 3. 1. Joan.
(...).
we say we have no sin / we do deceive our selves. This do we learn in the
holy scripture / of our continual synnynge: they teach not then that we can
do any thing more then we should. But here the papists do seek startinge
hooles / and say that they which live a sole life / they which do preach the
gospel frelie / do more the^ the law commands / as I sayde-But this is not
true / for they which have the power to live a sole and chaste life / and do
know that in this kind of life they shall more paynfully and profitably labor
in the preachinge of the gospel of Christ the^ otherwise. They are bownde to
take it on the^ and to live in it. For if they do yt not / it is certain that
they love not God with all their heart / by cause they should then leave undone
somewhat that they might do / to^ the glory of his name / and would not. Like
is to be said of the^ / which might preach the gospel frelye / and do se
that it shall be for the increase of the kingdom of Godd / and do it not.
Wherefore saying the papists do both think and teach otherwise in this
matier then the holy scripture does teach / and do defend their error with
an obstinate mind they are heretics.

They do chose unto them selves also an other doctrine / which is / that they
which be regenerat / must (...)
always doubt of their salvation. But Christ / the Apostles / and the whole
scripture / do teach clean contrary / he that beleuithe in me (says
Christ) has everlasting life. If he has it / how ca^ he doubt Joan. 6.
of yt then? And it is written in the Acts. To him give all the Prophets
witness / that all they which Act. 10.
believe through his name / shall receive remission of sins. And to the
Romans / who^ he has called / Romans 8.
them also he justified / whom he justified / the^ he also glorified: But here
the papists have this shifte / A man must not doubt of Gods promises (they
say) but he must doubt of the infirmity of his flesh / that he can not do
those things which are to be done / to obtain the promises of Godd. Butt we
be admonished by Abraha^s example / that we should Romans 4.
not in beholding of our imbecyllitie / fainte in faith / nor fall from
beleauinge certainly the truithe of the promises: he considered not the barren
womb of Sara / nor his own old and effoebled body / he stackered not at the
promise of God through unbelief / but became strong in faith / and did give
glory unto God / knowinge that he was sufficiently able to perform those
things which he promised. 2c. Therefore by faith is the enheritaunce given that
it might come of grace / that the promise might be certain Romans 4.
and sure: for if the certayntie of our salvation did ha^ge on our merytes and
worthiness of our worckes / it should always stumble / and be in dau^gier of
overthrow. Thus the papists do spoil men of healthful hope / and make me^
doubt / if not despair / which is not to be done: For that nature of hope may
not be inuerted which Paul teaches to be such / that it does not make a man
ashamed: if then we do certaynlye Romans 5.
hope and look for life everlasting / we shall not be deceived: and sei^g it
is the holy ghost that bearithe witness unto our spret / that we are the

justified conscience / and knowith Roma. 5.
himself to be in safety / for Godd is his iustifier / and who shall condemn
him / whom Godd does justify. Against al these manifest testimonies of the
holy Roma. 8.
scriptures / these men do teach their contrary doctrine / and do obstinatly
defend it / wherefore they are heretics.

Moreover they do teach that every man must satisfice for his sins in this
life / which if he do not / then must he go to purgatory: And that by the
pour of the Keys committed unto them / they can turn the everlasting
punishment in to a temporal. If therefore satisfaction be not made whilst a man
is in this life / he shall do it / when he is goone out this life. But against
this / the holy scriptures do Psalm. 32. Romans 4.
teach. Blessed are they whose vnrighteousnesses are forgyuen / and whose
sins are covered. What blessedness / I pray you should this be / if they which
be reconciled unto Godd / should be bownde to sustain such pains and
punishments. When a Sinner does repent (says Godd by the Prophet) The sins
that he has done / shall not be thought upon. But Godd will think upon
them / if it be Ezech. 18.
true that either a man must satisfice / or go to purgatory / if Godd will so
sharply punish them by such pains as they say are in purgatory. It is
writon in the reuelacion. Blessed are the dead which do Apoc. 14.
dye in the lord / eue^ so says the spret / that they rest from their
labors. They which do dye in the lord / that is the beleauers / how do they
rest from their labors / if it be so that they must yeat be vexed in
purgatory? Christ our Savior when he did forgive sins said. Thy faith
has made the safe: go thy Luc: 7. Joan. s. Lnc. 23. Phil. 1.
ways / sin no more. To the theif he said. This day thou shall be with me
in paradise. Paul desired to be loosed / and to be with Christ. How chauncith
it that here is no mention made of purgatory* In the old law / there were
sacrifices ordeigned / for princes / prests / for the Nazarites / for the
lepars / for gelousie / for the sin of ignorance / and many such like. How
happens it that there was no sacrifice appoi^ted for the dead? The church
truly (as we also do grant) has keys committed unto it. And these are /
the preachinge of the gospel / that is the forgyuenes of sins to the^ which
do beleaue in Christ Mar. 16.
and the threateninge of condemnacio^ / through which heaven is shutt against
the vnbeleauers. One key is the promis / an other key is faith / by these two
keys heaven is opened to the penitent. These keys Christ did delyure when he
said: goo in to the whole world / and preach the gospel to every creature / he
that beleaueth and is baptized / shall be saved. Those ministers do occupy these
keys which do preach the gospel. But here is no mencio^ made of altering of
Gods judgments / nor of turninge of punishments. Christ our savior / by
that one sacrifice of his body / ones offered for all ever / did work
perfect salvation / and made a perfect and consummate end of sacrificing for
sin: where then is their enuented satisfaction for sin? Yea who does not
see / that this their doctrine does withdraw from Christ / the fulness of that
his satisfaction with which he satisficed for us? when they do say that it is
not sufficient / except we do add ours also. And this their wicked error they
go about to color / because the old fathers used often times this word /
satisfaction. But they will not see / that the fathers me^t thereby / to
satisfice the church / when they were received publicly to repentance / and
not to satisfice to Godd. Except thou wilt say that to satisfice is nothing
else / but when one does make himself approved unto an other man. For even so
are we said to satisfice to Godd / when as after our co^uercion and turning to
his grace / we do live godly for his pleasure / to aproue our selves unto him /
as his children. Thus satisfactions / are signs of the forgyuenes of sins
and of true repe^tau^ce. But (as I said) these me^ do both think / and
teach otherwise / and do defend obstinatly their error / they will not be
satisficed by the word of God / wherefore they are heretics.

They do teach furthermore / that it is lawful in the congregation to do the
holy service / in a tongue that is not vndersto^ded. And this they do indeed /
and defend their misdoinge / neither being admonished will they amend it.
Paul does forbid the (...) Cor. ^4.
christians the use of those tongues in the congregacions / which even by
miracle were bestowed upon them / except they did interpretate and expou^de
that which they should speak in them. And all Paul's reasons are grounded upon
the edifying of the congregation / which above all things we ought to seek
in the holy meetinges and co^gregacions. But there shall be no edificacion at all
/ when that thing which is spoken / is not vnderstonded of the people. Paul
says. My brethren if I do come unto you speaking with tongues / what shall I
profit you / except I speak to you / either by reuelacio^ / or by knowledge
/ or by prophesying / or by doctrine. But these sacrificers / like men that can
do mutch more then Paul / they do come with a strange tongue / which the
congregation understands not / and yet nevertheless they brag that they do
much profit the congregation. Paul will rather speak five words / to the
enformacion of others / then ten thousand words with tongues: Our sacrificers
clean contrary / will rather speak a thousand / yea an infinite number of
words in a strange tongue / then a very feawe / the meaning of which may be
vnderstonded. Paul proves his sentence and mind / even by things that have
no life / as by a trompe / and harp / and les we should be one to an other as
barbarus / and aliauntes / but this is of no force / nor authority with the
papists. For our purpose we have the example of Godd himself / which did
speak unto the Iuishe people in their natural tongue. The greek church did
receive the doctrine of the gospel of the Apostles (which were Hebrews) in
their natural greek tongue. And as from the beginning the Hebrews in their
congregacions have used their natural He brue tongue / so have the Grecians
their greek tongue / and so at the beginning the latin church used their
natural latin tongue also: Only these heretics (the papists I mean) are
delighted with a In novel. Constitu.
strange tongue. Iustiniane the Emprour determines / that all things should
be spoken openly and plainlye in the Temples / that they might both be
heard and vnderstonded / But this the papists regard not. Wherefore seeing they
ca^ not / nor will not / be moved from this their opinion / which is so
absurd and repugnant to the holy scriptures / to the order of the catholic
church / to the laws of the Emproure / without all doubt they are heretics.

They do teach that the sacrament of the Lords body and bludd / should be
ministered in one kind only / when it is given to the people. It is most
manifest and plain / that Christ our Savior did otherwise institute it /
even to be mynistred in both kinds to all communicauntes. These sacrificers
therefore in taking away of the cupp from the people they do committ most
shameful sacrilege. We bring in against them the Institucion of Christ: But
that can they not abide to hear of. Yeat les they should seame to say nothing
/ They say / That the Lord did deliver it in both kinds unto prestes only /
that is to his Apostles. And yet when they themselves do mynister it unto
prestes which do not say Mass / they do give but the one kind only. But
they have nothing to answer unto Paul (who writing to the hole church of
the Corinthians / which were not (...). Cor. 11.
prestes only (as the papists call them) but a congregation both of men and
women) does deliver the holy supper unto them in both kinds / as he received
it of the Lord / here have they nothing to say. And unto this madness some of
these massers do come at lenghth / That they say that the holy communion is
not to be called the Lords supper / for where is it (say they) called the
supper of the Lord? Forsothe Dotor Weston.
Paul / the scoler of the holy ghost / calls it so. 1. Cor. 11. Yea they
ask farther / where the scripture teaches / that this holy sacrament should
be given unto women / as though they would be counted of favor and of their
liberality / to give a communion Lyberall (...) Vvome^
unto women / and not because Godd in his word has appointed the sacrament of
his body and blud 1. Cor. 11.
to be delivered unto women as well as to men. In the holy scripture it is
written / Let a man prove him self. In this word man is man and woman
comprehended. No says a Doctor the greek word is / (...) which signifies the
mankind only: This Master Latymers answer therefore is true. 1. Cor. 10.
Doctor lies lowdly / for the greek word / in that place is / (...) which
signifies both man and woman. The scriptures also do teach / that the holy
communion does partayne unto all them / which are one bread / and one cupp:
wherefore except they will exclude women out of the body of Christ / and show
that they be not of the church of Christ / how shall / or can this papist /
depryue them of the holy commu nion? Especially saying it is plainly taught /
that in Christ there is neither man / nor woman / neither bond / nor fre /
but all are one in Christ. But to return Gal. 3.
to their sacrilege / in which they do take away one part of the sacrament.
Of this theft the institution of the Lord / the Epistle of Paul / the
custom and manier of the primative church / which was to mynister this holy
supper in both kinds / does accuse them / which did continue even until the
time of Thomas Aquinas / and unto this day it continues in all the East
church / wherefore seeing that in this thing also they are so obstinate / they
can be none otherwise esteemed but as heretykes.

They have also another most pernicious and hurtefull doctrine / of the calling
upon the dead saints / and worship / and adoration / to be given to their
Images. The holy scripture says / Thou shall Deuteronomy. 6.
worshipp the Lord thy God / and him only shalt thou serve. But they deny
that they do worship the Images: They may deny it in words / but in their
deeds they do testify clean contrary. They fall down before them / they
pray to them / they cry and call on them / they cense them / they light up
ca^dels before them / what do they more to God him self? They leave no
peculiar thing unto Christ / to ask of him / which they do not ask of some
saint / They do give titles / and names unto the saints / especially to
the blessed virgin Marie / which do belong unto Christ alone. Thou queen
(say they) of mercy / our advocate / our life / our sweetness / and our hope.
Certaynlie these things do belong to Christ only / unto him therefore alone
should they leave these things untouched / and withowt diminutio^. I speak
not this / as though I did not think / that the most holy virgin were worthy
of singular praises / but even she her self will not be made equal with
Christ. They do furthermore cry out of all corners at all their altars unto
their saints / as though they were present every where. But this presence
belongithe to god only / neither is it communicated to any creature. Again it
is written in the Acto. 4.
holy scripture: That there is none other name under heaven / but the name of
Christ only / wherein we 1. Joan. 2.
must be saved. And John does say: If we sin / we have an advocate with the
father / Jesus Christ the rightuous / and he is the propiciation for our
sins. But these heretics make many advocates. Esaie confessith and says.
Abraham has not Esa. 63.
known us / And Israel has forgotten us. And therefore (says he) these are
not to be called upon / we must not trust in them / but in God only / and
that unto him we must fly. We are commanded also in most plain words /
that what so ever we ask / we should ask it in the name of Jesus Christ /
and Joan. 16.
not in the name of other saints / as these men do. But contrary to this
true doctrine they do stifflie maynteyne their wicked error / therefore are they
verylye heretics. Here I do let pass their mass / in whi^ they make their
misshapen Godd of bread / through their art of transubstantiation. They set
up their sacrifice for the quick and dead / the very abomination and God
Maozim: which things they do defend with most perverse obstinacy. But how
contrary they are to the word of Godd is not now again to be repeted /
saying that a little before / in this matter I have said sufficie^tlie. But if
I would spe^de more time here / I might reherce many other doctrines of the
papists in which they do sha^fully swerve from the truithe of Godds word. And
of their errors they will not chau^g any thing at all which prouith them to be
obstinate heretics. But this that I have writo^ is enough / and enough again
to prove that they are heritikes. Now let the^ say that we dissent but in
ceremonies. But I say that we disse^t in doctrines. Let the papists say that
we should not have departed from the^ / but I say / they should not then have
departed from the truithe. Augustine would not grant unto Cresconius / that
the Aduersus Crescon. lib. 2.
controversy between the Catholics and the donatistes / was a light and
small contention / and schism: But he says that they defended an heresy /
and that most horrible / even this that they did rebaptize. And yet baptism
reiterated does no more differ from the word of God / then these errors of
the pa pistes / which I have repeted.

Wherefore Christian princes / whilst they do suffer them in their dominions /
they owghte no otherwise to suffer them / then upon such condicyons as are
above rehearsed. That is / that they do compel no man to partake their wicked
Idolatries. That they do not permit them to have their rites and supersticious
ceremonies. That they take heed / that they do not corrupt others which do
beleaue truly / and be of good iudgeme^te. And last of al / after that they
have been co^petentlie taught / to enforce them outwardly to embrace sownde /
and holy rites / and ceremonies agreinge with Godds word. Thou will say
happily / if it should be so / their condition should be more miserable then
the condition of the Jews / and Turckes / whom we do not compel to receive
our Religion. I grant / but yet this should be justly done. And that for
these causes. First because the Jews are not Citizens in our common welthes /
but received under this condition / that it is lawful for them to use their
own laws / so long as they will: wherefore if they do not behave themselves
well / or they do not please us / they be turned away and cast owte / as
often times they have been handeled. And not without just cause / when their
conversation has been hurtful. But these papists are our citizens /
therefore they must be otherwise handeled / and saying they do confess Christ
/ they are to be enforced to his pure and true religion. Again the Iues can not
do so much hurt as these Iebuzites may / for all men / for themoste part /
do shonne and deteste the Iue / but these are subtle sorcerers / which under
the cloak of the name of Christ / and civil familiarity / may deceive many:
furthermore there is a promise of the salvation of the Iues / to be showed i^
the latter age / The like peculiar promise of papists there is not. And yet I
do not speak this / as though I did condemn the counsel of many good princes
/ which have cast the Iues out of their country / for good just and laufull
causes. Their act I do allow. But to return unto these heretics the
papists / we are bound to pray for them / and saying they do dwell among us
/ we mu ste observe the aforenamed rules / In vsinge or not vsinge familiarity
/ and being conuersaunte with the^ / which I did give / of being conuersaunt
with the unfaithful and wicked / in which sort I do place them. And if any of
them do return to the truith / and will embrace the true Religion of Christ /
they are not to rebaptized. For though a Christian ought not to demand
baptism in the popish church / yet the baptism which they have hitherto
used we acknowledge it to be such that it is not to be reiterated of them who^
they do baptize. Augustine writing Co^tra donat. lib. 5. cap. 23.
of baptism / against the donatistes / says that when they return / the
hands only are to be laid on them: and that les it should apeare / that they
were before without fault. Also that the holy ghost may by prayer be begged
to come upon them / whose singular gift the unity of the true church is.
This ceremony truly is laudable / but yet saying it is not appointed to this
purpose in the holy scripture / it may be omitted: because we do se that the
chiefest use of it (as the apostles used it) was in the institution of the
ministers of the church. Such of them as have been by shopps / and elders /
may be received / into their degrees / and offices / if they do retur ne unto
the truithe: but this must be done / so as shall seem most profitable to the
flock / and church of the lord. If they have such gifts as may serve for
the edyfying of the church / And if by their ministry / the truithe of the
gospel and the salvation of the people which was committed unto them may be
promoted more then by the ministry of other / and aptelie / and as
profitabli, They may be restored to their place / and degree. The order of
which matter is left unto the judgment of the church of God. But if they
remain obstinate in their evil / and do continue peruerters of the godly
doings of the magistrates / and pestilent corruptors of the people: Then the
magistrates may / and owghte to use the sword against the^: for hebearith
the sword to take vengeance on them that do evil / and thereto is he the
minister of God.

A Sermon of the true confessinge of Christ / and the truithe of the gospel:
and of the foul denyinge of the same / made in the conuocacion of the clergy
at Zurich the 28. day of January in the year of the lord 1555.
By. H. B.
Our lord Jesus Christ has forsayed that there should be persequutions / and
chiefly in the later times / through which sum should be despoiled of their
goods / sum also thrown out of their dwellinges / and other should be shut up
in prison / again that other should be fried in the fire and put to other
punishments / and executed with infamus deaths / And that for the lord
Christ himself / and for the doctrine / and confession of the truith of the
gospel. The same lord did then also forsaye / that not a few should fall from
the truithe known. All which things truly we have herd and seen fulfilled /
not in this time only / but in times long passed. For there are sum which at
this day do openly / and that without shame / curs and bydd adieu to the truith
of the gospel / which with demas do embrace this present world. There are
other / and not afew / which do themselves also deny the truith known / and
yet will they not be accounted to be forsakers of it. Thy do stayne themselves
with diverse glosses and colors that they might not be known of the godly and
more simple sort of men. One faynith that he does not go out of Egypt and
Babylon / because he may win many unto Christ: when as in the mean time he
does both withdraw himself from Christ / and does confirm many that be
weaker men in the filthes of babylon so, that they do not at any time think
ernestly of true repentance. Other do fantisie that there is no neade openly to
co^fes religion / but that the inward belief of the heart does suffice: And if
it be of vrge^t necessite to confess any thing openly / yet that the confession
sufficith which is made among the brithern which are well known and companions
in Religion: Neither that the confession among the aduersaires is straightly
required / which shall put them in danger of life. And therefore thou shall
find sum men of exercise which ca^ conningly dispute of papisticall ceremonies
and make meruailus interpretacions of them / laboring by all means to prove
that the godly by the partaking of them neither are defiled / nor yet that the
religion of the gospel is denied. Thus wittye and subtle does that trembling
fear / and great desire of this world make them. Truly when the time served
that they might live without danger in rest and quiet at ease / they then would
never have thought / no not so mutch as dreamed any of this matier / Yea of
these things they would have be^loth but eue^ to have spo ke^ / as things
plain contrary to simplicite / and true religion. But now when the lord has
sent among them the fire of persequution or rather of probatio^ / and they do
se that either they must fly out of their country / or that they must put
there life in extreme ieoperdie / and yet have no will to leave either ease or
their riches / or to committ themselves to dangers / they turn themselves into
all forms / and craftyly creping back by clokinge and dissemblinge they do
seek ways / by which they may slypp away out of the conflict. Which when it
happenith as they would have it / the^ without all doubt / there lives / their
substance / and good estimacio^ do utterly perish. For this cause I think
that I can not entreat a more profitable matter and more meet and necessary
for this our world / then of the true confessing of Christ The argu meant and
matier.
and the truithe of the gospel / and of the foul denyinge of the same. This
matier truly is copius / and most a^ple / wherthrough I doubt nothing at all
but sum of you be all ready made afraid with the largenes of it / which do
consider the end of the sermon by the beginning / and of the matter it self: But
I will at this present touch but certain points of this matier having
co^sideracio^ of the time / and especially of you / reverend fathers and
beloved brethern in in Christ. The lord give me grace omitting things not
necessary / to prosequnte only all those things which be necessary. Those
shameless men / which affirm (without doubt against their own conscience) The
cloak of them that deny true religion.
that there is no neade at all of the outward and dau^gerus confession among the
adversaries of the religion of the gospel / they do wrast the ordinances of
Godd to make a cloak for their malice. And they say / that Godd will not have
holy marriages broken / or that the honor due unto parents should be undone /
that Godd will not have the government of polities or how sholds disturbed /
and to be short that he will not have a man's death and destruction. For what
encreace shall happen to the glory of God by the unrecoverable misery of me
and my household? what profyt should come of my chains / or of my poverty unto
my neighburr? And who is it that knowith not that all things which we do are
to be referred to the glory of Godd / and to the profit of our neighburr? Yea
and if I be burned / or cast into exile for the confession of the gospel / do
I not take miself away from mine by death / before my time? Do I not throw
all mine with me in to extreme poverty and beggerie? And the^ after all my
goods be lost I am compelled to be burdenus unto others. The towardlynes of
my Sons shall be brought in danger. The chastity of my wife and daughters
shall be brought into hazard. For they being pressed with most hard necessity
shall learn by evil arts to get necessaries for their life. And who will
thi^cke that Godd does allow these things? who does so mutche commend the
faith of marriage / the godly bringing up of children / and an howshold well
ordered / that Paul his apostle fearith not to say, That if any provide nor
for his and especially for them of 1. Timo. 5.
his household / the same has denied the faith / and is worse then an
infidel. Wherefore les I should be constrained to confession / and so deny the
faith / I retain faith in my heart / and by holding my peace I do dissemble
for a time / I do nor utterly deny nor throw away all Religion. All these
things (I say) they do most wickedly wraste against their natural and godly
sense / to defend their desires / and to retain their wordly commodities.

But against all these we do set the sentence of our lord and Savior Jesus
Christ / which is neither Confession is necessary
darcke nor doutfull / that by it all the subtilties of these men may at ones
be confuted / and vanishe away. In the gospel of Mathewe he confirming the
mynds of his disciples against the thretts and terrors of this wicked world /
among other things / Are not (says he) two little sparowes sold for a Matthew.

farthinge. And one of them shall not light on the grownd with out your
father: yea even all the hears of your head are nombred. fear ye not
therefore: ye are of more value then many sparowes. Every one therefore that shall
knowledge me before men him will I knowledge also before my father which is in
heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men / him will I also deny before
my father which is in heaven; the same lord in the gospel of Marcke /
Whosoever (says he) shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel ^He same
shall save it. Mare. 8.
For what shall it profit a man / if he win all the world and lose his own
soul? or what shall a man give to redeem his soul wythall again? Whosoever
therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words / in this aduowtrus and sinful
generation: of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he commith in
the glory of his father with the holy angels. These words of the lord are
plain / and spoken without any darcknes. The lord requirith of eiche one of us
that simple and open confession which we make before men / and that such men as
are synnars and adulterars / the enemies / I say / of Godd / and of all true
religion. for such men do the prophets also call fornicatours and adulterars.
He requirith / I say / that we should co^fes him and his word / That is / that
we should simply co^fes that he is Christ / and that we should not deny any
thing of his word either Examples of true confession. Mat. 16.
by our words or deeds. We read that Peter did confess Christ the lord
sincerely and with a true confession when he answered unto the lord / which
asked and said. But who^ say ye that I am / he answered. Thou art Christ the
son of the lyuinge Godd. Again when many did fall from the lord for that
sermon in which he declared in the Synagoge Joan. 6.
of the Capernaites / that he only was the foade of life / and for that cause
the lord said to his disciples: Will ye also go away? Peter answered / and
confessing the lord with a notable confession he said / lord to whom shall we
go? Thou have the words of eternal life / And we believe and are sure / that
thou art Christ the son of the lyuinge Godd. Such like confession absolute
and true does the blessed apostle and Evangelist John comme^d unto us saying.
Dearly beloved / believe not every sprit / but 1. Joan. 4.
prove the sprites / whether they are of Godd or not. For many false prophets
are gone out into the world. Hereby shall ye know the spirit of Godd: Every
sprite that confessith that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh / is of Godd.
And every sprite which confessith not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
is not of Godd. And this is that spirit of Antichriste / of whom ye have herd
/ how that he should comme and even now alreadi is he in the world. Furthermor
this true and catholic confession / does so attribute all our whole life and
salvation unto the lord Christ / that it does take the same from al other
means and things with which ma^s doctrine has any part: wherefore it is not
sufficient only to have confirmed the part affirmative (as they call it) except
thou do also expres the negative / and do so ascribe unto Christ our lord
all the things of our life and salvation / that all men may understood that
thou do claim to him all the parts of our salvation / and that thou do not
give any part thereof to any other. For we do find that the lord Jesus did
teach such a confession / and that his apostles made the like. For when the
lord in the gospel of John speaki^g plainly enough hadd said. I am the door
/ by me if any man enter in / he shall be safe and shall go in and Joan. 10.
out / and find pasture. A thief co^mith not but for to steal / kill / and
to destroy: I am come that they might have life / and that they might have it
more abu^dantly: I am the good shepeherd / a good shepeherd gives his life
for the sheep. Yet was he not content with these though they be most plain
words / but he joined also a Negative / with a most pitthie asseueracio^ /
sayi^g: Verily verily I say unto you he that enterith not in by the door into
the shepefolde / but clymbeth up some other way / the same is a theife and a
murderer. He likewise says plainly in the same chapter / A good shepeherd
goes before his sheep / and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.
Yea forthewith he addith this also / A stranger will they not follow / but will
fly from him / for they know not the voice of stran^gers. Again in an other
place / I am the way (says he) the truithe and the life: Yet he not being
Joan. 14.
content with this so plain a doctrine does add again the exclusyue and
says / No man commith to the father but by me. Wherefore Peter thought it not
inoughe that he said in that full senate of Jerusalem / That Christ is that
Rock which does by his death and resurrection establishe and preserve the
beleauers / onles moreover he hadd Vindicated to Act. 4.
Christ alone all things that concern salvation / and taken the same away
from others / saying. Neither is there salvation in any other: For among men
under heaven there is given none other name wherein we must be saved. After which
manier likewise saint Paul does prove that faith in Christ through grace Roma.
3. Ephe. 2.
does justify / neither does he say this only / but he does also remove all
that which might seem to give justice unto men / the law I mean and worckes
/ saying. We know that a man is not justified by the deeds of the law / but
by the faith of Jesus Gala. 2.
Christ. And we have believed on Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the
faith of Christ / and not by the deeds of the law / because that by the
deeds of the law no flesh shall be justified. And in an other place the same
Paul: Behold (says he) I Paul say unto you / that if ye be circumcised /
Christ Gala. 5.
shall profit you nothing at all. I testify again to every man which is
circumcised / that he is bownd to keape the whole law. Christ is become but
in vayn to you / as many of you as are justified by the law are fallen from
grace / we look for and hope in the spirit to be justified through faith.
These clear examples of Christ and the apostles / and doctrine of the sincere
and sound confession of Christ do suffice to you reverend and godly hearers.
Out of which we do gather / that their co^fessions are neither full / nor
sincere / which do confess that indeed Christ is their salvation and
rightuisnes / their priest and sacrifice / their advocate and mediator / yet so
Impersaite confessio^s.
that it notwithsto^ding they do give the very same / and communicate them to
synneful men / to things also and means which are in no place instituted nor
approved of Godd. And no les corrupt is their confession also / which do confess
with the mouth that Godd alone is to be adored and worshipped / that Christ
is the only preiste and true advocate with the father / but yet in their deeds
they do deny that same confession of their mouth / bowinge their knees to
Images / worshippinge creatures / calling upon their patrons and feigned
saints of The hole doctrine of Christ is to be confessed.
heaven. But the Apostles did not only confess Christ himself / but also all
Christ's doctrine / all Christ's words / the whole gospel (I say) of
salvation: of which Christ is the only Marcke. And therefore when the preistes
and senators of Jerusalem did forbidd the apostles that they should no more
preach the gospel / they ^ered heartily and plainly: whether it be right in
the sight of Godd to harken unto you more the^ unto Godd / iudgeye. For we can
not but speak that which we have seen and herd. And Act. 4.
when they were shutt up in prison for free preching of the gospel / and werin
dan^ger of their lives / they are delivered of the angel / of who^ by the
commandment of Godd they do hear. Go and stand and Act. 5.
speak in the temple to the poeple all the words of this life. Therefore all
those things which are contained in the holy gospel / and holy scriptures /
must be confessed of them which are faithful indeed: for all those are the
wordds of Godd / and the wordds of salvation / And all those do sauer of Christ
and do bring unto Christ. In whom only it has pleased God the father that
all fulness should dwell / in who^ Joan. 1. Colos. 1. 2.
(as Paul does witness) we are made perfect so that we want nothing / as again
the lord himself does testify: he that eats or drincketh me shall not be
hungry or thrustie for ever / but he shall have in him Ioa^. 4. 5. 7.
self the healthefull waters of everlasting life. If we do know / beleaue /
and understand these things let us give glory to our only Savior Christ /
and not give it away unto other / But let us freely confess him only / and alone
/ in mouth / and deeds / to be our salvation justice sanctificacion absolution
or rather perfection / the peace of our souls / and life everlasting. But the
lord does set denying against confessinge. There are diverse kinds of denyinge /
which being but lightly rehearsed it shall again appear what is the sowndnes
and simplicity of confessinge. Furst Christ and Godds word is denied / when
our redeamer Christ / and the word of life is openly blasphemed in plain
words / when he is not acknowledged to be the only Savior / and when the due
dignity and authority of the scriptures is not adscribed unto them. Then by
silence also is Christ and Christ's word denied / namely when upon occasion
offered we do not deffende the glory of the name of Godd and of the truythe
known against the ennemis of Godd and sclaunderers of the word of Godd. For
in this case it is lawful for no man to be a / neuter / as they call it. In A.
Neuter.
the most ancient laws of Solon which were at Athens graven in posts of
wood / the which also ons made by him the Athenienses ordeygned under great
religion and punishment that they should continue for ever: one law Aristotle
does report to be writon in this sense. That if through discord the poeple
should be divided into too parts / and eich party should take armor / then he
which did not join himself to the one party / but slipp aside separated from
the common evil of the city / he shall lose house / countrithe / and goods /
and be an exile and a banished man. Mutch les is it lawful for them which have
professed the name of Christ / and are signed with holy baptism / in that
fierce fight between Christ and Antichriste to slip a side / and to join
himself unto neither party. That same newtralitie does seame truly to be
wisoo^ to many children of this world / but indeed it is folyshnes / yea it
is a very denying of Christ / by which they do exclude themselves out of that
heavenly coun trithe / they spoil themselves of all spiritual riches / and
make themselves exiles and banished men. For Christ and his truithe is denied
either by dissemblinge: Math. 26.
as when Peter was charged by the maid that he was one of the number of the
disciples / and he answered I wot not what thou say. He knew verily what
she said / but being bewitched with a certain fear / he feigned that he knew
not the thing which he did know very well. Even so truly at this day many do
say that they are more simple then that they can understand the dissension in
religion and give answer of all controversies: But they do understand so mutch
as sufficith: yet for the ieoperdies which be at hand / or for sum vain fear
/ they do feign that they do not understand. Neither were it necessary for
every one to answer to all darcke or hard things / which thing they which are
well exercised can not do / it sufficith to confess those things which be open
and plain. There is also a colored denyinge when we playyng the foxes with
foxes do cofes verily sumwhat of our religion / yetwe / do so enwrapp it with
such darcke words and doutfull sentences / that unto the^ which are most
subtle and conning in quidities / it shall not plainly appear what we do
think. But the confession should be simple / and plain. In making of it Godd
/ and not Man were Glory is to be given to Godd.
to be considered. Man may be deceived / but no man ca^deceyne Godd. And also
we are command to render unto God his glory franckly before men. But I do
not see how thou haste glorified Godd before men / when thou do so temper thy
confession that it sumwhat sauerith indeed of the truithe of the gospel / and
yet they which be superstitius shall not see their supersticions utterly
rejected / nor their errors condemned by thy confession / but may judge that
thou do yet hold on their side. Again many do confess Christ in words and
his gospel freely / and openly inoughe / but eue^ they themselves do forthwith
defile and overthrow this Christian and gospellike confession with vngospellike
deeds. I do speak nothing here of those sins and wickednesses by which they
do unhallow the doctrine of our Savior / but of those supersticius ceremonies
and wicked co^gregacions with which they do communicate / by which communion or
partakinge indeed they do deny that which they did co^fes before. For he
which does co^fes by mouth that they which do depart out of this life in true
faithedo not (through the mediacion of Christ) comme into Judgment / but do
strayte way pass from the bodily death unto life everlasting / even as the
doctrine of the gospel does enstruct us / and we do plainly confess in the
articles of the apostles Creed / this namely that we do beleaue the forgyuenes
of sins / the rising again of the flesh / and life everlasting: And yet so
sone as any of their elders or familiars do depart out of this world / they go
strait to sacrificing prestes / and do dema^de of them church assemblees /
supplicacions / dirges / weak minds / tre^talles / to be short / yearemynds /
and prayers and sacrifices expiatorie for the dead / to whom he does join
himself / and does observe those rites / has he not plainly denied in deed
that which he hadd confessed in word? He that does confess that Christ was ons
only offered for the sins of the whole world / and that he is not therefore to
be offerred any moore / And that the holy Supper is a rememberau^ce of this
only and everlasting sacrifice / and not the sacrifice it self / and yet
nevertheless does go unto there gods service / which do stoutly asseuere that
they do offer up Christ in substance for the sins of the living and the
dead: does he not by goi^g to and co^municatinge with this service / deny
that which by speaking and professing he hadd confessed? These truly are ways
of denyinge / which they do not fully understand which are almost persuaded /
the Religion is but a play / and as it were a slipper fit for every foot.
These me^ do know how to rule all religions under a certain color of holy
concord / but indeed for earthly commodity / that among who^ so ever they do
live like unto a Cameleon they do take unto themselves their color and
ceremonies / being mutch more changeable then Protheus / of whom it is but
folly to beleaue / that they do pass for any religion at all. But let us pass
over these unstable cha^gelinges / and establishe our mynds / that they be not
lewse nor waueringe / but being knytte up and confirmed in the lord / they
may have sum surety and stablenes of the sure and stable, word of Godde /
which we may both in mowthe and deeds confess / and in which we may finally
rest. That maruailus and heavenly and therewith tho^deringe prophet Helias /
how long (says he) halte ye between 3. Reg. 18.
two opinions. Ifthe lord be Godd follow him: but if Baal be he / then go
after him. Even so truly our lord himself does say in the ^gospell / that no
man can serve two masters. Let us therefore forsake all other Godds and religions
/ and cleave only to our Godde / which is the father of our lord Jesus Christ
/ and let us stick fast in the only Christen religion / which is delivered
unto us in the holy scriptures. For it is everlasting and most certain. But if
it be sufficient to confess Christ and his gospel It sufficith not to con fes
Christ among the brethern. Mat. 10.
among our felows and brethern in religion / whereto I pray you will these our
men refer those words which do go before this place of confession in the
gospel? Behold I send you forth as sheep among wolves. rc. They shall
deliver you up to the cowncelles and shall scourge you for me. rc. But whe^they
deliver you up take ye no thought how or what ye shall answer: for it shall be
given you / eue^ in that same hour / what ye shall speak. etc. Fear ye not
the^ which kill the body / but are not able to kill the soul. He which does
deny that all these sayings must be understand of persequutors / he says
that darcknes is light. Yea and in Marc he does plainly say. Whosoever
therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this aduoutrus and synefull
Marc. 8.
generation / of him also shall the son of man be ashamed. He requirith
therefore a confession of the truithe not only in the company of the godly / but
also in the company of the ungodly and persequutours / howsoever it be joined
with the ieoperdie of life and of all the substance. The lord speaking in
Apocal. 2.
the book of the reuelacion with the church of pergamos / I know (says he)
where thou dwell / eue^ where Satan's seat is / and thou keapest my name /
and haste not denied my faith: And in those days in which Antipas was a
faithful witness of mine / which was slain among you where Satan dwellithe.
In which words truly the confession made in persequution is allowed / made I
say in that place / where Satan did bear rule / where even very then Antypas
that notable Martyr of Christ was slain for confessinge of religion. Otherwise
when all things are quiet it is not so hard a thing to confess the name of
Godde. For if so be that the lord will not have us be i^ ieoperdie of body
goods and life / if it seem to be evil and a sin for a man / as it were to
procure death to himself by the confessinge of truithe / wherefore does the
lord (I pray you) exhort those his disciples / that they should not fear them
which do kill the body / and can not kill the soul? Whidoth he by plain
words say / as it were provoking us to martyrdom? Whosoever will Marc. 8.
follow me / let him forsake himself / and take up his cross / and follow me.
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it. But whosoever shall lose his
life for my sake / and the gospelles the same shall save it. Be addith
forthwithe words which do make for the contempt of those things / for which
these men do think that in religion silence may be kept and dissimulacion
used / sainge. What shall it profit a man / yfhe win all the world / and
lose his own soul. Therewith also does he add through what thing we do lose
our souls / that is through Shame. For he says. Whosoever therefore shall be
ashamed of me and of my words / in this aduowtrus and synefull generation / of
him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he commithe in the glory of
his father with the holy Angels. Therefore Paul that chosen vesell of Christ
/ and a most faithful teacher of the church / who gives evil council to no
man / neither leadith he any man from the true way / it is (says he) a true
saying: for if we be dead with 2. Tim. 2.
him / we shall also live with him: if we be pacient / we shall also reign with
him. If we deny him / he shall also deny us. The same Paul to the Bebrues /
Call to reme^beraunce (says he) the days that are Heb. 10.
passed / in the which after ye hadd received light / ye endured a great fight
of adversities / partly while all men wondered and ^ased at you for the shame
and tribulacion that was done unto you / partly while ye became companions of
them which so passed their time. For ye became partakers also of the
afflictions which happened through my bonds / and took in worth the spoiling
of your goods / and that with gladness / Knowing in yourselues / how that ye
have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. Cast not away therefore
your confidence / which has a great recompense of reward. For ye have neade
of patience / that after ye have done the will of God / ye might receive the
promise. For yet a very litill while / and he that shall comme / will comme /
and will not tarry. But the just shall live by faith. And if he withdraw
himself my soul shall have no pleasure in him. It is not we that withdraw
ourselves unto damnacio^ / but we partayne unto faith / to the wynning of the
soul. This truly is a sownde and wholesome doctrine / to clean fast unto this
/ is to pleas Godd / and to glorify him / add also to promote the salvation
of the brethern. Therefore whils these men do reply / what The death and
persequution of the sain ctes does glorify Godd.
should come to the encreace of glory of Godd / or what commodity should comme
to Christ of those my labors and dangers which I should sustain for religion?
wittingly and willingly they do disprove the doctrine of the apostle / which
does plainly witness / not in these places only which we have alleged / but in
many others also / that both Godd is glorified by our sufferinges and
calamities which we do sustain for religions sake / and also that the weak
brethern are thereby edified / of whom it is certain that by dissemblinge and
denyinge of Religion they be offended / confirmed in there errors / and indeed
destroyed. For that most excellent prophet David / Right dear (says he) in
the sight of the lord / is the dathe of his saints. Psalm. 116.
And saint Peter says Dearly beloved / maruayle not that ye are proved by
fire / which thing is to 1. Pet. 4.
try you as though sum stran^ge thing happened unto you / but rejoice / in as
mutch as ye are partakers of Christ's passions / that when his glory appearith
/ ye may be merry and gladd. If ye be rayled upon / for the name of Christ /
happy are ye / for the glory and the sprite of Godd restith upon you. On there
part he is evil spoken of / but on your part he is glorified / and so
furthe. And saint Paul does pronounce that it is a most greuus sin if any
man do offend the weak by his evil example. Thy brother does perish (says
he) for whom Christ died. When ye sin so against the brethern / and wound
their weak conscience / ye sin against Christ. Again we are said in the
scriptures to have saved him whom we have by sound doctrine and our good
example / either retained in the way of the lord / or have brought him back
that went astraye. But if a greater regard is to be had of wife / children and
household then of pure religion / so that for that regard / religion seem
either to be dissembled or denied: Yfit be evil for religions sake to dissente
from them that be of kindred and alliance / yea and for religion to depart
from a lawful wife / and in sum / for faith to disagree with all fre^des and
familiars / shall we say that the lord did teach evil / which said in the
gospel? Think not that I am come Mat. 10.
to send peace into the earth. I came not to send peace but a swearde. For I
am come to set a man at variance against his father / and the daughter against
her mother / and the daughter in law against her mother in law. And a man's
foes shall be they that are of his own household. For from hence forth there
shall be five in one house divided / three against two / and two against three. The
father shall be Luc. 12.
divided against the son / and the son against the father. This is not
spoken as though that dissension in it self did pleas Godd the author of all
peace / but because he will have that peace which stondithe upon evil and
wicked things broken / and have us all conjoined in that which is holy and
good. And therefore we do not allow when marriages fre^dshippes and leagues are
broken without necessity / and under an untrue pretense of religion. Again we
do dissalowe those which are kept against the commandment of Godd with plain
hurt of true religion / and open denyinge of the faith. All persons must
bend themselves to peace and concord so far as they may / with retayninge of
sowndnes in religion: But when it can not be retained / let none think that
to keape peace with them (...) he must co^mitt Idolatry. And therefore the
Apostle of Christ says: If any brother have a wife / which beleauith 1. Cor.
7.
not / if she be content to dwell with him / let him not putt her away. rc.
But if the vnbeleauinge do depart let him depart. A brother or a Sister is not
in subjection to such. But Godd has called us in peace. Even so truly it is
an unnatural thing not to norishe the children / or to neglect the aged
pare^tes / or to forsake friends and familiars. Godds word does every wheare
commau^de that we should do reverence and duty to them to whom by the law of
Godd / and man / we owe it. In which sense we do willingly admit that saying
of the Apostle. That he which does not provide for them which be of his
howshold / both denies the faith / and is wors the^ an infidele. We do
acknowledge that they are deuels and not men whosoever they be / which do
wickedly disturb well ordered policies / and howsholdes. But yet in all these
we do also acknowledge this / and we se it taught in the whole scripture as
for an undoubted truithe / that the lord Godd is better the^ all these / that
the covenant and bond of religion does excede all other bonds in the world.
And that the lord does both so will and command / that we should esteame him
above all things / and love him above al things / and that when he speakith
we all should hold our peace / that there we should not think at all of
colored expositions and excuses / but only of simple and plain obedience /
such / as we read that Abraham showed unto Godd / who^ Godd commanding him /
did go out of his country into Genesis 12. Heb. 11. Genesis 22. Heb. 11. Luc. 14.
a strange land / and when he did not refuse to sacrifice unto the lord his
only Son / without suspicion of cruelty. Truly in the holy gospel the lord
does say. If a man come to me / and hate not his father / and mother / and
wife / and children / and brethern / and systers / yea and his own life also /
he can not be my disciple. And whosoever does not bear his cross and comme
after me / can not be my disciple. They truly which have been content to bear
this ioke of the lords / have neither lost themselves / yea though they have
been slain of persequutours / nor yet their family / which they did leave in
trobles and penury of things. For by teachinge of experience and witnessing
of histories / we have learned / that Godd by such miracles as have been done
at the graves of martirs has witnessed / that they which were killed / were not
lost but saved / that they were not dead but living. Furthermore we ca^ not
say nay but that Godd has blessed the families of such slain martirs / and
that he has moved the hearts of good men which have received those abiects and
miserable persons into their custody / so that they wanted nothing. Besides
this the godly do know that in this world they must honger / and that they
must be exercised with diverse adversities / that they may be made like unto the
image of Christ who was himself in all points tempted for us / like Heb. 4.
as we are / but yet without sin. But now this remaynith as yet to be
discussed / which these men do take as for an oracle / and most evident
truithe. That Weather it sufficith to keep faith in the heart, and not confess
it with mouth.
it is sufficient if a man do keape the true faith in his heart / and that
there is no farther neade of outward confession / through which thou should be
drowned in the deape of afflictions. If it does suffice to beleaue in heart /
and the confession with the mowthe seem not necessary / wherefore I pray you
Has the lord said? Every one which confessithe me before Men. rc. Behold he
says before Men. But faith which stickith still in the heart is not brought
forth before men. Yea it is not to be called a confession / when faith does
lurcke in the heart. For Confession does properly bring forth that which did
lie hidden within. The Apostle therefore taking from us all doubt in this
controversy. The word (says he) Romans ^0.
is nyghe the / even in thy mouth / and in thy heart. This same is the word
of faith / which we preach. For if thou knowledge with thy mouth that Jesus
is the lord / and beleaue in thy heart that God raised him up from death
thou shall be safe. For to beleaue with the heart justifies / and to knowledge
with the mowthe makes a man safe. what can thou desire to be more plainly
and evidently spoken in this matier? Thou do clearly hear that thou take
away salvation if thou do cut of the confession of the mouth from the
belief of the heart. Yea and the belief of the heart is of that nature that it
ca^ not lie hydd / but must of necessite break forth to be confessed with the
mouth. If the confession of the mouth neadith not / neither then shall there
neade any preachinge of the truithe. But the Apostles / bushopps and faithful
martirs of Christ / when they preached even among the wicked / have most
bitterly condemned Idolatry / and all doctrine and worshipp which does not
agree with the holy gospel / and affirmed that the gospel only does teach
the true worshipp of Godd. By that confession of mouth they did glorify Godd
/ they did disanull Iudaisme and paganism / and did erecte many holy
congregacions through the world / which by holdinge their peace and keapinge
the true faith within their heart they should never have edified. Whereof every
man seith that the confession of the mouth is always necessary / and that
it is required of every one of us. The notable examples also of the excellent
servants of Godd contained in the scriptures do teach the same. That same
great prophet of Godd Helias was ones of that mind that he only of all the true
worshippers (...). Reg. 19.
of Godd was left alive upon the earth. But he hearith eue^ of the lord
himself / which says / I have left me seven thousand in Israel / of which
never man bowed his knee unto Baal nor Kyssed him with his mouth. Here is
nothing spoken of the secret faith of the heart / but of the outward fruits
of true faith. For these were outward things / to bow the knees unto Baal /
and to kiss his Image with their mouth. It is said that they did not these
things / and therefore are they taken for true and very worshippers of Godd.
The lord / if he hadd thought that which these our men do think / he might
have made mention of the faith of the heart without the outward confession /
especially seeing those times were so daungerus that Helias himself did fly into
the wilderness. But the lord does praise in his faithful the outward
confession / which was made in work / rather the^ in words. Wherefore we must
show forth the faith of the heart both by deeds and words / after the
exeample of these seven thowsande confessors whom God does praise. We must not
goo unto unholy assemblees / we must not bow our knees nor uncover our heads
before Idols / we must not kiss those things / which are contrary to the
gospel.

If any other in the whole world / those three princes Dan. 3.
(of whom mention is made in Daniell) might have colored there Idolatry / but
they chose rather to submitt themselves to cruel punishment / then to bow
their knee before that Image which the king did set up to be worshipped.
These men of ours would have said. It shall be better to keep faith in the heart
for the profitinge of many / then rashly to poor it furthe to the hurt of an
infinite number. For so long as we are safe / the miserable captives shall
receive great and many benefits: Yea and also we privily may promote the
truithe in the princes court. But by this same vnceasonable confession /
confusion of all things shall even at ons ouerwhelme all these things. And
with out doubt they would have added that the Image which the king hadd set up
was not altogether to be deputed among profane things / forbicause that the
true God hadd showed the king a vision or an Image / which did conteyn great
mysteries of the kingdom of Godd / after the form of which Image /
Nabugodonozor hadd caus^ this Image to be made and graued / which Image the
faithful for that cause might behold and reverence as the work of Godd. But
those valiant / and glorius Martirs do make mencio^ of no such thing / and
though they did know the kings mind Dan. 3.
well enough in this matier / yet they do plainly say to the king. Be this
known unto the (o king) that we will not serve thy gods / nor do reverence
unto that Image which thou have set up. Neither did they only use this
liberty of speech before the king / but willingly they offered there bodies to
all dangers / yea eue^ to most fearful fires. Daniel also did not thick that
Godd was religiusly enough worshipped (...) Dan. 6.
and served with the inward faith of the heart / except he had added the
outward confession also. For when those hethen princes did lay snares for him /
of which he was not ignorant / and therefore might peaceably have prayed to the
lord within his walls at home / yet would he not dissemble in this matier. For
what does the scripture say? This / that when Daniel perceived what the king
hadd commanded / he went into his house / and the windows of his wall
toward Jerusalem stood open. There kneled he down upon his knees three times
a day / he made his petition and praised his Godd / and so opened he his
confession to Godd. This same most holy prophet of Godd might seem to be
beside himself thus willingly to procure evil to himself / and as it were
without neade to provoke the enemies of Religion against him: but the scripture
does not settfurth unto us any error / no vnco^sideratnes or rash boldness in
this matier / but does teach us plainly to yield unto Godd confession in
deeds and in words. Unto these examples of the holy scripture we will now
add other things which do agree with them (for those things which do disagre
from the scriptures we pass litill or nothing at all / what authority so ever
they have among me^) This we will do out of the Ecclesiastical history.
Ecclesiast. hist. lib. 6. cap. 28.
Eusebius entreating of such things as Origin did / makith mention that Origin
did mightily oppugn a new heresy which did spring up in his time / it was
called the heresy of Helchesaites / and at le^ghth he did happily extinguishe
it. He shewith that they among many other things did hold this heresy / that
if a man did deny in persequut^ (...) sinned not at all / forbicause that he
which is stable and confirmed in his heart / although he does deny with the
mouth for necessity / yet as touching the heart he abidith in faith. By
which words truly every man may perceive that the same pestilent error is
brought again as it were out of hell / in our age / and se that he ought chiefly
to beware of it as of an heresy condemned. The same Eusebius in the viij.
book does set forth notable examples of many martirs of Christ which did
freely confess the truith / out of whom I will recite unto your godlynes these
few things / which without doubt will be acceptable unto all. They whose mind
(says he) was more ready and their faith more strong / suffered torments.
Sum were beaten with whippes / other were tormented with iro^ houes / sum other
were burned with fierye plates / of who^ many indeed being weried did give
over. But other did abide patiently even to the end. Sum of the persequutours
them selves verily / as though they hadd used pity / did bring many of our
me^ to the wicked sacrifices / and made a noise as though they hadd sacrificed
/ when indeed they hadd not sacrificed. Of sum other when they hadd not so
mutch as come nighe the unclean sacrifices / they did cry out / that they had
already sacrificed and did now depart. Which were only faulty (I pray you
marcke these words) in this / that they did with silence bear the fault
which was objected against them. Sum being taken up half alive were thrown
away as though they hadd been dead. Sum being drawn out by the feate /
were accounted among them which hadd sacrificed. Sum cried out against the
persequutors and denied with a mighty voice that they hadd sacrificed. Other
cried out that they were Christians / and did glory in the confessinge of that
healthful name. Many also with a greater confidence did testify that they
neither hadd / neither would sacrifice ever. Whose mouths and eyes the
torme^tours did forthewith beat / to cause them to hold there peace / and they
were with violence thrust forth as though they hadd done the thing. For so the
enemies of godlynes did mutch esteame it / if atleast wise they did but seem
to bring to pas that which they would. Many other things like unto this /
might I add / partly out of the Tripartita historia / partly out of Eutropius.
But these are sufficient: And these do plainly and evidently enough prove /
that the lord does require of true Christians / a true and plain confession of
the mouth / yea even in the gretest dangers and furies of the persequutors /
and therefore that these tenderlinges do most manifestly err / which do think
otherwise / only to save their filthy paunche.

It remaynith now right Reverend fathers / and most dear brethern in Christ
that I should briefly Of ceremo nies.
touch also these men's reasoninges of popish Ceremonies / which I said at the
beginning they do wittyly handle to persuade themselves / and others / that no
man by the partakinge of them does either defile himself / or by it deny the
religion of the gospel. And surly it is well known that the name of Ceremonies
not being narowly weyed / has bewitched the eyes of many / not only in this
but in other controversies of religion. It is therefore to be known that
Ceremonies are nothing else but holy rites. And of Ceremonies sum are called
divine which are instituted (I say) of Godd himself / sum other are called
humayne / such as are invented by ma^s will. But of the dyuine or ceremonies of
God / sum belonged Divine ceremonies.
to the old poeple / of which the writings of the prophets and apostles do
bear witness that they were abrogate in Christ. Sum do belong to the new
poeple that is to Christians / which were delivered unto them of Christ by the
Apostles / and those truly very few / as of holy assemblees / of sacraments /
and certain ecclesiastical obseruacio^s / which are declared in the writi^ges
of the Apostles. Of ceremonies enuented by man there is (...) almost Human

neither measure nor end. For they were enue^ted and established at diverse
times / and that by diverse and sundry autors / and they were so delivered and
instituted of them / that they do not only not consent with the holy scriptures
but they be contrary to the^ / insomutch that they do deface and corrupt the
ordinances which Godd has instituted / and do put them out of place. Of this
kind is that church deckinge and dressinge / in which Images have the chief
place. Of the same sort also is Massinge / strange apparel / synging / and
feasts appointed to saints which be in heaven / and other innumerable of this
sort. All which truly the papists do adorn with the title of ceremonies /
which when the simple and such as have litill knowledge do hear / they do
Imagine sum holy thing as though that all these things were sent down out of
heaven from the lord Godd himself to be kept. But here we do admonish men
that they must stey sumwhat / and must sumwhat more diligently make difference
between ceremonies / and must more narowly look / whether that these ceremonies
(of which we do contend) be of Godd or of man. Every man knowith that none is
defiled by such ceremonies as are of Godd. And he which denies that a man is
defiled by humayn ceremonies / he seith nothing at all. For though I do not
again urge that which I said eue^ now / that those humayn ceremonies are
contrary to Gods word / and do defile Godds ordinances / corrupt them and
hyde them / can that be obscure or unknown to any man which our lord Jesus
Christ does plainly with expressed words bring out of Esaye? They do serve
me in vain / teachinge Mat. 15.
the doctrines and precepts of men. Again that which Paul does affirm that
they be commandments Tit. 1.

fury to violate the ordinance of Godd. And for this cause the godly will not
call these ordinances any longer / ceremonies / simply / but rather man's
institutions / and supersticions / which are rejected and forbidden of Godd.
Wherefore howsoever these men do beautifully set forth and adorn these things /
yet shall they never bring this to pass / that the goddly will beleaue that
it is lawful for the^ to communicate with supersticio^s / and such institucions
as are forbidden of God: Neither will the godly beleaue but that these things
are forbidden / except the papists shall prove by plain testimonies of the
scripture that they are so instituted of Godd as they do use them. Which thing
when it can not be proved of them / nor yet at all of any other of the papists
/ sum of our false gospellers do turn the^ selves hither / that they say that
Paul also did use forbidden ceremonies / and that the prophets Paul circu^
cised Timothe^.
of Godd did reprove the sacrifices / which they nevertheless did partake
without sin. And if we do grant the^ this altogether / how can they (I
pray you) help or set forth their cause? We read that Paul used ceremonies
instituted of Godd / circum cision and sacrifices / but these men do contend
for ceremonies instituted by men. Paul did ons circu^cise his Timothy / and
did ons ore twis take on him a vow / and that for certain and weighty causes.
Actu. 16. 18. 21.
But these men covet to wax old in their supersticions / and have no lawful
causes to do so / except thou wilt call that lawful which co^mith of the affe

acts to be set against his whole doctrine. But wh^ do they not rather follow
Paul in that / when he refused to circu^cise Titus? Gal. (...).
seeing like causes are ministered unto them by those which go about to spoil

the^ into bondage. We do say that there were two sorts of the Sacrifices
among the old poeple of Israel. Sum of them are redd to be instituted of Godd /
which the poeple sum time abused / or else did not use them with true faith /
which thing the prophets did reprove / and not the Sacrifices themselves / of
which they did partake religiusly and without sin: Even as we read that
Paul did worthily partake the supper of the lord / although he does reprove
the abuse of the supper in the Corinthians. Other sacrifices there were enuented
by man / such were the sacrifices of Baal / and of Jeroboam / and those which
were done in the hills. These truly the prophets did reprove / but it is not
read that they did communicate with the same. This example therefore is offorce
against them which will excuse themselves by the example of the prophets / in
that they do partake such sacrifices as are instituted of man.

Forthewith the^ they say / what is it to me though papists do abuse the
Mass? In their abuse I do Hovvsum do thinc^e that they may be at Masses, and

call to mind the true use / and I come unto it with an other mind and
understanding then they do say it. For when I see the bread and cupp / I do
not think upon the transubsta^ciation which the pope has feigned / but on
the sacrament of Christ. And therefore when I am at mass I do not regard what
ceremonies be there / ore what the minister is / but I do remember the very
institution of Christ and I do spiritually receive that / which he does say
that he does corporally offer and receive / for the lyuinge and the dead. And
saying I know that the virtue of the sacrament is not of les force for the
varictie of ceremonies / ore the unworthiness of the ministers / I do suppose
that I / which do well use an evil thing / am neither defiled / nor yet that
by this my spiritual communicating I do deny the gospel. By these words a
man would judge these men to be madd / except he do consider that it is not they
which do thus speak / but fear / and desire / which are affections plainly
most trobled. They do simply acknowledge that papists do abuse the supper of
the lord / but yet (they say) that they themselves do well use their abuse /
forbicause they do come enstructed with an other meaning then the papists do
it / not to hear a popish mass which the papists say / but to receive the
supper of the lord / the self same which they in their mass do thi^cke
abominable. I do not know whether there ca^ be any greter ab surditie spoken.
Thou maiste say that these me^ have learned an art which hitherto no man
could attain / to ^bb a naked man of clothes / to wringe water out of a
pumeise stone / and to bid a man to get fish in the air / that is / at a
table where no meat is set forth at all / to fare delicatly and to be filled.
But go to / let them freely profes before them with who^ they do thus
communicate / that they be of that mind which they speak of / that is / that
in cu^minge to Mass they will not come to Mass / but that in it they will
understood and consider bread / yea and that they will set before their
minds the supper of the lord / that they will not co^fes the popish
transubsta^tiatio^ / but that they do here in acknowledge Christ's Sacrament /
and that they do well receive that spiritually in the Mass / which the pressed
does offer / and receive bodily for the living and the dead / which thing he
beleauith not. Will not all they forthewithe cry out / that there holy Mass is
unhallowed / and that they which think so are heretics / and that they which
do communicate with them are excommunicated? Truly they would so behave
themselves / that every man might understand / that there is a great difference
between the Mass and the supper of the lord / and that they do embrace the
Mass / but the supper of the lord they do all ways hate and reject. With such
a kind of me^ yet do these men communicate / which would think it a hurtefull
and damnable thing / if they should admit unto their divine service / the
companions of the religion of the gospel with their faith. For they do take
the approuinge of their doctrine / to be the condemnynge of the religion of the
gospel: And they do take the communion in the Mass to be a certain confession
and approbation of their religion. Who is it then which does not se / that
these me^ do receive no part of the lords supper at all in the mass / but
also that by coming to the mass they do deny the supper of the lord and the
whole faith of the gospel? These men say that they pass nothing what the
ceremonies be / what the ministers / for that the virtue of the Sacrament is
not the wors for the^. But the chief question here is not of the worthiness of
the ceremonies or ministers / but of the true use and institucion of the supper
of the lord / and whither that the Mass as it is at this day used (I do not
now speak any thing at all of that which was used above a thousand years
passed) were so instituted of Christ / and be indeed the very supper of the
lord? If the Mass be that mystical supper of the lord / it must needs be
allowed of the lord / and thou (if so be thou do come to it in faith) can
not but receive thereof the food of life / forsomutch as the vnworthnes of the
mynister does not hinder the. But if the Mass be not the supper of the lord /
if the supper of the lord be defaced, corrupted and ^den under foot by the
Mass / truly thou shall receive no fruit thereof / but shall rather purchase
to thy self great gilte of sin / for that the gaye glos^e of the ceremonies
or any worthiness of the ministers shall not help the at all. Even Jeroboam
himself would have been counted to have sacrificed to the Godd of Israel: but
yet because he did not sacrifice after the same manier which God had commanded
/ but rather after that sort which he himself hadd inverted and instituted /
godd did not accept his sacrifices / and those did sin against godd and
against true religion / yea and against the lawful Sacrifices of godd / as
many as did communicate with the sacrifices of Ieroboa^. For both that Ieroboa^
sinned / and that he did lead Israel to sin / the scripture does repeat
very often / to beat i^ to the head of the whole world / that simple
obedience does pleas the lord / i^ which we (...) his ordinances after that
manier only which he has instituted / adding nothing / dyminishing nothig /
and chau^ging nothing in the^.

I will not now reason how that the Mass does agree nothing at all with the
lords supper / for this is eue^ to the eyes of all men often times showed in
many books of most learned and godly servants of Godd. Yea eue^ children which
are but instructed in the priciples of faith / do know that Christ did
institute a common partaking / ore communion / in which all the faithful which
are one body in Christ are knitt together in to one body / and that the
Mass is a dissipacio^ of unity and a private deuowri^g of one lurching
sacrificer. They know that Christ commanded: Take / eat / divide it among
you / and drink ye all of this. And that the Mass does set forth these
things to be gazed upon / to be worshipped / to be carried about / and to be
shutt up / to be ha^deled and also received of preistes only: They know that
Christ said: Do this in the rememberaunce of me. And that the preistes do say
Mass in the reme^beraunce of saints / that they do sacrifice for the sins
of the quick and the dead / and to be short that they do say mass for every
thing / for filthy lucres sake.

There were in the time of the Apostles certain witty disputars which reasoned
that it was lawful for Christians to eat meats offered unto Idols. Meats
offered to Idols / were sacrifices used in the temples of Idols / to be
offered unto Idols. Therefore those faithful men did contend / that it was lauful
indifferently to communicate with the holy service of the Christians / and also
to sytte down in the Idols feast. They did add plausible expositio^s / that an
I^oll was nothing / because Godd was not represented by the Idol / that there
is but one Godd / the same our true and everlasting Godd: Whereof it followed
that the Idol was nothing / that is to say a thing of no valor or a very
vanity / that it could hurt no body / and that the very meat offered unto
the Idol was a thing of nothing / that it did defile no man. But Paul with
many words does confute that folery. 1. Cor. cap. 8. 9. and 10. In this tenth
chapter among other things he gatherith of the nature of the supper of the
lord that a man may not both be partaker of the supper of the lord and of
the table of Idols / and says: Ye ca^ not drink of the cup of the lord /
and of the cup of devils. Ye can not be partakers of the lords table / and of
the table of deuiles. Either do we provoke the lord? Are we stronger then he?
Also the Apostles of Christ and elders of the church of Jerusalem in that
same great and notable counsel of Jerusalem / which of all that ever were
was most holy and of most authority / did plainly forbidd the Gentiles / which
were converted to Christ / those meats offered to Idols. Yea and the lord
Jesus himself in the book of the Reuelacion does greuusly accuse and condemn
them which do eat meat offered unto Idols. This may ye se in the epistles of
the church of Pergamos and Thiatira. In the furst he says: But I have a few
things against the / because Apocal. 2.
thou have there them that maintain the doctrine of Balaam which taught in
balacke to put occacio^ of sin before the children of Israel / that they
should eat of meats dedicate unto Idols and committ fornication / and so
forth. I think here neadith not many words to show wherefore I have alleged
these sayings of meats offered unto Idols: for all the godly do plainly see
/ that by like reason all divine service that is unholy / or contrary to Godds
word / with what color so ever they be stained / are forbidden and condemned.
They see that all such expositions are put away / by which these fearful
me^ / and such as do love the world and worldly pomp to mutch / do lead
themselves away from the right tracke / that they should not sincerely confess
Christ.

All they which be godly do both see and perceive The Conclusion and
adhortation to fre confession.
that they which do desire to live everlastingly have neade to make a simple
clear and plain confession / they see that Christ's name must be confessed /
and that no man must communicate with Antichriste / how great so ever dangers
do hang over them / and how great so ever the aduan^tages be which are offered
unto them. They see that they must tread down the fear and desire of the
flesh. The most holy Apostle of Christ writith of Moses. By faith Moses when
he was great / refused to be called the son of Pharaos daughter / and chose
rather to Heb. 11.
suffer adversity with the people of Godd / then to enjoy the pleasures of
sin for a ceason / and esteamed the rebuke of Christ greater riches / the^
the treasures of Egypt. For he hadd respect unto the reward. Whose example
(most goodely indeed) that we may follow / we must alwais have before our eyes
and (as I judge) we must never let slypp out of our minds those most holy most
true and healthefull words of our lord Christ / which I see neade often times
to be repeated and inculcate: Every one that shall knowledge me before men /
him will I knowledge Mat. 10.
also before my father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before
men / him will I also deny before my father which is in heaven. For who so is
ashamed of me and my words / of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he
commith Luc. 9.
i^ his majesty / and in the majesty of his father / and of the holy Angels.
And therefore there are in all places of the scripture most large promises set
furthe to them which do freely confess Christ / and deny Antichriste with a
good courage. John in the book of the Reuelacion / I saw (says he) the
sowles of them which were killed for the name of Jesus and the Apocal. 6.
word of God. And where as in this furst place he hadd writo^ / them which were
killed / he added. And as many as worshipped not the image of the beast / Apoc.
13. 19. 20.
nor did take the marcke in their foreheade / or in their hand / all which /
whom he did se in the very same place / he couplith together and says. And
they lived and reigned with Christ. He says that they lived and reigned with
Christ / not only they which were killed / but they which abiding in the
constau^tnes and confession of true faith / did not worshipp the Image of the
beast / nor received any marks of (...). The blessed Apostle Paul does prove
that we do receive more in the reward of sufferinge / then it is that we do
here suffer i^ the affliction it self / saying: Romans 8.
for I suppose that the afflictions of this life / are not worthy of the
glory which shall be showed upon us. Who is it the^ that will not labor with
all his pour to come unto so great an excellency / that he may become the
friend of Godd / and forthwith joy with Christ? that after famine and
banisheme^t or torments and punisheme^tes / which are but earthely / he may
attayn unto heavenly rewards? If it be a glorius thing for worldly soldiers
to return in to there country triu^phing after they have vanquished their
enemy / how mutch more worthi a thing is it for us / after our flesh the
world and deuell being ouerco^me / to go again with triu^phe into paradise?
And to offer unto Godd a gift most acceptable / faith incor rupte / the sownd
virtue of mind / and sincere confession of faith / a notable praise of
devotion. To come in his company when he co^mith to take vengeance of his
enemies / To stond by his side when he shall lytte down to judge / to be made
the fellow heir of Christ / to be made equal with the angels / to rejoice in
the possession of the heavenly kingdom with the patriarchs / with thapostles /
with the prophets / and all confessors and martirs. What persequution can
vanquishe these thoughts / which are not va^ / but of force / and of pour /
i^ the holy ghost? what torments can overcome them? The mind ons grownded in
these godly meditacio^s does endure strong and stable / and that mind abides
immutable against all the terrors of the deuell / and the threttes of the world
/ and of Antichriste / that mind I say which the certain and sure faith of
things to come does strenghthe^. The eyes be shutt up in these persequutions
of the earth / but heaven is open. Antichriste threatens / but the lord
Christ defendith. The world is taken from him that is killed / but paradise is
given to him being thereunto restored. Te^porall life is taken away / but the
everlasting life is repaired. What a dignity (o brethern) is it / how great a
safety / for a man to depart myrily from hens / to depart so through
oppressions and trobles? It is a glorius thing to shutt up the eyes in a
moment / with which men and the world were seen / and forthewith to open the
same to se Godd and Christ. But that we may behold these things in mind and
thought / that we may (I say) night and day meditate these things / and
sincerly confess the holy name of Christ / and escape and tread down al things
which are contrary to pure confession / we must diligentlly pray unto that
same our heavenly father through Jesus Christ our lord.
