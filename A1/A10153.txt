Here begynnethe a little treatise which is called the.xii. profytes of
trybulacyon.





HEre begy^neth a lityl short treatise y tells how there were.vii. masters
assembled together euerycheone asked other what thing they might best speak
of that might plese god and were most profitable to the people And all they
were accorded to speak of trybulacion.
THe first master said yt if any thing had be better to man lyuyge in this
world than tribulation god would have give it to his sone but for he saw well
ther^ was nothy^g better tha^ it therefore he gafe to him and made him to suffer
most tribulacyon in this wreched world more than did ever oni man or ever
shall. The second master laid that if there were / any man in this world
that might be with out spotte of sin as our lord Ihu Christ was. And might
live xxx years and it were possible without mete or drink And also were so
devout in prayers that he might speak wy^h Angels in the air as did mari
Mawdelyne yet might he not deserve in that life so great mede as a man
deserves in suffrynge a little trybulacyon.

The third master said that if it so were yt the mother of god and all the
halowes of heaven prayed all for one man yet should they not get him somoche
medene so great as he should get himself by meekness in suffrynge a lityll
tribulation. The fourth master said we worship the cross for our lord Ihu^
crist hyng there upon bodily but I seye: were should rather and by more right
and reason have in mind the tribulacyon that he suffered there upon for our
giltis and our trespase / The fifth master seyde I had lever be of might and
strenght and of power suffer the leest pain of tribulacyon that our lord
Ihu^ christ suffered here in earth with mekenes in heart than the mede or the
reward of all worldly goods For as saint petir seyth that none is worthy to
have tribulacyon without error / For tribulacyon quenchyth syn^e / And it
lerneth a man to known ye priuytees of god And tribulacyon makes a man to
know hy^self and his euencriste^ / and multiplieth virtues in a man and
bourgyth him and clensyth him right as fire does gold / And what man that
mekely in heart sufferith tribulacyon god is within him and beryth that heavy
charge with him of trybulacyon and tribulacyon byeth again time yt was lost and
holds a man in that the way of right wysnes / And of all yeftys that god
yeueth unto man tribulacyon is the most wotrhy yefte also it is Tresoure to
the which no man may make comparison and tribulation Joins a mannys soul
unto god.

Now asks the syxte Master why we suffer trybulatyon with so evil will And
it is answered and said for three things. The first is for we have lytylle
love to our / lord Ihesu Christ The second is for we think little of the
great mede that god will give us therefore Ne of the great mede and prouffyte
that comyth thereof The iii is that we think fulle lytill or naught of the
bitter peynes and the great passion that our lord Ihesu christ sufferid for
us in redemco^n of our sins and to bring us to his bliss that never shall
have end amen

Prologus Here seweth a prologe upon the xii. prouftites or advantages of
tribulacions.
DA nobis domine auxiliu^ de tribulatione etc Lorne god grant us help of
trybulacion To the soul that art distroubled and tempted To the is purposed
the thou shulde^^ learn whereof tribulation seruen and not oonly that thou
should suffer / them patiently and gladly and comfort the Inwardly of that
thou art discomforted / For seneca says Non ^stita magna consolacio sicut
illa q^ ex desolato^ne extrahitur Here is none so great co^fortas is yt yt is
drawn out of disco^forte which comfort may noma have but he know first you
fruit of tribulacion yt is to seye But he know how god sendith tribulaco^ns and
ordeyneth hem to the prouffite of the sufferers But if so be that rebellis of
frowardenesse wythstonde the ordenaunce of god Therefore they that know herd
fawtes on that oo party and the prouffites of tribulaco^n on that other party
asken to be help in tribulacion and not tribulaco^n to be / put away from
hem For if they askyn putting away thereof they askyn ayens hemselfe As saint
poule did which asked thries the pryckyng of his flesh to be done away To
whom god answered thus it ad Corinthios xii Sufficit tibi gracia mea My grace
suffycith to the Many prouffites there ben of tribulaco^n

But of.xii. I purpoos to speak in special in which who so will with good
diligence read or here hem may lightly by goodis grace savor hem For right
as mete evil chewed is evil to defye right so neclygently teching of holy
write read. or hard prouffiteth litill or noghte.

De prima vtilitate tribulacionis Ca: i.
THe first prouffite of tribulaco^nis understood that is a true socoure or
help sent fro god to deliver the soul fro the hand of his enemies which
enemies ben thise Prive suggestions of the fend that world that cruel enemy
false Joys and richesse of ye world that disceyuable e^nemye unclean lustis
of the flesh that homly en^mye These enemies slain the soul in so much the
mo perlyously that they deceyuen it with falls feigned frendshyppe so preuely.
The which ben fygured by Ioab ii. regum.xx. That feyned him friend to Amase
holding him by the chynne as he would have kyssed him and so with his sword
in that other hand preuely slew him.

Upon this seyeth saint gregorye if any fortune is to be dredde much more is to
be dredde prosperyte than aduersyte as shows openly

And not well that god ordeyneth all things in tribulation to the delyueraunce
of his servant as he behotyth by the profete david saying thus. Cum ipso sum
in trybulatione eripiam eum et / glorificabo eum

I am with him in tribulacion I shall deliver hy^ of trybulacion and I shall
gloryfye him for trybulacion. For as much then as god is with us i^
trybulation we should suffer it patiently and gladli for the more fhat
trybulation greuyth the. the more nerer god nygheth to the as the prophet
says. Iuxta est dominus hus qui tribulatio sunt cord et humiles spiritu
salitabit

Our lord god is fast by to them that been in tribulation of heart and he
shall save them that been / meke of spyryte Therfofore if the pain of
trybulacion makes the heavy and greuith the. The might and the mercy of god thy
savior that is with the in tribulacyon should Inwardly comfort the.

But now perauenture thou myghteste answe^ ^co^n I feel well But swetnesse of
his felishyp in trybulatyon feel I none For if he showed to the present
swetnesse of his myrthe as he does the bytternesse of trybulatyon thou should
suffer it. Also perauenture you would say that before tribulacyon you feleste
more swetnesse in god than thou did when thou were in trybulation Hereto may
be answred that the frendshyp of god in trybulation is understand in two
manners. First right as trybulatyon encresyth so god multiplyeth grace and
virtue as the appostle says. in co^r.

Fidelis est enim deus qui non pacietur vos te^ptati supra in quod potestis sed
faciet eliam cum te^ptacione prouentum vt possitis sustinere God is full true
that behotyth to defend his servants in trybulacion which shall not suffer
you to be temted more than ye may suffer but also more over he shall make
puruyaunce in trybulation that ye may suffer it that is to say he shall give
grace and virtue for to suffer trybulation patiently and gladly Example as
lords send socoure and help to comfort / their servants yt ben in
castelles byseged of their enemies.

Right so our lord god sends comfort of grace to souls that been byseged
with temptacyons of trybulation. The second manner of felyshyp of god in
tribulation as the Appostle seyeh / prima. cor ^ii.

Sicut habu^da^t passio^es Cristi i^ vobis Ita habu^dat co^solatio vtera As ye
passions of christ e^crease^ in us so encressyth our comfort cristys passions
encreasih i^ us when they ben sent from him mekely and pacientli suffer hem as
gooddys seruauntys and not as: mensleers and thefes which have deseruyd that
they suffer and understand well that comfort of grace in tribulacionis is not
always yeuen to be felt of him that is in trybulacon And that is for he should
preue himself he should dread god and trust in him to be delyuerd / And we
read in ye book of holy faders of saint anton How he after many spirituel
temtacyons was trobled of fendis bodilyche betyn and wounded all his body So
that when his servant came to visyte him lyenge as deed And so he took him
up and bare him in to the next town where he was watchyd tille about mydde
night / And then^e by the will of god he releued and bade his seruau^te
pryuely all other slepyng bear him again and so he did And when he was broute
again thither so feeble that he might not stand but sittynge up he seyde thus /
where be ye evil spiritys wyked fendys / Loo I am here by the might of god
ready to wythstonde al your malice And after these and many other wonderful
temptations our lor appeared to him in a wonderfulle light and comfortable To
whom holy saint Anton said. Aa lord Ihesu Christ where haste thou ben so /
long from me in trybulacyon

And our Lord answered and said here with / the beholding thy fighting ready
to reward the thy vyctory as I am wont to do for my chosen children / For
wit thou well that comfort owes not to come till that a place be arrayed
thereto by trybulacyon / Also we read of / Sare ye daughter of Raguel.
Thobie.iii.

Hoc autem acertum habet omnis qui coltes te quia vita eius si in temptacioue
fuerit coro nabitur. Si autem in tribulaco^ne fuerit liberabitur Et si
correpco^ne fuerit ad miserecordiam tuam peruenire licebit Non enim delectaris
in perdicionibus nostris quia post tempestatem tranquillum facis and post
lacrimacionem and fletum exultacionem infundis Eueri man that worshippeth the
god has this forcerteyne that if his life be here in temtaco^ne he shall be
crowned And if he be in tribulaco^n he shall be delyuerd And if he be in
chastisinge It shall be leefull to come to thy mercy / Thou delyghtes not in
our perisshinges For after tempestys thou make tranquillytee And after
teeris and weeping you sendeste gladness as the prophet seythe

Secundum multitudinem dolorum meorumco^ solaciones tue letificauerunt animam
meam. After the multitude of my sorrows in my heart thy comfortes have glad my
soul His conforte of one hour ouerpassyth the sorrows of trybulaco^n of many
years For god that comes for to help and comfort after tribulaco^n shall
abide with the gladynge thy soul And perauenture if thou playnest the that
thoue taryeste ouerlonge abidinge his comfort as lovers be wont to playue
Herto answerith a great clerk casiodorus.

Ipsa velocitas dei desideran ti et amanti tarditas videtur The swyftnesse of
god to a disiryng and a loving soul seems long taryeng Or thus a thing
that is much coueyted seems great taryeng to a loving soul then of thise
to forseyde may be concluded that a soul discomforted in trybulaco^n owes
not to hold himself overcome of his enemies but rather delyuerd Sithe then
yt this is sothe that tribulacyons deliver us from our enemies though it so
be that they be sometime heavy and chargeable yet nevertheless they should be
suffird patiently and gladly without grutchyng For if we grutche again
tribulacyons then we strive again our helpers and we help our enmyes And for
we be not strong of our self to deliver us from our enemeys pray we to god
mekely seyenge with the prophet

Da nobis domine axilium de tribulacione Lord god grant us help of
tribulacyon

De secunda vtilitate tribulacionis
THe second prouffite of tribulaco^n is that it stoppith the malice of the
fend For he is aferde to tempte the soul that is in tribulaco^n for he
dredith him to be overcome or else refusid and that is figured by the frendis of
Job / where it seyde Job. iii.

Nemo loquebatur ei verbum videbant enim dolorem eius vhementem No man spoke
to him a vode they saw his sorrow was so great These feyned frendys of Job
betokim wicked fendys that vexenor trauaylne souls which dare not come nyg he
a soul that is in tribulacyon nepteme it being distroubled / And not oonly
tribulacyon stops the malice of the fend but also there thorough the
comofret of angels and of saints as we read of holy faders mauy one of which
one comes to my^de Abotte sysoy after monk suffering of certain tribulacyons
and dissesis A litill to forye soul should part from the body He said
brethern beglade loo holy anton comes to us and soon after he said loo here
comen the worshipful company of prophetys And the thirdde time he said Now
comen that holy apostses and as it seemed hem that stood about he spoke with hem
and then they prayed him that he should tell hem with whom he spoke and he
answered and said with holy Angles that came to take my soul And I prayed hem
abide a while that I should suffer more penance And theyse words seyde the
spirit passid with great light All they feeling a wonderful sweet savor
Noot well that there is no peril in tribulacion of temptacions so that thou
answer not to hem by delectacyon or consentyng as the speech of an openly
cursyd man noyeth notte but if thou answer him That is fygured in holy writ
Where it is seyde / I say xxxvi Mandauerat enim rex Ezeehas ne populus
responderet blasphemus rapsacis Kyn Ezechie commaundid that the people should
not answer to the blasfemyes of that tyrant Rapsacis By Rapsacis is
understand the fend And by his blasphemies ben understand temptacyons of
wicked thoughts the which noyen not but if you wylfully assente to him / And
if thou feel the feeble by freelte of thy flesh / pray thou god besely in
trybulacyon / that he stope the malycyous temptacion of the fend / as the
prophet says Lord god grante us help of trybulacyon.

De tercia vtylytate trybulacionis
THe third prouffyte of trybulacyon is that it pourgeth the soul But it is to
wit that there is v manner of pourgynges one is pturgynges of mannis body for
corruption of wycoked humors and that is on two manners. One isby medicinable
drinking / Another is by craft / blood letynge / The second pourgynge is
metally as gold by the fire and Iren by the fyle / The third pourgynge is of
trees / as of vynes of unfruitful branches The fourth purgynge is of corn ad
betynge or thresshyng with a flayle The fyfth pourgynge is of grapes and that
is by a pressoure / On / thus many many manner god does pourge the soul by
trybulacion For as the body is pourged by medycynable drynkes of evil humures
/ Right so the soul made clean by trybulation sent by our souereyne leche our
lord god of vein affeccyons and evil manners For saint Gregorye says.

Mali humores sunt mali mores

Evil humors ben evil manners.

Drink this medycyne of trybulacyon sent to the fro god For he is a wise
leche and knowyth all thy preuy syknesse / and how much thou may suffer and
how much thou nedeste. Foche sends the nothing but that is prouffytable to
the / And he that has rasted and allayed and drank it before the not for
himself / but for thy purgynge he suffered ye passion of death / Whereof he said
to the apostles John^ and James. M / xx. Potestis bibere calice^ quem ego
bibiturus sum. May ye drink the passion that I shall drink / Then sythen
this wise leche has dronken this medicine for thy love / Drink thou thereof
wythonten dread for it is hol / some. This drink thrysteth the profete dauyd
wha^ he said. Calicem salutaris accipiam et nomen domini inuocado. I shall
take the holsom passion of trybulacyon / And if thou think it better clepe thy
lord god into thyn help as he said Da nobis domine etc. Lord god grant us
help of trybulatyon. And as a purgacyon should be resceyued hastily without
any more tastynge or long tarienge so should trybulation be accedice wylfully
wtoute argumentis of disputyng or rebellyon of grutchynge But now be well ware
For sometime as the prouffite of the medicyne is lettyd and werkyth the contrary
to corrupcion Not for the defaute of ye medycyne but for the evil disposycyon
of him that receynyth it / So in the same wise the prouffyte of tribulatton is
lettyd of purgacyon and does ye contrary For it is beginning of pain after
which folowith everlasting dampnacyon As we read of king Pharao King of
egipte For the more that he was visited by tribulacyon the more his rebellynge
heart encresid in to his dampnacion The second purgaco^n of man^es body for
evil humors is by crash blood letynge and yt is on two manners as by openyng
of ye vein or else by boxyng or ve^tusyng Opening of ye vein is approprid to
confession and boxyng or ve^tusynge to tribulacyon And note well ye ryte as
foul blood corruptith ye body so syn^e which is callid in holy writ blood
defouleth ye soul The vein by yt which this blood or sin is voyded out is
the mowthe as it is seid prou^x Vena vite os iusti qr iustus i^ principio
accusator e^sui The mouth of a ritfullman is a vein of life. Forth
rightfulle man in the beginning blameth-hymselfe that is to seye by confession
and also note that as a man owyth by this vein to void out wicked blood to
pourgyng of his body and keep / the good blood to his norisshinge right so
in / confession he owes by his mowthe to show all his sins and wythholde
and keep preuy all his good / dedis for fere of lesing For good dedis showed
in / confesson by vein glory or auau^tyng turnen from virtue unto vice for
defaute of wise keeping / As we read of the pharise that said luc xviii.
Gracias tibi ago dne quia non sum sicut and ceteri hoi^m / raptores adusteri
velut eciam hic publicanus ieiu no bis in sabato decimas de hominu^ que posidio
Lord I thank ye for I am not like as other / men robbers and auoutrers Also
not like this publicane I fast twyes in the weke I pay tithes of / all that I
have Loo here thou may understood / by this pharisee a false feyned and a
proud confession Sed publicanus a long stans noluit ad celu^ oculos leuare
fed percuciebat pectus suu^ dice^s Deus propicius esto in peccatori. But ye
publicane stondinge aferre behind holdyng himself unworthy would not life up
his eye^ to heaven but he smote his heart and seyde God have mercy on me And so
this publicane yeede thens justified or made right by his very / meke
confession To this accords ye very prophet / David where he seyth thus Dixi
co^fitebor aduersu^ mei iusticia^ mea^ dno^ and tu remisist^ impietate^ peccati
mei I shall knowleche by meke co^fessyon ayens myself to my lord mine
vnrightwysnes and you / haste foryeue^ ye wyckidnes of my syn^e Boxyng or /
ve^tusing accords to tribulaco^n For as many disesis as god sendith to ye in
tribulaco^n so many remedies he ordeyneth for thy purgaco^n But not well as
it is needful a fore ventusing ye flesh to be / hette and chauffyd for then^
ye smyttyng of ye blood Iren may be suffrid more esely So it is spedefull
before tribulaco^n yt ye heart be heted with perfigh love and charitee yt
re^taco^n of tribulaco^n may be suffrid ye more pacie^tly and gladly in figure
hereof the holy ghost came down to the apostels in lykenes of fire By whom they
were so strengthed comforted they were glad and yeden Ioyenge for they were^
had worthy to suffer tribulacion anger and repress for the name of Ihu^ The
which before that time were so dredefulle that they fled a way fro / him And
some forsook him as Peter that was prince of the apostles for fere of a woman
swore that he knew him not ye which aftir the coming of / the holy gooste
drade not the cruel tourmentis of / Nero the Emperor But pacyently and gladly
suffrid to be crucified and deed The second manner of materyall purgacyon is
of metals as gold by / fire and Iren by fyle For right as the fire departith
gold from other metals and prougyth him / of ruste and filthe and makith it
fair and clean So tribulacyon departith the soul fro his adversaries And
makes him to god lovely and acceptable / and therefore it is said Sapiensee
quinto Tanquam aurum in furnace probauit electos dominus and quasi holocasta
hostie accepit illos et in tempore erit respectus eorum Our lord has prouyd
his chosen by tribulacyon as gold is prouid in the / furneis and he has
acceptid hem as sacrifice of offeeryng and in time of reward they shall be
behold with this fire of tribulacyon As Job was prouyd when he seide Job xxiii
Probat me deus sicut aurum quod perignem transit God prouuith me by /
tribulacyon as gold that passith by the fire and / note well that among all
metallis gold is most precyouse and led is lest of price And yet
nevertheless gold is not pourgit wyhoute led For led / drawyth with him in ye
furneyse the fylthes of ye gold On the same manner chosen souls the which ben
lykned to gold ben pourged by evil men which ben lykened to lead Whereof
Salamon says Stultus seruit sapienti. The fool shall serve the wise man /
Evil men shall serve to pourge good men by trybulacyon / Also as Iren is
pourged by the fyle of ruste and made shyninge and bright so is the soul
pourged by trybulacyon from uncleanness and comforted with ghoostly light and as
a knyfe that is not vsyd abydyng in the shethe drawyth ruste so the soul
without exercise of tribulacyon desyryth unclean lust as we read of david ii
regum ii When he was without tribulacyon of weringe with his / enmyes fell in
to auoutre with the wife of vrie yt / worthy knight and aftyr into homicyde or
man / ne slaughter Therefore seith the prophet Jeremy Fertile fuit moab in
diebus adolescencie sue et / requieuit in fecibus suis Moab the which is
vndrestonde the sone of my people was plenteuouse by / grace in time of his
tribulacyon and he has restid in filthes of sin Then grutche not ayens
god / when he fyleth thy soul to make it fair and clean lovely and lit For
else may it never come to have of him that blessid sight whereof it said M.
quinto Beati mundo cord quoniam ipsi deum videbunt Blessid been they that be
clean of heart for / they shall see god The iii manner of purging that accords
to tribulacyon is of trees as cuttyng of vynes or voydyng vnfruytfull branches
Whereof criste seythe I xx.

Omnium palmitem in me non ferentem fructum tollet eum Et omnem qui fert
fructum purgavit eum vt fructum plus afferat. Every vine branch that bryngyth
forth no fruit in me that am a very vine my fader that is a tylyer shall kitte
him of and cast him away and that branch yt / beryth fruit / he shall purge
him that he may bring forth more fruit By this vine may be understand mannis
heart by the humure is understand affection or love and by unfruitfully branch
ben understand flessly lusts Inordinate love of creatures carnal affection
of kynred and wordly richesse / When the humures or a vine or of a tree is
spread about lover mani u^frutful branches it bry^geth forth the less fruit or
else none Then it longith to a wise tylyer or to a good Gardener to kitte of
these unfruitful branches that the vine or the tree may bring forth the
vetter fruit and the more Right so almighty god the which is a wise tylier and
a sovereign gardener cuttyth away unclean lusts of ye flesh with the knyfe
of bodyly syknesse he cutyth away Inordinate love of creatures with the hoke
of aduersytee and trybulacyon He cuttyth away carnal affection of kynred with
the sword of death And he cuttythe away worldly richesse with / his Iren rod
/ As brennynge of fire dreuchy^g of water robbyng of thieves and such other On
all these manners does god chastyse and pourge by tribulaco^n For he would that
the love thine heart should abide with him and bring forth plente of
spirytuell fruit in him / and not abide ne trust in such disceyuable
frendshyppe / For saint Gregorye says. Qui autem labet inuititur Necesse est
vt cu^ labente labatur He that lenyth to a falling thing / nedis ye falling
he must fall. The fourth. manner of materyall pourgynge that accordyth to
trybulacionis of corn / as by betynge or thresshynge with a flayle to depart
the corn from the chafe Whereof saint Austyn says. Quod flagello granum quod
fornax auro quod luna ferro hec facit tribulatio viro iusto. As the flayle
seruyth to corn as the fyle seruyth to Iren / so serves trybulation to the
ryghtfull man. As we read that the angelle Raphaell said to thoby hobye.xii.
Et quia acceptus eras deo / Necesse fuit vt temptacio probaret te And for thou
were acceptable to god it was needful that trybulacion should preue the / For
as beti^g of a flayle constreyneth the corn to depart from the chafe so
trybulacion constreyneth the herto for sake the disceyuable love of the world
and the false frendshyp of sinners / Which are understand by chafe. The
prouffyte of this flayle knew the prophet when pe said. Ecce egorn flagella
peratus su^ Lo I am ready to suffer the betynge of tribulacyon and therefore
says saint Austyn / Noly co^querere de flagello tribulacionis si vis he^re
puru^ gratiu^ and reponi cupis i^ celo vbi non nisi puru^ granu^ reponetetur
Plain ye not of ye flayle of trybulacyon if you will have clean corn of
consyence and if you will coueyte to be put in ye garner of ye blys of heaven
in to ye which you may not come till you be clean pourge But be well ware for
as corn yt is grieve and most and not ripe ne dried is not departid from the
chafe with ye beti^g of ye flayle but rather cleueth there to So it is for to
dread ye hertis yt which aren grene in begyn^ynge of conversion and most in
carnal affecco^n yt wihche have not assaid ye prouffite of tribulaco^n ben not
departid from the falsf friendship of her enemies But rather cleuen to he^ as
though they would be co^fortid by he^ For when god sendith us visitaco^ns for
to pourge ye soul yt he louyth be it by bodily sykenes or loss of temporal
gods or aduersite of enemies or any other te^ptacyon of heaviness And one the
heart rennyth al about^ to seek comfort to have mi^de on the Why shuldeste not
be glad when he fendyth to the such tokens of love as he took here for the For
he would yt you should have mind of him and know him For he is thy friend
and will not forgete yt For as many diverse tribulaco^ns as he se^deth to the
so many sondrye messengers you haste cleping and warnyng yt to have mind on
him / But now peraue^tur you would say yt such tribulaco^ns are not most
necessary to clepe yt to have mind on him But rather his gracyous benefaytys
of prosperity / For as seynte Austyn seythe / Dei bn^ficia nil aliud fuit nisi
monico^es veniedi ad eu^ The bn^fytes of god be^ no thing else but warnynges or
clepynges to come to him To this may be answerid al though ye / graciouse
bn^faytes of god as yeftis of prosperitee riches bewte and bou^tee and such
other clepen yt to having to such yeftis that he wythdraweth thyn heart to
have mind rather on the yeftis than on the yeuer wherefore he playeneth by the
prophet seyenge Expandi manus meas et non erat qui aspiciret I have spread out
mine hands that is yeuyng benefices / And there was no man that would behold
Qr omnes diligunt munera et secuntur retribucio^nes. For all men louen yeftis
and they pursuen aftir rewards from the most to the least But ^ewe there ben
or else none that beholden mekely knowy^ge the yeuer of him Also perauenture
thou woldyst seye all though it be according to god to clepe indurate and
rebellyng hertis to know him by tribulaco^n Neuertetheles it nedith not to
good and meke hertys the which desire to know him by benefaytes and yeftis /
To this may be seyde all though good and meke hertys known the yeuerof hem by
natural delityng in benefaytes yet nevertheless to to the prouffite of
perfighte knowing if god may they not come without growyng of tribulacion
Example hereof we reden that Salamon was clepid by benefaytes and yeftis Job was
clepid by drawyng or taking away of his temporell goods and se^dyng him
tribulacions and aduersitees But these tribulacyons brought Job to the perfight
knowing of god Salamon by propirite^e fell in to folly lesyng the prouffite
of perfghte knowing of god Whatsoever thou art trust not that thou myghteste
not long abide in this knowing in such prosperity and therefore suffer
pacientli tribulaco^ns and aduersytees / And if thou be dyscomforted that they
/ be many and great / be thou comforted. For the moo and the gretter that they
ben to the / the more prouffyte of knowing of god they bryngen to the / And if
thou can not feel any comfort for frowardness or freelte of thy self / pray
to god that he comfort the in trybulacyon and grant the grace to come to the
prouffyte of perfyght knowing of him and say. Da nobis domine auxilium de
tribulacione / Lord grant us help of trybulacyon.

De quarta vtilitate tribulacionis. Ca. iiii
THe.iiii. prouffyte of trybulacyon is that it lighteneth the to have the
knowing of god In which is perfeccyon and the prouffyte of mannys knowing /
the which Saint Austyn desired seyenge in the book of answers to himself
Libro soliloquiorum Thus would god I should know the. And also it is wretten
in the book of wysdom. sapiencie quinto. Nosce te iusticia est consummata To
know the lord god it is ryghtfulnesse end of cunning / to this knowing
helpith trybulacyon / For as the roddeconstreyneth a child to bow down his
head / and takes head unto his book / and record his lesson / So trybulacyon
meketh the heart and makyth him to behold his own freelte / and to know god.
Whereof saint Bernerde / Deus facit se congnosci verberando qui oblitus et
incognitus erat percendo. God makes himself to be known in betyng with
tribulacion which was foryetyn and unknown in his meryfulle / sparynge /
Daniel iiii. Of this we have ensample / of the king Nabugodonosor which for
pride was cast out of his kingdom and lived with wild hestis and ete hay as
an ox But when he lift up his eye to his maker of holy heart his wit was
restorid to him again and he knew god that castised- him in tribulacyon As the
manner of chidren when they felen strokes sharp of the rod They leften / up
her eyes to him that smyten him For they wolden that he should turn his face
to hem by pitee / and by compassion. Now then thou lowely soul that art
under the rod of tribulacyon considere and know well that the manner of
lovers is for / to send yeftis tokens and preui lettres each of / hem to other
for to keep love and mind and knowing each to other On the same manner our
lord Ihu^ crist as a true lover sedinth to his treue louyd children such
tokens as he took here for hem For here he took mankind in which he usffrid
many tribulaco^ns detracco^ns blasphemies scorns repreues sclaundres hunger
thirste and cold and many betyngis sharp scourgyngys many thou and is of
great wounds and was naled upon the cross between ii thieves and deyed the
shamefolliste death / that the Jews cowde ordeyne for him and aftir / that he
was risen from death and stied up in to heaven he kept his woundis as for tokens
that thou shuldeste know that the would have mind of the and never forgete
the as he said by the prophet Isaye xlix.

Numquid obliuisci potest mulier infantem suu^ / vt non misereatur filio vteri
sui et si illa oblita fuerit ego tamen non obliuiscar tui Ecce in manibus-meis
descripsi te

Whether a woman may foryete her child that she have no mercy to the son
of her own body And though she forgete her child I shall never forgrete the
Loo I have written the in mine hondis that is in all my wounds which I suffrid
for love of ye sy^hen it is so that he kept the showing of wou^dis as for a
token of love / And it has great dread / there as is no dread as the prophet
sey the I by cecideru^t timore vbi no^ erat timor They fellen down for dread
there as no deed was It may be clepid a cursid comfort that is set rather
in any creature than in god For the prophet Jeremy seyth / ieremiex un
Maledictus homo qui co^fidit in homi^e and ponit carne^ brachi suum and a deo
recedit cor eius Cursid be ye man yt tristyth i^ man and he yt settyth any
creature to be his strenghe and he that departyth his heart from god But it
may be clepid a blessid comfort that is set in god as the same prophet
seide Benedictus vir qui confidit in domino and erit dn^s fiducia eius Blessid
be that man that trustith in our lord god and our lord shall be his trust
/ And when that we shall fully trust oonly in god in all manner tribulacyon And
dread false comfort and evil counseille of our enmyes We / have ensample. of
Ochosyas king that sent mesengers to / Beelzebub the fend of Acharon to have
comfort and counseyle whether he should escape the tribulacyon of sykenes or
none And god sent an angel to the prophet and bad him seye chosie iiii regum
i c Qr misisti nuncios ad consulendum belsabub deum accharon quasi non esset
deus in israel a quo posses interogare sermonem Ideo non descendes de lecto
super quem ascendisti sed morte morieris For thou have / sent mesengers to
ask counseyle of belzabub the / feende of accharon as though there were no
god / in Israel of whom thou myghteste ask comfort therefore thou shalt not
goo out of the bed that thou yediste upon but thou shalt deye Also that we
should not love the world ne trust in worldly thyngis synte Ihon biddith i
Iohis ii Nolite dilegere mundu^ neqmz ea que in mundo sunt Will not ye / love
the world ne worldly thyngys etc. The v. / manner of material purgacion is of
grap is and ytis by a pressour For as a pressour pressith the / grapes to part
the preciose lycour of wine from / draffe and the draggys So god pourgith the
soul that he loves in the presour of tribulacyon from / corrupcyon and
wickidnes of sin Some time / by bodily sykenesse or preuy goostly heaviness
and sometime loss of temporell goods: or persecucion or sclaunder of evil
men and enmyes: Sometime by lacking of noble kynrede / or by death of faith /
full frendys. And therefore suffer pacyentely the: prouffite of this pressour if
thou will be brought into cristes blessed celar of which it is seyte Cant
ii. Introduxit me dommus rex in cellam suam / vinariam The lord the king has
brought me in to his wine seler / Herto accords seinte / Austin and seithe
That holy martirs weren so pressyd by tribulacyon in this present life that
the bodily matter was left in the pressour of this earth / But the preciouse
souls weren resceiued into the / seler of everlasting bliss Grutche not
ayens / god if he has put the in his prison of tribulacyon For he has
assayed it before the As I say the prophet seithe in the person of criste
Isa. lxiii / Torcular calcaui solus and degentibus non est ibimecum I alone
have trodden the pressour of tribulacyon and no man was there with me And note
it that he seide no man but he said not no woman / for that blessid woman
mother and maid our lady saint Marie abode with him in feith full when / all
the apostles fled from him And was ready to suffer death for the compassyon of
her sone as the. prophet Simeon seith luc ii Et tuam ipius animam pertransibit
gladius The sword of death shall pass tho rough thine own soul Now the n^e
sithen this is sothe that our lord Ihu^ criste has assayed this pressour of
tribulacyon and that blessid lady his mother maid marie What so ever thou be
that feliste the in this pressour take it mekely and gladly prayen with the
prophet Da nobis domine auxilium de tribula co^ne Lord god grant us help
of tribulacyon

De quinta vtilitate tribulacionis Capitulum v.
THe v. prouffite of tribulacyon is that it reuoketh or brings the to
knouynge of thyselfe For that heart that has not put away far from
himself worldly and vein glory may not truly feel ne know himself For
that heart has more very knowing of light whereof the prophet Dauit seyde
Numen oculor u^meorum and ipm^ non est mecum Light of knowing there is of mine
eyes but the light is not with me Woo to hy^ that dispenden the light of her
knowing in vain Joy and vorldly things and no thing to desire the knowing
of hemselfe But how should they know himself that been not with himself For
ye more that the soul louyth and desires vain Joy / and worldly
prosperitees the more ferther he drawyth from the knowing of himself And
therefore seythe seinte Gregory As he that is besegid / with enmnyes dare not
goo far out but he is constreinid to goo again for dread. So tribulacion
constreyneth ye heart to torn in to himself. And the. mos aduersytees yt ben
about him the fewer he has of rennynges out from himself. Thene it is. a
blessid aduersitee that brings the in to thyselfe and makes the that thou
have misgoon to turn again. Whereof it is said. Exodus xii. Maneat vnis qi sque
apud seme^ ipsum. Dwell each man With himself that is know he himself Abide
he with himself for as an house which no man dwellith is washd and fallyth
to naught Right so the heart that dwelly^h or abydith not with himself /
Woo to that heart that renneth from himself all about like as does a Iaper
or a Iogelar in to other men's houses more he singith Iapeth and / Ioyeth in
other men's places The more cause / he finds in his own place of sorrow and
of weeping So the more that the heart deliteth him outeward in vain things and
worldly Joys the less he fyndith in himself whereof he should be comfortid
Therefore tribulacyon is full necessary to the / heart to make him turn into
himself / And it co^streyneth him to say with the prophet.

Conuer^ete anima mea in requiem tuam. Turn again thou my soul in to thy rest
/ And also our lord god having pity of the soul that has for wrapped
himself with worldly things seyth thus. Reuertere reuertere sonamitis.
reuertere vt intueamur te. Turn again turn again thou wretch caytyf soull / turn
again / turn again / that we / mow behold the that thou behold thyselfe with
the eye of consyence / and that I may behold the with the eye of mercy. O
thou soul that distroubled in aduersytees / suffer the to be revoked to
knowing of thyselfe by trybulacyon / And namely for that trybulacyon byndeth
or knyttyth the to thy maker Whom wicked and large fredom of the world ha^h
let run long loose from thyselfe Whereof speaks the prophet thus.

Infuniculis adam traham eos et in binculisca ritatis. I shall draw them in
the small cordys of Adam and in the bondis of charytee. These small cordys of
adam our first fader which longen to us by the way of heritage are clepyd
al manner pouertees sent fro god to reserve the heart from vain and worldly
comfortes. by the which god drawyth many one / as it semyth by vyolence.
Whereof says saint Bernarde / Trahimur / cum tribulacionibus exercemur. We ben
drawn when we hauntyd with trybulacyon / therefore thou that art streyned with
these cordys and bondys of charity suppose not that that thou art defoiled or
forsaken but the rather made fair and chosen of god al though thou haste not
that thou askeste / Ne trow not them they ben not streyned with these bondys
to be in very lybertee / though they have that they asken / For like as the
leche when he grauntyth to the syke all that he desyryth it is a certain sign
of death / Right so the false fredom of the world is certain sign of
perysshynge / For the more freely they desyren and fulfyllen their own desire
without trybulacyon / the rather they fallen down in / in to their
dampnacyon. Therefore thou sely soul that / art troubled If thou will have
god to the merciable / suffer the to be restreyned with these bondis of
trybulacyon / Which comen fro god and drawn yt toward god / Wherefore our
lord said to the profete Ezechiel Eccededi viculanica s^^te Lo I have yeuen
my bo^dis upon ye / by this is vndsto^de yt bo^dis upon the By this is
understand that bondys of / tribulacion ben the yeftys of god and the more
tribulacyon the strenger byndeth the soul to god Also the prouffite of
tribulacyon is that it spedith the way to god For as many tribulacyons as thou
haste so many messengers god has sent to the that thou haste to him and not
let by the way Whereof sey the the prophet Multiplicate sunt infirmites eorum
postea acceleuauerunt Her sykenes were multiplied and afterward they hastid
hem to / god Hereof seynte Gregory said Disesis that oppresson us to haste to
god compelle us Supposse thou not the benefytes of tribulacyon to be disese for
/ to deliver the from a grievous prison and to haste thy way to the kyndom of
heaven As it is said / Ecclesiastici uit De carcere cathenisque interdum / quis
introducitur ad regum From prison and from Iron bondis other while a man is
brought into a kingdom This prison is callid all that the heart loved
inordinatly in this world These Iren / bondys are such things that wicked
affeccions / be bounden to. But of this prison god delivers many one by
tribulacyon as when he puttyth away / from hem thyngys that they louen
inordynatly / And that is fygured by seynte / Peter that was kept in herodis
prison when our lordis angel stood beside him and peter's said Ismyten He
excited / him and said arise up lightly And anon the / Iren bondis fell
from his hondys By the side of / petir is understand thy brother that came out
of the same side that thou / came of Orels all thoo generally that aren alyed /
to the by kynrede or by affinitee For when any of this or all which by law of
nature ought to be / thy friend is contraryous to the or else by any other manner
Understand thou art smyten in the side / for that thou shuldist goo out of
the prisone of inordinate love and set thine heart oonly in god that may not
fail the But take good heed that as petir playned not on the smytyng on his
side So thou owe not to plain ne to grieve the of tribulaco^n which
delyuerith the fro the false and disceiuable love and flesshly and worldli
frendis / And if the / smiting of tribulacyon in the side be sharp and /
greuouse to suffer be hold criste thy maker and / thy brother woundid in the
side for thy love and you / shalt suffer it the more casely as a true knight
/ when he sees his lordis woundis therefore refuse-not the messengers of thy
lord god the comen to / clepe the with him and constreyne the to haste toward
him For he that refusyth the mesenger refusyth his lord / When is the
messenger refusyd / when the heart with a vylement co^trarieth and gru^chith
ayens tribulacyon Note well that tribulacyon turmenyth in pourgyng and pourgyth
in / turmentyngh / But when the heart grutchyth ayenste tribulacyon Then he
parts pourgyng from turmentynge For he kepyth the better turmente / of
tribulacyon And he lesith the sweet profitable / pourgynge thorough his folly
and contrarious grutchynge.

De sexta vtilitate tribulacionis. Capitulum. vi.
THe sixth prouffite of tribulacyon is that it is against in payeng of thy dettis
in which thou art bound to god whom thou may / not flee ne disceyue ne hide
no thing from him / of thy dettis These dettis aren penance which / thou
owe for thy sins And though euerlast / ynge penance be debt for one
dedely sin by the / rightwysnes of god in to temporel penaunse by contrycion
and confession And forthermore it is foryeuen by satisfacion and sometime it is
all relesid and namely by tribulacyon Hereof understand well / for what so
ever thou sufferiste pacyently in tribulacyon before god it is acounted to him
as for paymente of thy debt For as a lordis aduitoure / sometime in the end of
acountys lays a counter / of bras or coper or a another thing of little valewe
to be worth or signify an hundryd i pound of gold or silver / So
tribulacyon of little time with / pacyence resceyued in this present life
deliuerith the from everlasting tribulacyon of the payen of / hell And
bryngith the to the everlasting bliss of the rich king of heaven Whereof we
have example of the theyf that hinge on cristeryghte side that when he suffryd
the tourmente of the cross And / was bound by dew debt of sin to the
pain of hell He having contricyon of his wickid. nes in that same houte
turned him to god and said Lord when thou come in to thy kingdom thy^ke on
me / and anon he was vnbounden and delivered of all det of pain. And herd
the sweet voice of christ saying to him. Amen dico tibi hodie mecum eris in
paradiso. Sothely I say to the thou shalt be with me to day in paradyse / Woe
to him that nothing pays of his debt in this life / but addyth sin / upon
sin. Woo to hy^ that / of large expencys that he makyth shall be constreyned
to come to a straight countes. Sothely such yt have lived ever without a
count / must pay for their debt everlasting pain in hell wythouten any
relees There shall vepe many merchants that in this life laughen and / Ioyen
Whereof it is said in the book of the apocalips Mercatores terre flebunt
Marchauntis of the erhte shall vepe Marchauntis of the erhte are thoo that set
all her thought and her love in erhtely thyngys the which shall weep full
bitterly For god / shall show her Marhaundyse to all that world / But
marchau^tys of heaven then shall laugh and / Joy For they shall see that for
litill short tribulacon they have get the bliss of paradise Whereof it / is
said in Eclesiastici Est qui multum redemtt de / modico precio Some other ben
that byen much thing with litill price that is to be paciente in tribulacon
of this present life that god resceyueth for / the great For it is comenly
said of an evil payer / men resceyuen ootys for whete And though it so be
that thou art not bound in any debt of dedely syn ve or venial For which
tribulacyon should deliver the Nevertheless tribulacyon reserueth the from /
falling in to debt as saint Gregorye seide Multa sunt innocencia que cito
innocenciam perderent nisi ea tribulaciones preseruarent Many ben innocente the
which should soon lose Innocence but / if tribulaco^ns preseruen hem
Therefore thou soul that feliste bounden in dettys or thou that drediste the
paymente suffer pacyently tribulaco^ns As long as time endures It pays
tofore thy dettis in the which thou art bounden as by an obligacyon For
though all the tribulaco^ns of this world were togider they might not be
lykened to the least point of tribulacyon of hell

Ne all the trybulacyons of the earth ben not in co^paryson to the least Joy
of paradyse / As saint poule says. Non sunt condign passionis huius te^poris
ad futuram gloriam que reuelabitur in vobis Ad romanos / viii. There ben none
worthy passions of this time / to the bliss that is to come. that / shall be
showed in us / upon this says saint bernarde. Non sunte condign passiones ad
preteritum peccatum quod nobis dimutitur ad presentem graciam. que nobis
immittitur et ad futuram gloriam que nobis promittitur There ben no worthy
passions to the sin that is foryeuen us to the present grace that is yeuen
us and to the bliss that is be hyghte us.

De septima vtilitate tribulacionis. Cap^ vii
THe.vii. prouffyte of trybulacyon is that it / spredith abroad / or opens
thy heart to receive the grace of god / For as a goldsmyth with many strokes of
the hamer spredyth a pyece a broad of gold or of silver to make a vesselle for
to put in wine or precyouse lycoure / So almyghti god maker of every
creature ordeyneth trybulacio^ to sprede or to open the soul to put therein
yeftes of his grace. Wherefore ^eyth the prophet in ye psalm. In tribulacione
delatasti michi.

In tribulacion thou haste spredde a broad or opened to me / Therefore suffer
gladly the strokes of tribulacion. For the more they spredde abroad the / heart
in suffrynge pacyently / the more goostly yeftys our lord god purtyth therein
gracyously / And / considre that as the more precyouse metalle is more ductill
and obeyeng to the strokys of the goldsmyth So the more precyouse a meke heart
is more / pacyent in tribulacyon And all though the sharp / strokys of
tribulacyon grievously turmente the yet comfort the that the goldsmyth almighty
god holds the hamer of tribulacion in his hand and knows full well what
thou may suffir and mesuryht his smytyng after thy freel nature Ne will /
thou not be then as metal in a boystouse gobet / with spredyng of sharp as
herd hertys ben without techynge In which god fyndeth no place of
worchynge^ Ne will thou not be as an old frienge pan that for hete by a
little stroke all to brestyth in many brekynges Right so faren fell and
Impacyente hertys in tribulacyon by a little stroke in temptacyon of assayenge
they fallen in in to many great harms of peyryng therefore suffer with good
will tribulacyon to worche his craft in ye / For so biddith Salamon
Eclesiasticin Sustine sustentacio^es dei coniungere deo et sustine vt crescat
in nouisimo vita tua Suffer the berynge up or the helpers of god to Join the
to god and suffer that thy life encrese in the last end. As who says suffer
trybulacyon in this world for god and yield him some what the time of his
seruyse / And what trybulacyon he puttyth to the take it mekely and know well
that he will not charge the over thy myghte^ As saint Poule wytnessyth Corinth
x. Hidelis enim est deus qui non pacietur vos te^p tari super id quod potestis.
Sothely god is fulle true that shall not suffer you to be tempted over yt that
ye may not suffer / therefore suffer trybulacyon on such manner that thy life
encrese in the last end / For thereby thou shalt live in ye last end amen

De octaua vtilitate tribulacionis. Capitulum. viii
THe.viii. prouffyte of trybulacion is whereby god shyttyth out of the soul
all worldly co^fortes that been here byneth / and con streyueth the to seek
heavenly comfortys that been above. As an erthely lord when he will sell his
wine forbedyth all other to open her tauernes tylle that he has sold his. Sod
our lord god sometime forbedyth erthely comfortes that he may bring forth his
comfortis and that is that be tokeneth by the prophet Joel where it is said.
Bestie agri quasi area faciens ymbrem suspexerunt ad te quoniam exsiccati sunt
fontes aquarum The bestys of the field ben as dry earth desyry^ge rain they
loken up to the sea. for the well of waters ben dry. The bestys of the field
he clepyth affeccyons and flesshely desires / The wells of ye water he clepyth
worldly co^fortes therefore when that / erthely comfortes faylen in aduersytee /
then is ye heart constreyned to look up. and to seek help of heavenly
comfortes. And so much the more benyng is our lord god to the soul. In
asmoche as the heart fyndyth gretter bytternes in outward things But now by
these things thou may say I am so sorry that the tauern of erthely comfortes
is not open to me But for the tauern of heavenly comfortes is so long shite fro
me For another hier ne lover I find no comfort To this may be answered thus
thou oweste not to have goostly comfortys but If thou besye the desiring and
sykynge For there / is more myrthe in desiring and seeking god than in the
delytynge of him For why the more thou desireste and sekeste god the more
comfort he shall / bring that And that more swetnesse find in him As the
mete sauoureth more to an hungry man than to an vnhungry man. And wit thou
well that heavenly comfortes shall not long be dyfferyd if worldly comfortes be
shytte out by trybulaco^ns if thou ask desyryngely and seek besely / as
Salamon said. Desiderium suum justice dabitur To ryghtwysmen shall be yeuen
here their desire

De nona vtilitate tribulacionis. Capitulum ix.
THe ix. prouffyte of trybulaco^n is that it puttyth the in to the mind of god
/ and the more tribulacion be / the more he impressith the in his mind / Not
for that god foryetyth the / or any creature the which sees and knowyth all
the preuytees of thy heart But for scripture says god foryetyth a man that
trybulaco^n is yeuen to. For to him that he sendyth trybulacion he has in
mind yeuynge goostly comfort / and encreasynge of grace / Therefore thou good
soul / if thou will be / put in mind. In whose mind is thine help and thy
salvation / In whoos foryetynge is thine harm and thy dampnacyon / learn for
to suffer pacyently aduersytees and trybulacyons / and in suffrynge think
mekely in god / and he eftsoon shall think mekely and mercyably. For a true
friend thinks fervently on his friend that is dessese / In figure hereof our
lord said. Exodie. iiii. Vidi affliccionem populi mei: in egipto et clamo^em
eius audi ui etces. I have seen the dissesis of my people that is in Egipte /
and I have herd the cryenge For the duresse of hem that been the overseers of
the works And I knowing her sorrow have goon down to deliver hem from the
hondis of the Egipcians Therefore all though the egipcians that is to say evil
men or enmyes tourmenten and disesen the be thou comfortid For the merciable
behouldyng of god in thy disese much more auaylith the as we read of David ii
regum xvi. Fleing from absolon his sone that seems the which was David enmye
coursid him and spoke evil to him and said. Egredere egredere vir sanguinum et
vir belial. As / whoo leyth goo thy weye thou man of sins and thou man of
beliall And abisay that was david friend seenge this said to king david This
deed hounde has myssayede or cursid my lord the king I shall goo and smite
of his heed And david an^wer^d suffer him to myssaye or curse david upon the
comaundmente of god Paraueture god will behold my desese and yield me good
for this myssayenge or the cursinge this same day / Considre in this that
david would suffer the myssayng or the cursynge of this adversary that he
might goote the blessyng of god then look how much thou desyreste / the
blyssyng of god and suffer somoche the more pacyently the myssayeng or cursyng
of time aduersite.

For pacyence of evil mennys cursyng deserves / to have goddis blessyng and
that is tokened where it is seyde danielis iii. That the angel yeede down
with Azarie and his fellows into the furneys And he made the mids of the
furneys / as a blowyng wind of a dew but the flamme burnt the kyngis
ministres that hette the furneys But sothely the fire touchid ne greuid hem in
any manner Loo here thou may see that the fire not oonly burnt their fomen
but also it refresshid hem the which is understand that criste is present
with / hem the ben in tribulacyon and yeuith hem fressyhnge in dysese and
blessid him that been myssayde or / cursyd for his name Therefore if thou desire
refresshinge tribulacyons and thine enmyes to be burnt suffer pacyently
tribulacyons For in tribulacyon / god is with the and fro trybulacyon he shall
deliver yt and for trybulacyon great mede he he shall yield yt. Cu^ ip^o su^ in
tribulacio^e eripia^ eu^ and Glorificabo eu^ I am with him in trybulacyon. lo
here a gracious felyshyppe comforty^ge I shall deliver him Loo here a fulfeyth
of delyuerynge and I shall gloryfye him / loo here a certain hope of rewardynge

De decia vtilitate tribulacionis Capitulum X
THe x. prouffite of tribulacyon is that it makyth thy prayer to be hard of
god / For it is not ye manner of god to put away the prayer of him yt is in
trybulacyon / but ye rather mekely to here his preuy prayers / Whereof Salamon
said. Ecce dep^catione^ lesi exau diet dn^s. Loo our lord shall here the
prayer of him that is hurt / Sothely god smyteth and chastysyth many men and
sends, them trybulacyon for to compel them / to ask or to cry mercy and
that they should open her mowthes to god in tribulacyon for to ask help which
had shue her mowthes from him in prosperitee whereof says seynte Austyn that
god sendyth tribulacyon to some men to stire hem to ask that he would grant
In the person of such seyth ye prophet Ad dominum cum tribularer clamaui and
exaudiuit me When I Was in tribulacyon I cried to our lord and he hard me
And though / all it hap that in prosperitee thou prayeste god / that
prosperity should not make the to slow Yet nevertheless it makes the some time
both insolent and slow so that thy prayer in prosperity is not / spedeful as
it is inaduercitee occupy so much thy heart that thou thynkeste that it
has none entente ne devotion like as it had in prosperity yet that / same
aduersite makith thy prayer more precyouse And sothely all though tribulacyon
oppresset the so much that thou may. not open thy mowthe to cry to god
certynly this tribulacyon cries and prays to god for the so that thou have
pacyence for as seith a great clerk. Petir of lazer that as many woundis as he
had so many prayers or cryers he had / to god For when lazer stillid with his
mouth his woundys cried to god for him whereof our lord / seide to caym that
had killid his brother abelle Genesis / Vox sanguinis fratris tui abel clamat
ad me de terra The blood of thy brother abel cries to me fro the earth Thus
then it shewyth that / tribula^ (...) more precyouse and ye more acceptable
to god Tribulacyons ben as it were a paymente for alettir selyd of delyueryng
Whereof seyth Job. Quis michi det vt ueniar peticio mea and quod expecto tribuat
michi deus qui cepit / me ipse me conuertat soluat manum suam et succidit me et
michi sit consolacio vt astligens me dolotem meum non percat Who shall give me
mine / asking and who shall grant me that I abide / god that began he
convert me lose he his hand and kite me up and that it be to my comfort that
he / tormentynge me spare not my sorrow Not well yt that Job that had lost his
possessions his sons / and his daughters and all his body was smyten with
wounds or sepre from the soole of the soote unto ye ouerest part of the head
/ And was repreued of his frendis and scorned of his wife and of his false
fre^des He desired in no other thing comfort but that god should not spare him
It thou ask what perteyneth to his delyuerynge it may be aunswerid thus the
asking of his affeccyons or tourmentes / For his tourmentys were paymentys of
his leters as it is vsid in some place that when a pour man drinks in a
tavern and has not wherofe to pay his scote He asks to be betyn and so to
be desiue If you askist wherein was his comfort of this Iob^ When he asked to
be turmentyd. Saint Gregory answeryth and says / That god sparyth some here
in this world to tourmente they in afterward and some he tourmentyth here the
which he / will afterward spare. The comfort of Job was that he wyste well
by present trybulacyhe should escape everlasting dampnacyon For as it is
said Non indicabit bis deus inidip^m God shall never punysshe or deem twyse
for one thing. And therefore this same Job that asked yt god should not spare
him here in this world / asked in a another place and said. Parce michi
domine. Lord spare me in time coming / suffer pacyently here in this world
trybulacyon For tribulacyon saves the soul / as Job said. Ipse vulnerat et
medicinat He wounds and he heleth / For he wounds the body and helyth the
soul.

De vndecima vtilitate tribulacionis. Caplm. xi.
THe xi prouffyte of trybulacyon is that it kepyth and nourysshyth the herte^ /
Sothely / right as fire is kept in ashes right so the hertes of the friends
of god aren kept in trybulacion. Therefore our lord god commanded Exodi Quod
tabernaculum faccis cilicinis cooperietur That the tabernacle of god should de
hyled with heiren sackes the which should the fend / the presious curteynes
of soft sylke / and gods rich vessels of gold or silver ayenste wyndes
and reins In token that virtues of goddis servants named menes ben kept in
aduersytee of trybulacyon. For trybulacyon constreyneth the heart to think on
the / wretchydnesse of his own Infyrmytee / And so it constreyneth a man to be
meke. Whom worldly prosperytee had haunsyd by vay^glorye above hy^self Also
trybulacyon nourysshyth the heart as a norys / she her child. For as the mother
with the child cheweth hard mete / the which the child may not chewe / and
draws it in to her body where that mete / is turned into milk to
nourysshynge of the child So christ that in holy write is cleped our mother
for the gretnesse of his tender love that he has to us He chewed for us bitter
pains / hard words re / preues / and sclaundres with bytternesse of his
passion that suffered for us to nourysshe us / and strey / neth us goostly by
ensample of him to suffer trybulacyons and aduersytees of this world. As wine
that is cleansed thoroughe a bag fulle of spyces / changes his own sauoure
drawing to him the sauoure of the spyce / So a man suffrynge trybulacyons and
aduersytees of this world owes to cle^synge by the blessed body of our lord
Ihesu considering the passion that he suffered for him / And so it shall wexe
swear and tolerable that to foresemyd full bitter and intolerable.

De duodecuna vtilitate tribulationis. Capitulum xii
THe.xii. prouffyte of trybulacyon is that trybulacyon is a certain token of
love that god has toward him that it is sent to Whereof he said. Quos amo
arguo et castigo. Him that I love I vndernymme and chastyle / And also Salamon
said Ecclesiastici. Qui diligit fililiu^ assidua et flagella^ He that loves
his son he scourgyth him often time. Whereof said saint Jerome. Summus pater
Ihesus Christus filios suos semper sub aliquo flagello vel virga retinet vt /
quando eripiuntur ab vno sub alio capiuntur. Our souereyne lord Ihesu christ
kepyth ever / his children under a scourge or a rod And when they ben
delivered of one / they ben caughte under / a another / But our good meke fader
and lord sent not all his scourgis at ones to geder / but one after a another
knowing our freelte / For he will that no man perysshe / but he will all men
be safe / But evil men and unkind that believe him not ne louen him the which
lyuen here without scourge of of trybulacion. Whom no correccyon of
chastysy^ge may wythdrawe from their errors god shall punysshe with all his
arowes of vengaunce / For sothely all tourmentys that now ben departed about
in all the world then shall be gadered together and abide as in her own
place / As our lord said Deutrononni xxxii Congregabo super eos mala. et
sagitas meas complebo in eis. I shall gader together evil things upon
euyllmen. And I shall spend all mine arowes of vengaunce among hem. Therefore
thou good soul if thou will be beloved of god will thou not put away
trybulacyons. For they shown to the tokens and wytnes of the love of god. But
perauenture if thou sayste ye goddys children taken of him both good things
and evil things. Why is the taking of euylle things shewy^ge or token of ye
love of god more tha^ ye taking of good things. To this may be answered that
god yeuith many good things and great to his spyrytuell frendis and bitter and
gretter to / them that he louyth more / But the blessed fader of heaven loved
without comparyson more his blessid sone our lord Ihesu criste than all the
world and yet he sent him here many anguesshes pouertees tribulacyons
aduersytees repreues and / scornynges betynges bydynges scorgynges many wounds
and cruelle death but few temporell goodis Then is the yefte of aduersitee
more shewinge token of love of god than the yefte of temporelle prosperitee /
Also ferthermore our lord Ihesu criste goddis sone that leued here in this
world as a wise marchau^te chose good marchaundyse and refused the badde / For
when they would have made him king of Jude he refusid it and chase rather / to
flee in to deserte And when they sought him to tourmente him and to slay him
he fleddee not but / he chase rather for to deye and said. Ego sum I am he
whom ye seek Then if criste was wyseste i^ chesynge ye which chase
aduersitees they ben: much foles that dispisen tribulacyon and aduersy / tees
and chesen worldly prosperites that may not deliver hem in time coming from
the hondes of her enmyes the cruel fendis Suffer then pacyently with criste
here tribulacyons that thou may take afterward the crown of life in the
bliss of / heaven For sothely otherwise thou may not come to the bliss For
the apostle says Per mulcas tribulaciones oportet nos intrare in regum celoru^
It behouyth us by many trybulacyons to enter in to the kingdom of heaven / He
bring all us that suffered death / our lord Ihesus. AMEN.
