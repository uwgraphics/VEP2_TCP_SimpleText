COR VNV^, VIA VNA.



TO THE RIGHT HONOrable, Sir William Cecill Knight, Baron of Burghley, Lord
high Treasorer of England. William Swayne wishes long life, and the same to be
most healthie and happy.
RIght Honorable my singular good Lord, there came to my hands of late a book
containing all the tunes of the Psalms, as they are ordinarily soung in the
Church, composed into four parts by M. William Damon late one of her Majesty's
servant, which book being found not only in my poor opinion, but in the
riper judgment of some special Musicions to be excellently set, either to
serve for voices or instruments: for the great use that might come thereof, and
partly to preserve the labors of the Auctor, so worthy and skillfull a man
in his profession: also to leave his Religion and piety herein witnessed, that
so carefully and specially labored to advance the use of singing the
Psalms: I was earnestly dealt with all not to deteyne that as a part of my
private store in Music, that of it self contained matter so worthy
publicly to enterteyne and to receive enterteynment. Therefore with their
persuasions and reasons, I was brought to publish them for the use and comfort
of all, especially of the godly. And now right honorable my very good Lord,
calling to mind the duty, honor, and service due by me unto your good
Lordship, for the great love and favor which I have always received at your
L. hands. (For I acknowledge my self to none more bound then to your honor:) I
have been the more emboldened to present this simple work to pass under your
L. favor and protection. Wishing that the same may chiefly serve to the
glory and praise of God. And then at your L. pleasure, at some times for the
recreation of your mind, after your worthy and great travail from day to day
taken in the most weighty affairs of this commonwealth. And so I commend your
good L. to the merciful keeping of thalmightie God.

Your good L. most bound during life, William Swayne.

To the Reader.
HEretofore gentle Reader, M. William Damon one of her Majesty's Musitions,
being earnestly requested by a friend of his did at sundry times when he
resorted to his friends house compose the tunes of David's Psalms as they are
ordinarily soung in the Church note for note, intending the^ for his friends
private use. These Psalms so set, and made without labor or purpose to
publish them, were notwithstanding published by the same friend of M. Damon;
which not answering thexpectation that many had of the Auctors skill, gave him
occasion to take upon him a new labor to recover the wrong his friend did in
publishing that that was so done, as might well please him, but was not
purposed or framed for the learned ears of our times. Therefore at his best
leisure and fittest times he composed the same tunes again in so excellent a
manner that by comparison of these and the former, the Reader may by trial see
that the Auctor could not receive in his Art such a note of disgrace by his
friends oversight before, but that now the same is taken away, and his worthy
knowledge much more graced by this second travail. Now to acquaynt thee with
the Auctors order in this second work, he has for variety gone through the
Psalms twice, which are now divided into two Setts: whereof in the former the
ordinary singing part is carried in the Tenor: In the second set it is conveyed
in the highest part. Herein there is required of the Reader, if he be a lover of
Music, that he would accept of their labor that have taken pains in
publishing exactlie a work of such singular skill, and special use for them,
that after the serious labor of their calling are desirous rather to recreate
them selves in singing of Psalms, then in other exercises of less comfort,
and evil mark.

William Swayne.

Veni Creator.
^ COme ho- ly Ghost eternal God, eter- nall God, proceeding from ^ above, ij.
both from ye father and the Son, ye God of peace and love, visit ^ our minds
and into us, and into us, thy heavenly grace inspire, ij. That in ^ all truth
and godliness, and godliness, we may have true desire. we may have true desire.

The humble suit of a sinner.
^ O Lord of whom I do depend, behold my careful heart: and ^ when thy will
and pleasure is, release me of my smart. Thou see my sorrows ^ what they
are, my grife is known to thee: and there is none, that can remove, ^ or take
the same from me.

Te Deum.
^ WE praise the God, we knowledge thee, the ^ only Lord to be. And as
eternal Father all, the ^ earth does worship thee. To thee all Angels cry,
the heavens and all the ^ powers therein: To the Cherub and Seraphin, and
Seraphin, to cry they do not ^ linne. to cry they do not linne.

The song of the three Children.
^ O All ye works of God the Lord, O all ye ^ works of God the Lord, bless
ye the Lord, bless ^ ye the Lord, praise him and magnify him for ever. for
ever.

Benedictus.
^ THe only Lord of Israel, of Israel, be praised ^ evermore: For through
his vi- si- ta- ti- on, and mercy ^ kept in store, his people now he has
redeemd, he has redeemd, that long has ^ been in thrall, and spread abroad
his saving health, and spread abroad his saving ^ health, upon his servants
all. his servants all.

Magnificat.
^ MY soul does magnify the Lord, does magnify the ^ Lord, my sprite eke
evermore, rejoices in the Lord ^ my God, the Lord my God, which is my savior
my savior. And why because he ^ did regard, and gave respect unto, respect
unto, so base estate of his handmaid, ^ of his handmaid, and let the mighty
go. and let the mighty go.

Nune dimittis.
^ O Lord because my hearts desire, has wished long to ^ see: My only Lord
and Savior, thy son before I dye: ^ the joy and health of all mankind,
desired long before, which now is come in ^ to the world, of mercy bringing
store.

Quicunque vult.
^ WHat man soever he be that salvation will attain: The ^ catholic belief
he must, belief he must, before all things re- ^ taine. Which Faith unless he
holy keep, he holy keep, and vndefiledly, defiledly, ^ Without all doubt
eternally, eternally, he shall be sure to dye. he shall be sure to dye.

The Lamentation of a sinner.
^ O Lord turn not away thy face, turn not away thy face, ^ from him that
lies prostrate, that lies prostrate: Lamenting ^ sore his sinful life, his
sinful life, before thy mercy gate. Which gate thou openest ^ wide to those,
thou openest wide to those, that do lament their sin, shut not that ^ gate
against me Lord, but let me enter in.

The Lords prayer.
^ Our Father which in heaven art, Lord hallowed ^ be thy name. Thy kingdom
come, thy will be done in ^ earth even as the same, in earth even as the same in
^ heaven is. Give us O Lord our daily bread this day, our daily bread this day,
as ^ we forgive our debtors so, forgive our debts we pray. Into temptation
lead us ^ not, from evil make us free, for kingdom power and glory thine,
both now and ever ^ be. both now and ever be.

The X Commandments.
^ Hark Israel and what I say, Hark Israel and what I say, give heed to
under- ^ stand, I am ye Lord thy God that brought thee out of Egypt Land. Even
from the ^ house wherein thou did, in thraldom live a slave. None other Gods
at all before my ^ presence shall thou have. my presence shall thou have. my
presence shall thou have.

The complaint of a sinner.
^ WHere righteousness does say, Lord for my ^ sinful part, In wrath thou
should me pay, ^ thou should me pay, vengeance for my de- ^ sert, I can it
not deny but needs I must confess, how that continually, thy ^ laws I do
transgress, thy laws I do transgress.

Here begins the Psalms.
Psalm. 1
^ THe man is blessed yt has not bent, yt has not bent to wicked read his ^
ear, Nor led his life as sinners do, nor sat in scorners chair: But in the
law of ^ God the Lord, does set his whole delight, his whole delight, and in
that law does ^ exercise, him self both day and night. him self both day and
night.

Psalm. 3.
^ O Lord how are my foes increast, my foes increst, which vex me ^ more and
more? They kill my heart when as they say, when as they say, God can him ^ not
restore. But thou O Lord art my defense, when I am hard bestead: My worship ^
and mine honor both, mine honor both, and thou houldst up my head. houldst up
my head.

Psalm. 6.
^ LOrd in thy wrath reprove me not, reprove me not though ^ I deserve thine
ire, though I deserve thine ire: Ne yet cor ^ rect me in thy rage, correct me
in thy rage, O Lord I thee desire, I thee desire. For ^ I am weak, for I am
weak, therefore O Lord, of mercy me forbear, and heal me ^ Lord, for why?
thou know my bones do quake for fear my bones do quake for fear.

Psalm. 14.
^ THere is no God as foolish men affirm, in ^ their mad mood: affirm in
their mad mood: there ^ driftes are all corrupt and vain, corrupt and vain,
not one of them does good. The ^ Lord beheld from heaven hye, from heaven hye,
the whole race of mankind, and ^ saw not one that sought in deed, the living
God to find. the living God to find.

Psalm. 18.
^ O God my strength and fortitude, and fortitude, of ^ force I must love thee:
Thou art my castle and defense, my ^ castle and defense, in my necessity. My
God my rock in whom I trust, the ^ worker of my wealth: My refuge buckler and
my shield, the horn of all my ^ health. the horn of all my health.

Psalm. 21.
^ O Lord how joyful is the king, how joyful is the ^ king, in thy strength
and thy power: How vehemently does ^ he rejoice, does he rejoice, in thee his
Savior. For thou have given unto him, for ^ thou have given unto him, his
godly hearts desire: To him nothing have thou de- ^ nide, have thou denide, of
that he did require, of that he did require.

Psalm. 23.
^ MY Shepherd is the living Lord, ye living Lord, no- ^ thing therefore I
need: In pastures fair, with waters ^ calm with waters calm, he set me for
to feed. he set me for to feed.

Psalm. 25.
^ I Lift mine heart to thee, I lift mine heart to thee, ^ my God and guide most
just: Now suffer me, to ^ take no shame, to take no shame, for in thee do I
tust. Let not my foes re- ^ joyce, my foes rejoice, not make a scorn of me, a
scorn of me: And let them ^ not be overthrown, that put their trust in thee.
that put their trust in thee.

Psalm. 25. BASSVS. An other of the same.
^ I Lift mine heart to thee, mine heart to thee, my ^ God and guide most just:
and guide most just: Now suffer ^ me to take no shame, for in thee do I trust.

Psalm. 30.
^ ALL laud and praise with heart and voice, and praise with ^ heart and voice,
O Lord I give to thee, I give to thee, which ^ did not make my foes rejoice,
my foes rejoice, but have exalted me. O Lord my ^ God, to thee I cryde, in all
my pain and grief: Thou gave an ear and did pro- ^ uide, and dydst
provide, to ease me with relief.

Psalm. 41.
^ THe man is blessed that careful is, the needy to con- ^ sider: For in the
season perilous, the Lord will him deliver. ^ The Lord will make him safe and
sound, and happy in the land: and he will not de- ^ liver him, deliver him,
into his enemies hand. into his enemies hand.

Psalm. 44.
^ Our ears have heard our fathers tell, our fathers tell, and ^ reverently
record: the wondrous works that thou have ^ done, that thou have done, in
older time O Lord. How thou did cast the Gentiles ^ out, the Gentiles out,
and stroydst them with strong hand, planting our fathers in their ^ place, and
gave to them their land their land, and gave to them their land.

Psalm. 46.
^ THe Lord is our de- fence and aid, the strength where- ^ by we stand: when
we with woe are much dismayed, are much dis- ^ maid he is our help at hand, he
is our help at hand. Though thearth remove we ^ will not fear Though hills so
high and steep, so high and steep, be thrust and ^ hurled here and there,
here and there, within the Sea so deep. within the Sea so deep.

Psalm. 50.
^ THe mighty God theternall has thus spoke, and ^ all the world he will call
and provoke, even from the ^ East, and so forth to the West, and so forth to
the West. From toward Syon which ^ place him likes best, which place him
likes best, God will appear in beauty ^ most excellent, Our God will come,
ij. be-fore that long time be spent.

Psalm. 51.
^ O Lord consider my distress, consider my distress and ^ now with speed
some pity take: My sins de- face my ^ faults redress, my faults redress,
good Lord for thy great mercies sake. Wash me O ^ Lord, Wash me O Lord, and
make me clean, and make me clean, from this un- ^ just and sinful act: and
purify yet once again, my heinous crime and bloody ^ fact. my heinous crime
and bloody fact.

Psalm. 52.
^ WHy do thou tyrant boast abroad, thy wicked works ^ to praise? do
thou not know there is a God, there is a ^ God, whose mercies last always? Why
does thy mind yet still devise, yet still devise, ^ such wicked wiles to
warpe? Thy tongue untrue in forging lies, in forging lies is ^ like a rasour
sharp.

Psalm. 59.
^ SEnd aid and save me from my foes, save me from my ^ foes, O Lord I pray to
thee: Defend and keep me from all ^ those, and keep me from all those, that
rise and strive with me. O Lord preserve me ^ from those men, whose doings are
not good: And set me sure and safe from them, ^ and safe from them, that
thirsts after blood. that thirsts after blood.

Psalm. 61.
^ REgard O Lord for I complain, Regard O Lord for I com- ^ plain, and make
my suit to thee: Let not my word re- ^ turn in vain, return in vain, but
give an ear to me. From of the coasts and utmost ^ parts, and utmost parts,
of all the earth abroad: in grief and anguish of my heart, ^ I cry to thee O
God.

Psalm. 68.
^ LEt God arise and then his foes, and then his foes, will ^ turn them selves
to flight: His enemies then will run abroad, ^ and scatter out of sight. And as
the fire does melt the wax, does melt the ^ wax, and wind blow smoke away:
So in the presence of ye Lord, the wicked shall de- ^ cay. the wicked shall
decay. the wicked shall decay* shall decay.

Psalm. 69.
^ Save me O God and that with speed, and that with speed, ^ the waters flow
full fast: So nigh my soul do they pro- ^ ceede, that I am sore aghast. I
stick full deep in filth and clay, in filth and clay, ^ whereas I feel no
ground: I fall into such floods I say, that I am like be drowned.

Psalm. 72.
^ LOrd give thy judgments to the King, thy judgments to the king, ^ therein
instruct him well: And with his son that princely thing that ^ princely
thing, Lord let thy justice dwell. That he may govern uprightly, govern ^
uprightly, and rule thy folk a right: and so defend through equity, the poor
that ^ have no might. the poor that have no might.

Psalm. 77.
^ I With my voice to God do cry, to God do cry, with ^ heart and hearty
cheer: My voice to God, my voice to God I ^ lift on high, and he my su^e does

took: But stretched my hands to him abroad, to ^ him abroad, my soul comfort
forsook. comfort forsook.

Psalm. 78.
^ ATtend my people to my Law, and to my words in- ^ cline: My mouth shall
